Matthew 0:0 <div osisID="Matt" sID="gen1" type="book"/>
Matthew 1:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.1" sID="gen2"/>
Matthew 1:1 <hi type="bold">The</hi> book of the genealogy of <hi type="bold">Jesus Christ</hi>, <transChange>the</transChange> son of David, <transChange>the</transChange> son of Abraham.
Matthew 1:2 Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
Matthew 1:3 and Judah had Phares and Zara by Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom,
Matthew 1:4 and Esrom begat Aram, and Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,
Matthew 1:5 and Salmon had Booz by Rahab, and Booz had Obed by Ruth,
Matthew 1:6 and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David the king, and David had Solomon by her <transChange>who had been the wife</transChange> of Uriah.
Matthew 1:7 And Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia,
Matthew 1:8 and Abia begat Asa, and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram,
Matthew 1:9 and Joram begat Ozias, and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Ezechias,
Matthew 1:10 and Ezechias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon,
Matthew 1:11 and Amon begat Josias, and Josias begat Jakim, and Jakim begat Jechonias and his brethren, about <transChange>the time</transChange> of their being carried away to Babylon.
Matthew 1:12 And after the captivity of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel,
Matthew 1:13 and Salathiel begat Zorobabel, and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
Matthew 1:14 and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim,
Matthew 1:15 and Achim begat Eliud, and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
Matthew 1:16 and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born <hi type="bold">Jesus</hi> <transChange>who is</transChange> called <hi type="bold">Christ.</hi>
Matthew 1:17 All the generations therefore from Abraham to David <transChange>are</transChange> fourteen generations: and from David until the captivity of Babylon fourteen generations: and from the Babylonish captivity unto Christ, fourteen generations.
Matthew 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in wise: when Mary his mother was promised in marriage to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Ghost:
Matthew 1:19 but Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was inclined to break off the contract with her privately;
Matthew 1:20 and when he was thinking on these <transChange>things,</transChange> behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph <transChange>thou</transChange> Son of David, scruple not to take <transChange>unto thee</transChange> Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
Matthew 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
Matthew 1:22 (Now all this came to pass, that it might be fulfilled, which the Lord spake by the prophet, saying,
Matthew 1:23 "Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and <transChange>they</transChange> shall call his name Emmanuel," which is God with us.)
Matthew 1:24 So Joseph, when he awoke from <transChange>his</transChange> sleep, did as the angel of the Lord directed him, and took home his wife:
Matthew 1:25 and he knew her not, till she brought forth her Son the first-born, and he called his name Jesus. <chapter eID="gen2" osisID="Matt.1"/>
Matthew 2:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.2" sID="gen28"/>
Matthew 2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came <transChange>certain</transChange> wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
Matthew 2:2 saying, Where is the king of the Jews that is born <transChange>here?</transChange> for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him.
Matthew 2:3 And when Herod the king heard <transChange>it,</transChange> he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him:
Matthew 2:4 and having summoned together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he enquired of them where the Messiah was to be born: and they told him, at Bethlehem in Judea;
Matthew 2:5 for thus it is written by the prophet,
Matthew 2:6 "And thou Bethlehem <transChange>in</transChange> the land of Juda art not the meanest among <transChange>the cities of</transChange> the princes of Juda; for out of thee shall come forth a ruler, that shall feed my people Israel."
Matthew 2:7 Then Herod called the wise men <transChange>to him</transChange> privately, and inquired of them exactly the time of the star's appearing:
Matthew 2:8 and sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and make diligent search for the child, and when ye have found <transChange>Him,</transChange> let me know, that I also may come and worship Him.
Matthew 2:9 When they had heard the king, they went: and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went on before them, till it came and stood over <transChange>the place</transChange> where the child was.
Matthew 2:10 And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy;
Matthew 2:11 and coming into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped Him: and when they had opened their treasures, they brought Him presents, <transChange>of</transChange> gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Matthew 2:12 And being warned of God in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back into their own country another way.
Matthew 2:13 And when they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Rise and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and continue there, untill I tell thee <transChange>to return:</transChange> for Herod will seek the child to destroy Him.
Matthew 2:14 And he arose and took the child and his mother by night, and went away into Egypt:
Matthew 2:15 and stayed there till the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spake by the prophet, saying, " Out of Egypt have I called my Son."
Matthew 2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was baffled by the wise-men, was very much enraged; and he sent and slew all the male-children in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly inquired of the wise-men.
Matthew 2:17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet,
Matthew 2:18 saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
Matthew 2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
Matthew 2:20 saying, Arise and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they, that sought the child's life, are dead.
Matthew 2:21 And he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel:
Matthew 2:22 but when he heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither; however being warned of God in a dream, he retired into the district of Galilee.
Matthew 2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. <chapter eID="gen28" osisID="Matt.2"/>
Matthew 3:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.3" sID="gen52"/>
Matthew 3:1 Now in those days came John the baptist preaching in the desert <transChange>part</transChange> of Judea,
Matthew 3:2 and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand:
Matthew 3:3 for this is He who was spoken of by Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the desert, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
Matthew 3:4 And this John had his clothes of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew 3:5 Then went, out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan,
Matthew 3:6 and they were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
Matthew 3:7 But when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Matthew 3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits becoming: penitents: and do not say within your selves,
Matthew 3:9 "We have Abraham <transChange>for our</transChange> father:" for I tell you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
Matthew 3:10 And now the ax is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore, which yieldeth not good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.
Matthew 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry: He shall baptize you with the holy Spirit and with fire.
Matthew 3:12 Whose fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and gather the wheat into his granary, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
Matthew 3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized by him: but John refused Him, saying,
Matthew 3:14 I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?
Matthew 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Permit <transChange>it</transChange> now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</q>
Matthew 3:16 Then he permitted Him. And Jesus as soon as He was baptized came up from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened unto Him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon Him:
Matthew 3:17 and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. <chapter eID="gen52" osisID="Matt.3"/>
Matthew 4:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.4" sID="gen70"/>
Matthew 4:1 Then was Jesus led by the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil:
Matthew 4:2 and when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, at last He was <transChange>very</transChange> hungry.
Matthew 4:3 And the tempter came to Him and said, If thou art the Son of God, command these stones to become bread:
Matthew 4:4 but He answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is written, "Man shall not live upon bread only, but on whatever proceedeth from the mouth of God."</q>
Matthew 4:5 Then the devil taketh Him into the holy city, and setteth Him on a wing of the temple,
Matthew 4:6 and saith unto Him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it is written, He will give his angels charge concerning thee, and they shall bear thee up <transChange>as</transChange> in their hands, least at any time thou shouldst dash thy foot against a stone:
Matthew 4:7 <transChange>but</transChange> Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">it is also written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</q>
Matthew 4:8 Again the devil taketh Him to a very high mountain, and sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
Matthew 4:9 and saith unto Him, All these <transChange>things</transChange> will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me:
Matthew 4:10 then Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be gone, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,</q>
Matthew 4:11 and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil left Him, and behold angels came and attended Him.
Matthew 4:12 Now when Jesus heard that John was imprisoned, He departed into Galilee:
Matthew 4:13 and leaving Nazareth He came and dwelt in Capernaum a maritime <transChange>town,</transChange> on the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
Matthew 4:14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, "The land of Zabulon,
Matthew 4:15 and Nephthalim, <transChange>by</transChange> the way of the sea,
Matthew 4:16 about Jordan, Galilee of the gentiles, the people that sat in darkness, saw a great light, and to them, who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up."
Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</q>
Matthew 4:18 Now <transChange>as</transChange> Jesus <transChange>was</transChange> walking by the sea of Galilee, <transChange>He</transChange> saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; (for they were fishermen:)
Matthew 4:19 and He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Come with me, and I will make you fishers of men:</q>
Matthew 4:20 and they immediately left their nets, and followed Him.
Matthew 4:21 And going on from thence He saw two other brethren, James <transChange>the son</transChange> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets;
Matthew 4:22 and He called them <transChange>also;</transChange> and they immediately left the ship, and their father, and followed Him.
Matthew 4:23 And Jesus went through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom <transChange>of heaven,</transChange> and healing every disease and every malady among the people.
Matthew 4:24 And his fame spread abroad into all Syria; and they brought unto Him all <transChange>their</transChange> sick, that laboured under various diseases and torments; even those who were possessed with devils, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them:
Matthew 4:25 and great multitudes of people followed Him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, <transChange>yea</transChange> and <transChange>from</transChange> beyond Jordan. <chapter eID="gen70" osisID="Matt.4"/>
Matthew 5:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.5" sID="gen96"/>
Matthew 5:1 And seeing the multitudes He went up to a mountain, and when He was set down, His disciples came to Him,
Matthew 5:2 and He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
Matthew 5:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</q>
Matthew 5:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.</q>
Matthew 5:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.</q>
Matthew 5:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be satisfied.</q>
Matthew 5:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy.</q>
Matthew 5:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> the pure in heart; for they shall see God.</q>
Matthew 5:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> the peace-makers; for they shall be called the children of God.</q>
Matthew 5:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> they, who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</q>
Matthew 5:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> ye when <transChange>men</transChange> shall revile and persecute you, and utter all manner of reproach against you falsly, for my sake:</q>
Matthew 5:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great <transChange>will be</transChange> your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets, <transChange>that were</transChange> before you.</q>
Matthew 5:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt be grown insipid, wherewith shall it be seasoned? it is no longer fit for any thing, but to be thrown out <transChange>of doors,</transChange> and trodden under foot.</q>
Matthew 5:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye are the light of the world: a city, <transChange>that is</transChange> situated on a hill, cannot be hid.</q>
Matthew 5:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Nor do <transChange>men</transChange> light a candle, to put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick: and then it giveth light to all in the house.</q>
Matthew 5:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father, who is in heaven.</q>
Matthew 5:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Think not that I am come to abrogate the law, or the prophets: I am not come to abolish, but to compleat <transChange>them:</transChange></q>
Matthew 5:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass <transChange>away,</transChange> not one jot nor one tittle shall pass from the law, till all be compleated.</q>
Matthew 5:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whosoever therefore shall break one of the left of these commandments, and <transChange>thereby</transChange> teach men so <transChange>to do,</transChange> he shall be esteemed very little in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do as well as teach <transChange>them,</transChange> he shall be accounted great in the kingdom of heaven.</q>
Matthew 5:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceed <transChange>that</transChange> of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</q>
Matthew 5:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever committeth murder, shall be liable to the judgment:</q>
Matthew 5:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be obnoxious to the council; but whosoever shall say, "Thou fool," shall be in danger of hell-fire.</q>
Matthew 5:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Therefore, if thou bring thine offering to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath any <transChange>complaint</transChange> against thee;</q>
Matthew 5:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">leave thy gift there before the altar, and go <transChange>and</transChange> first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</q>
Matthew 5:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be friends with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; least the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison:</q>
Matthew 5:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt not come out from thence, till thou hast paid the <transChange>very</transChange> last farthing.</q>
Matthew 5:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</q>
Matthew 5:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I tell you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, <transChange>so as</transChange> to lust after her, hath already debauched her in his heart.</q>
Matthew 5:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And <transChange>therefore</transChange> if thy right eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one part of thee perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell:</q>
Matthew 5:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy limbs should perish, than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</q>
Matthew 5:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And it has been said, whosoever would put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce:</q>
Matthew 5:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except on account of whoredom, tempteth her to commit adultery; and if any <transChange>man</transChange> marry her that is divorced, he committeth adultery.</q>
Matthew 5:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Again, ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</q>
Matthew 5:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;</q>
Matthew 5:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King: neither shalt thou swear by thy head,</q>
Matthew 5:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for thou canst not make one hair <transChange>of it</transChange> white or black:</q>
Matthew 5:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but let your conversation be yea, yea; no, no; for whatever is more than these, cometh from the evil <transChange>one.</transChange></q>
Matthew 5:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye have heard, that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</q>
Matthew 5:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I say unto you, Set not yourselves against him that injures you, but if any <transChange>one</transChange> smite thee on thy right cheek, <transChange>rather</transChange> turn to him the other also:</q>
Matthew 5:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if any <transChange>one</transChange> would go to law with thee, to take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also, <transChange>rather than strive with him:</transChange></q>
Matthew 5:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if any <transChange>one</transChange> shall force thee one mile, go with him two.</q>
Matthew 5:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Give to him that asketh thee, and him, that would borrow of thee, turn not away.</q>
Matthew 5:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye have heard, that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy:</q>
Matthew 5:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that abuse you and persecute you;</q>
Matthew 5:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that ye may be the children of your heavenly Father; for He causeth his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust.</q>
Matthew 5:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For if ye love <transChange>only</transChange> them that love you, what reward do ye expect? do not even the publicans the same?</q>
Matthew 5:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if ye embrace your brethren only, what do ye more <transChange>than others?</transChange> do not the publicans so likewise?</q>
Matthew 5:48 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be ye therefore perfect <transChange>in love and goodness,</transChange> as your Father <transChange>who is</transChange> in heaven is perfect.</q> <chapter eID="gen96" osisID="Matt.5"/>
Matthew 6:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.6" sID="gen145"/>
Matthew 6:1 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be observed by them: otherwise ye <transChange>will</transChange> have no reward from your Father, who is in heaven.</q>
Matthew 6:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Therefore when thou dost an alms-<transChange>deed,</transChange> do not proclaim <transChange>it</transChange> abroad, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may be applauded by men. Verily I tell you, they have their reward.</q>
Matthew 6:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when thou givest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth:</q>
Matthew 6:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that thine alms may be in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will himself reward thee openly.</q>
Matthew 6:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when thou prayest, be not like the hypocrites; for they love to pray in public assemblies, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be taken notice of by men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</q>
Matthew 6:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father <transChange>who is</transChange> in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.</q>
Matthew 6:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do, for they think they shall be heard for their speaking much:</q>
Matthew 6:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">be not ye therefore like them; for your Father knoweth what ye have need of before ye ask Him.</q>
Matthew 6:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">After this manner therefore pray ye,</q>
Matthew 6:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done, as in heaven <transChange>so</transChange> also upon earth;</q>
Matthew 6:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">give us this day our daily bread;</q>
Matthew 6:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;</q>
Matthew 6:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil <transChange>one:</transChange> for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. Amen."</q>
Matthew 6:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For if ye forgive men their faults, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</q>
Matthew 6:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but if ye forgive not men their transgressions, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</q>
Matthew 6:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when ye fast, be not, like the hypocrites, of a gloomy countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may be observed by men to fast: I tell you, they have indeed their reward.</q>
Matthew 6:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head and wash thy face;</q>
Matthew 6:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that thou mayst not appear unto men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.</q>
Matthew 6:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust corrupts, and where thieves break through and steal:</q>
Matthew 6:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</q>
Matthew 6:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</q>
Matthew 6:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The eye is the light of the body: if therefore thine eye be clear, thy whole body will be light;</q>
Matthew 6:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but if thine eye be bad, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light <transChange>that is</transChange> in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</q>
Matthew 6:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or at lest he will be attached to the one, and neglect the other: ye cannot serve God and mammon:</q>
Matthew 6:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body than raiment?</q>
Matthew 6:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Look at the birds of the air; they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns: and <transChange>yet</transChange> your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye preferable to them?</q>
Matthew 6:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And which of you by all his thought can add one cubit to his stature?</q>
Matthew 6:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And why are ye sollicitous about raiment? consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I tell you,</q>
Matthew 6:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</q>
Matthew 6:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now if God so clothe the grass of the field, which <transChange>is growing</transChange> to-day, and to-morrow is cast into the fire, <transChange>will He</transChange> not much more <transChange>clothe</transChange> you, O ye of little faith?</q>

Matthew 8:23 And when He was entered into the ship, his disciples followed Him:
Matthew 8:24 and behold a great tempest rose on the sea, so that the vessel was <transChange>even</transChange> covered by the waves; but He was asleep.
Matthew 8:25 And His disciples came to Him, and awoke Him, saying, Lord save us, <transChange>for</transChange> we are perishing: and He saith unto them,
Matthew 8:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why are ye <transChange>so</transChange> frighted, O ye of little faith?</q> Then He rose up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
Matthew 8:27 And the men wondered, saying, What <transChange>an amazing</transChange> person is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him!
Matthew 8:28 And when He was come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demoniacs coming out from the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no one could pass by that way:

Matthew 8:30 Now there was at some distance from them a large herd of swine seeding: and the devils besought Him,

Matthew 9:3 Upon which, some of the scribes said in themselves, This <transChange>man</transChange> blasphemeth: but Jesus knowing their surmises,
Matthew 9:4 said <transChange>to them,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why think ye evil in your hearts?</q>
Matthew 9:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For which is easier? To say, thy sins be forgiven thee? or to say, rise up and walk?</q>
Matthew 9:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, Arise</q> (saith He then to the paralytic) <q marker="" who="Jesus">and take up thy couch, and go away to thy house.</q>
Matthew 9:7 And he rose up and went away to his own house.
Matthew 9:8 But when the multitudes saw it, they were amazed, and glorified God, who had given such power to men.
Matthew 9:9 And as Jesus was passing from thence, He saw a man sitting at the custom-<transChange>house,</transChange> named Matthew; and He saith to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Follow me:</q> and he rose up and followed Him.
Matthew 9:10 And as He was sitting at table in the house <transChange>of Matthew,</transChange> behold, several publicans and <transChange>notorious</transChange> sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
Matthew 9:11 And when the Pharisees saw <transChange>it,</transChange> they said to his disciples, Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?
Matthew 9:12 But Jesus hearing <transChange>them,</transChange> said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill: go therefore and learn what that means,</q>
Matthew 9:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">"I desire mercy rather than sacrifice:" for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.</q>
Matthew 9:14 Then <transChange>also</transChange> come to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the pharisees fast much, but thy disciples do not fast?
Matthew 9:15 And Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, while the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.</q>
Matthew 9:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">As no one putteth a piece of new cloth to an old garment; for its <transChange>new</transChange> patch teareth away from the <transChange>old</transChange> garment, and the rent is made worse:</q>
Matthew 9:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">nor do they put new wine into old vessels; otherwise, the casks burst, and the wine is spilt, and the vessels are destroyed: but they put new wine into new vessels, and both are preserved.</q>
Matthew 9:18 As He was speaking these <transChange>things</transChange> to them, behold there came a ruler and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is at the point of death: but come, <transChange>I pray Thee,</transChange> and put thy hand upon her, and she shall live:
Matthew 9:19 and Jesus rose up, and followed him; <transChange>as</transChange> did also his disciples.
Matthew 9:20 (And lo, a woman who had had a flux of blood for twelve years, came close behind <transChange>Him,</transChange> and touched the hem of his garment:
Matthew 9:21 for she said within herself, If I can but touch his garment, I shall be cured.
Matthew 9:22 And Jesus turning about, and seeing her, said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Daughter be comforted, thy faith hath cured thee.</q> And from that time the woman was healed.)
Matthew 9:23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the musicians, and the people in confusion;
Matthew 9:24 He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Retire; for the child is not dead, but asleep.</q> And they laughed at Him.
Matthew 9:25 But when the people were put out, He went in and took hold of her hand, and the damsel rose up.
Matthew 9:26 And the fame of it spread over all the country.
Matthew 9:27 And as Jesus was going from thence, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Have compassion on us, O Son of David.
Matthew 9:28 And when He was come into the house, the blind men came to Him: and Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye believe that I am able to do this?</q> <transChange>and</transChange> they say unto Him, Yes Lord.
Matthew 9:29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">According to your faith be it done unto you:</q> and their eyes were opened.
Matthew 9:30 And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do not divulge <transChange>it:</transChange></q> but
Matthew 9:31 they went out and spread his fame through all that country.
Matthew 9:32 And as they were going out, there was brought to Him a dumb man, a demoniac:
Matthew 9:33 and when the demon was cast out, the dumb <transChange>man</transChange> spake; and the multitudes were amazed, saying, there had never been seen the like in Israel:
Matthew 9:34 but the pharisees said, he casts out devils by the prince of the devils.
Matthew 9:35 Now Jesus went round <transChange>to</transChange> all the cities, and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom <transChange>of heaven,</transChange> and healing every disease, and every malady among the people.
Matthew 9:36 And when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion towards them; because they were dispersed and scattered like sheep that have no shepherd:
Matthew 9:37 upon which He saith to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers few:</q>
Matthew 9:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest, that He would send out laborers into his harvest.</q> <chapter eID="gen245" osisID="Matt.9"/>

Matthew 10:1 And He called unto Him his twelve disciples, and gave them power over impure spirits, even to cast them out; and to cure all diseases and every malady whatsoever.
Matthew 10:2 Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; Philip, and Bartholomew;
Matthew 10:3 Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James <transChange>the son</transChange> of Alpheus, and Lebbeus <transChange>who was</transChange> surnamed Thaddeus;
Matthew 10:4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, even he that betrayed Him.
Matthew 10:5 These twelve did Jesus send forth, and commanded them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go not among the gentiles, neither enter into <transChange>any</transChange> city of <transChange>the</transChange> Samaritans:</q>

Matthew 11:1 And when Jesus had made an end of giving orders to his twelve disciples, He departed from thence to teach and preach in their cities.
Matthew 11:2 Now when John heard in prison of the works of Christ,
Matthew 11:3 he sent two of his disciples to ask Him, Art thou He who was to come, or are we to expect another?
Matthew 11:4 And Jesus said to them in answer, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go and tell John <transChange>the things</transChange> which ye hear and see:</q>
Matthew 11:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">the blind are restored to sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised <transChange>to life,</transChange> and the poor have the gospel preached <transChange>to them:</transChange></q>

Matthew 11:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But what went ye out to see? a man clad in fine attire? they that wear rich <transChange>clothes</transChange> are in the palaces of kings.</q>

Matthew 11:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted even to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell: for if the miracles, <transChange>which have been</transChange> wrought in thee, had been wrought in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day.</q>
Matthew 11:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Moreover I tell you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgement, than for thee.</q>
Matthew 11:25 <transChange>And</transChange> upon this occasion Jesus opened his mouth and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these <transChange>things</transChange> from the wise and knowing, and hast revealed them to babes:</q>
Matthew 11:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">even so, Father, for it was thy good pleasure <transChange>that</transChange> so <transChange>it should be."</transChange></q>
Matthew 11:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">All <transChange>things</transChange> are delivered to me by my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor does any <transChange>one</transChange> know the Father, but the Son, and <transChange>he</transChange> to whom the Son is pleased to reveal <transChange>Him.</transChange></q>
Matthew 11:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Come unto me <transChange>therefore</transChange> all ye who are labouring and oppressed, and I will give you ease.</q>
Matthew 11:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take <transChange>but</transChange> my yoke upon you, and learn of me, (for I am meek and lowly in heart,) and ye shall find refreshment to your souls:</q>
Matthew 11:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for my yoke is easy, and my burthen is light.</q> <chapter eID="gen327" osisID="Matt.11"/>
Matthew 12:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.12" sID="gen358"/>
Matthew 12:1 About this time as Jesus passed through the cornfields on the sabbath-day, his disciples being hungry began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat <transChange>them.</transChange>
Matthew 12:2 And when the pharisees saw <transChange>it</transChange> they said to Him, See, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful <transChange>for them</transChange> to do on the sabbath.
Matthew 12:3 But He replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have ye not read what David did, when he, and his attendants, were hungry? how he went into the house of God,</q>
Matthew 12:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and did eat the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor those that were with him; but for the priests only? or have ye not read in the law,</q>
Matthew 12:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">what profane <transChange>sort of</transChange> work the priests do in the temple on the sabbath-days, and <transChange>yet</transChange> are blameless?</q>
Matthew 12:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But I tell you, that a greater than the temple is here:</q>
Matthew 12:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if ye had known what that <transChange>scripture</transChange> means, "I desire mercy rather than sacrifice," ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</q>
Matthew 12:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.</q>
Matthew 12:9 And he went away and came into their synagogue: and there being a man <transChange>there</transChange> who had a withered hand,
Matthew 12:10 they asked Him, if it were lawful to heal on the sabbath-days? that they might accuse Him.
Matthew 12:11 But He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What man of you shall have one <transChange>of his</transChange> sheep fall into a pit on the sabbath-day, <transChange>and</transChange> will not lay hold of it and lift <transChange>it</transChange> out?</q>
Matthew 12:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And of how much more worth is a man than a sheep? <transChange>Sure</transChange> then it is lawful to do good on the sabbath-days.</q>
Matthew 12:13 Then saith He to the man, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Stretch out thine hand:</q> and he stretched <transChange>it</transChange> out, and it was made sound like the other.
Matthew 12:14 But the pharisees went out <transChange>of the synagogue</transChange> and took counsel together against Him, how they might destroy Him:
Matthew 12:15 but Jesus knew <transChange>it,</transChange> and withdrew from thence; and great multitudes followed Him <transChange>with their sick,</transChange>
Matthew 12:16 and he healed them all, charging them not to make Him known:
Matthew 12:17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Behold my servant whom I have chosen,
Matthew 12:18 my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon Him, and He shall declare judgement to the nations: He shall not contend,
Matthew 12:19 nor cry aloud, nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets:
Matthew 12:20 a bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax he will not extinguish, till He send forth judgement victorious.
Matthew 12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
Matthew 12:22 Then was brought to Him a demoniac, <transChange>who was</transChange> blind and dumb; and he healed Him, so that the blind and dumb <transChange>man</transChange> both spake and saw:
Matthew 12:23 and all the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Is not this the Son of David?"
Matthew 12:24 which the pharisees hearing, said, "He only casts out demons by <transChange>the help of</transChange> Beelzebub the prince of the devils."
Matthew 12:25 But Jesus, who <transChange>well</transChange> knew their thoughts, said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate; and no city, or family, divided against itself can stand:</q>
Matthew 12:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?</q>
Matthew 12:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if I cast out demons by <transChange>the power of</transChange> Beelzebub, by whom do your own people cast <transChange>them</transChange> out? wherefore they shall be your judges:</q>
Matthew 12:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, <transChange>then</transChange> certainly the kingdom of God is come unto you.</q>
Matthew 12:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Or, how can any <transChange>one</transChange> enter into the house of a strong <transChange>man,</transChange> and take away his goods, unless he first overpower the strong man? and then <transChange>indeed</transChange> he may strip his house.</q>
Matthew 12:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.</q>
Matthew 12:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wherefore, I tell you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the <transChange>holy</transChange> Spirit shall not be forgiven them:</q>
Matthew 12:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if any <transChange>one</transChange> speak against the Son of man, it may be forgiven him: but if any <transChange>one</transChange> speak against the holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this life, nor in that to come.</q>
Matthew 12:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Either allow the tree <transChange>to be</transChange> good, and it's fruit good; or shew the tree <transChange>to be</transChange> corrupt, and it's fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by <transChange>it's</transChange> fruit.</q>
Matthew 12:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">O race of vipers, how can ye speak good <transChange>things,</transChange> who are <transChange>yourselves so</transChange> wicked? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</q>
Matthew 12:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">A good man out of the good treasure of the heart produceth good <transChange>things;</transChange> and a wicked man out of the wicked treasure uttereth wicked <transChange>things:</transChange></q>
Matthew 12:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I tell you, that of every idle word, which men shall speak, they shall give an account in the day of judgement; for by thy words thou shalt be justified,</q>
Matthew 12:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</q>
Matthew 12:38 Then some of the scribes and pharisees answered <transChange>Him,</transChange> saying, Master, we should be glad to see a sign from thee:
Matthew 12:39 but He replied and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This wicked and degenerate race demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah:</q>
Matthew 12:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</q>
Matthew 12:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>So that</transChange> the men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold a greater than Jonas is here.</q>
Matthew 12:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The queen of the South <transChange>too,</transChange> shall rise up in the <transChange>day of</transChange> judgement against this generation, and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon <transChange>is</transChange> here.</q>
Matthew 12:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now when an impure spirit is gone out of a man, he wanders through dry <transChange>desert</transChange> places, seeking rest, and findeth none:</q>
Matthew 12:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">then saith he, I will return into my house, that I came out of; and when he cometh, he findeth it empty, swept, and set off to advantage:</q>
Matthew 12:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">then he goeth and taketh with <transChange>him</transChange> seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there; and <transChange>so</transChange> the last state of that man is worse than the first. And thus shall it be to this wicked generation.</q>
Matthew 12:46 Now as He was yet discoursing to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, and desired to speak to Him:
Matthew 12:47 and somebody said to Him, "Here are thy mother and thy brethren standing without, desiring to speak to thee."
Matthew 12:48 But in answer to him that told Him, He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?"</q>
Matthew 12:49 and stretching out his hand towards his disciples, He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Behold my mother and my brethren:"</q>
Matthew 12:50 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for whosoever doth the will of my Father <transChange>who is</transChange> in heaven, he is <transChange>to me as</transChange> my brother and sister and mother.</q> <chapter eID="gen358" osisID="Matt.12"/>
Matthew 13:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.13" sID="gen409"/>
Matthew 13:1 Now on the same day, Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea-side:
Matthew 13:2 and many people were gathered together to <transChange>bear</transChange> Him, so that He went into a ship and sat down, and all the multitude stood upon the shore; and He spake to them many <transChange>things</transChange> in parables,
Matthew 13:3 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Behold a sower went out to sow;</q>
Matthew 13:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and as he was sowing, some <transChange>seeds</transChange> fell by the way-<transChange>side,</transChange> and the birds came and ate them up:</q>
Matthew 13:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">some fell upon stony <transChange>places,</transChange> where they had not much earth; and they soon sprung up <transChange>indeed,</transChange> because they had no depth of earth;</q>
Matthew 13:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but when the sun rose, they were burnt up, and withered; because they had no root:</q>
Matthew 13:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and others fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:</q>
Matthew 13:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but others fell on good ground, and yielded fruit, some an hundred-<transChange>fold,</transChange> some sixty, and some thirty.</q>
Matthew 13:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."</q>
Matthew 13:10 And the disciples came to Him and said, Why dost thou speak to them in parables?
Matthew 13:11 And He answered them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Because it is granted unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not granted:</q>
Matthew 13:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for whosoever <transChange>really</transChange> hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundantly; but whosoever <transChange>thus</transChange> hath not, even <transChange>that</transChange> which he hath, shall be taken away from him:</q>
Matthew 13:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for this <transChange>reason</transChange> I speak to them in parables; because though they see, they will not see; and though they hear, they will not hear, nor understand.</q>
Matthew 13:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, Ye shall hear by <transChange>the</transChange> hearing <transChange>of the ear,</transChange> and not understand; and <transChange>in</transChange> seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is grown stupid,</q>
Matthew 13:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and their ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; least they should see at all with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</q>
Matthew 13:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But blessed <transChange>are</transChange> your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear:</q>
Matthew 13:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for indeed I tell you, that many prophets and righteous <transChange>men</transChange> have desired to see <transChange>the things</transChange> which ye see, and have not seen <transChange>them;</transChange> and to hear what ye hear, and have not heard <transChange>them.</transChange></q>
Matthew 13:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the <transChange>gospel</transChange>-kingdom,</q>
Matthew 13:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and regardeth it not, <transChange>then</transChange> cometh the wicked <transChange>one,</transChange> and snatcheth away that which was sown in his heart: this is he who received the seed <transChange>as</transChange> by the way-<transChange>side.</transChange></q>
Matthew 13:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he who received the seed <transChange>as</transChange> upon stony <transChange>grounds,</transChange> is one that heareth the word and immediately receiveth it with joy:</q>
Matthew 13:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">yet hath he no root in himself, <transChange>and therefore</transChange> is but for a <transChange>short</transChange> season; and when affliction cometh, or persecution on account of the word, he is <transChange>as</transChange> soon disgusted.</q>
Matthew 13:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he that received the seed among the thorns, is one that <transChange>likewise</transChange> heareth the word; but the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choketh the word, and <transChange>so</transChange> it becometh unfruitful.</q>
Matthew 13:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But he who received the seed into good ground, is one that heareth and understandeth the word, who indeed beareth fruit, and yieldeth, <transChange>like fertile lands,</transChange> some an hundred-<transChange>fold,</transChange> some sixty, some thirty.</q>
Matthew 13:24 Another parable propounded He unto them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The kingdom of heaven is like a man, who sowed good grain in his ground:</q>
Matthew 13:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but while men were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.</q>
Matthew 13:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now when the blade shot forth, and produced the corn, then the tares also appeared.</q>
Matthew 13:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">So the servants came to their master, and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then are the tares?</q>
Matthew 13:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he said unto them, <transChange>Some</transChange> enemy hath done this. The servants therefore said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</q>
Matthew 13:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But he said, No: least <transChange>in</transChange> plucking up the tares ye root up the corn along with them.</q>
Matthew 13:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let both grow together till harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather the weeds together, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but carry the wheat into my barn.</q>
Matthew 13:31 Another parable delivered He unto them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The gospel-kingdom is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.</q>
Matthew 13:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Which is indeed <transChange>one of</transChange> the lest of all seeds: but when it is grown, is the greatest among herbs, and <transChange>even</transChange> becometh a tree; so that the birds of the air come and lodge in it's branches.</q>
Matthew 13:33 Another parable spake He unto them, <transChange>saying,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">The gospel-kingdom is like leaven, which a woman took and put into a large quantity of dough, till the whole was leavened.</q>
Matthew 13:34 All these <transChange>things</transChange> spake Jesus in parables to the multitudes; and <transChange>at this time</transChange> He spake nothing to them without a parable:
Matthew 13:35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will publish <transChange>things</transChange> which have been concealed from the foundation of the world.
Matthew 13:36 Then Jesus leaving the multitude went into the house; and his disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field:
Matthew 13:37 and He answered them, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</q>
Matthew 13:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">the field is the world; the good seed are the children of <transChange>my</transChange> kingdom; and the tares are the children of the wicked <transChange>one.</transChange></q>
Matthew 13:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</q>
Matthew 13:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">As therefore the tares are gathered together, and burnt in the fire; so shall it be in the end of the world:</q>
Matthew 13:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man will send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all <transChange>that commit</transChange> offences, and those who do iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire,</q>
Matthew 13:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>and</transChange> there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</q>
Matthew 13:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>But</transChange> the righteous shall then shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</q>
Matthew 13:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which a man having found conceals, and being rejoiced at it goes and sells all that he has, and purchases that field.</q>
Matthew 13:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking precious pearls,</q>
Matthew 13:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">who, having found one of great value, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</q>
Matthew 13:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and inclosed <transChange>fishes</transChange> of various sorts;</q>
Matthew 13:48 <q marker="" who="Jesus">which, when it was full, they dragged to the shore, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, and threw out the bad.</q>
Matthew 13:49 <q marker="" who="Jesus">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous;</q>
Matthew 13:50 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and shall cast them into the fiery furnace, <transChange>and</transChange> there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</q>
Matthew 13:51 <transChange>Then</transChange> saith Jesus unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Did ye understand all these?</q> they say unto Him, Yes, Lord: and He said unto them,
Matthew 13:52 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Therefore every teacher, who has been <transChange>thus</transChange> instructed in <transChange>the knowledge of</transChange> the kingdom of heaven, is like a master of a family, who brings forth out of his store <transChange>things</transChange> new and old.</q>
Matthew 13:53 And when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence:
Matthew 13:54 and came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogues; so that they were amazed and said, Whence hath this <transChange>man</transChange> this wisdom and <transChange>these</transChange> powers?
Matthew 13:55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
Matthew 13:56 and his sisters, are they not all <transChange>here</transChange> among us? from whence then <transChange>hath</transChange> this <transChange>man</transChange> all these <transChange>things?</transChange>
Matthew 13:57 So they were prejudiced against Him. But Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">A prophet is no where less honoured than in his own country, and in his own family.</q>
Matthew 13:58 And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief. <chapter eID="gen409" osisID="Matt.13"/>
Matthew 14:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.14" sID="gen468"/>
Matthew 14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus,
Matthew 14:2 and said to his servants, This is John the baptist, he is <transChange>certainly</transChange> risen from the dead, and therefore miraculous things are done by him:
Matthew 14:3 for Herod had apprehended John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife;
Matthew 14:4 for John said to Him, It is not lawful for thee to have her: and he would have put him to death,
Matthew 14:5 but that he was afraid of the people; for they esteemed him as a prophet.
Matthew 14:6 But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before <transChange>them,</transChange> and pleased Herod, so
Matthew 14:7 that he promised <transChange>her</transChange> with an oath to give her whatever she would ask:
Matthew 14:8 and she, being before instructed by her mother, said, Give me here in a dish the head of John the baptist:
Matthew 14:9 at which the king was distressed, but because of his oath, and of those who sat at table with him, he ordered <transChange>it</transChange> to be given <transChange>her;</transChange>
Matthew 14:10 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison,
Matthew 14:11 and his head was brought in a dish, and given to the young princess, who carried <transChange>it</transChange> to her mother:
Matthew 14:12 and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it, and <transChange>then</transChange> went and told Jesus.
Matthew 14:13 And when Jesus heard <transChange>it,</transChange> He departed from thence in a ship to a solitary place of retirement: but the people hearing <transChange>where He was</transChange> followed Him on foot from the cities:
Matthew 14:14 and when Jesus came out <transChange>of the ship,</transChange> He saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them; and He healed their sick.
Matthew 14:15 Now when it was evening his disciples came to Him and said, <transChange>This</transChange> is a desert place, and <transChange>meal</transChange>-time is now past; dismiss the people, that they may go away to the towns, and buy themselves victuals.
Matthew 14:16 But Jesus said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">they have no need to go away, do ye give them <transChange>something</transChange> to eat.</q>
Matthew 14:17 And they said, we have nothing here but five loaves and two fishes:
Matthew 14:18 and He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">bring them hither to me.</q>
Matthew 14:19 And having ordered the multitudes to sit down upon the grass, and taken the five loaves and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven and blessed <transChange>them;</transChange> and He brake the loaves and gave <transChange>them</transChange> to the disciples, and the disciples to the people: and they did all eat, and were satisfied;
Matthew 14:20 and they took up what was left <transChange>even</transChange> of fragments twelve baskets full.
Matthew 14:21 Now they that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew 14:22 And presently after Jesus obliged the disciples to get into the ship, and to go before Him to the other side, while He dismissed the multitudes:
Matthew 14:23 and when He had dismissed them, He went up to a hill in private to pray.
Matthew 14:24 And in the evening He was there alone. Now the ship was by this time in the midst of the sea, <transChange>and</transChange> violently tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary:
Matthew 14:25 but in the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them walking on the sea:
Matthew 14:26 and when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were affrighted and said, It is an apparition;
Matthew 14:27 and they cried out for fear: but Jesus immediately spake to them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take courage, it is I, be not afraid.</q>
Matthew 14:28 Then Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come unto thee upon the waters.
Matthew 14:29 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Come.</q>
Matthew 14:30 And Peter went down from the ship and walked upon the waters to go to Jesus: but seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid, and beginning to sink cried out, Lord, save me.
Matthew 14:31 And Jesus, immediately stretching forth his hand, laid hold of him, and saith to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O <transChange>man</transChange> of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</q>
Matthew 14:32 So they got into the ship, and the wind ceased.
Matthew 14:33 Then they <transChange>that were</transChange> in the ship came and worshipped Him, saying, Thou art indeed the Son of God.
Matthew 14:34 And they passed over and came into the country of Gennesaret.
Matthew 14:35 And the men of that place getting knowledge of Him, sent into all that country about; and they brought to Him all that were ill;
Matthew 14:36 and intreated Him that they might but touch the border of his garment; and as many as touched <transChange>Him</transChange> were made perfectly well. <chapter eID="gen468" osisID="Matt.14"/>
Matthew 15:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.15" sID="gen505"/>
Matthew 15:1 Then came to Jesus the scribes and pharisees from Jerusalem saying,
Matthew 15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat.
Matthew 15:3 But He answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">And why do ye transgress the commandment of God for your tradition?</q>
Matthew 15:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For God commanded saying, Honour thy father and <transChange>thy</transChange> mother; and, He that revileth father or mother, let him be put to death:</q>
Matthew 15:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but ye say, If any <transChange>man</transChange> say to <transChange>his</transChange> father or mother, "that which thou mightest be profited by from me is a gift <transChange>to the temple,</transChange>"</q>
Matthew 15:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and <transChange>so</transChange> honour not his father or his mother, <transChange>he shall be free.</transChange> And <transChange>thus</transChange> have ye made void the commandment of God by your tradition.</q>
Matthew 15:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Well did Esaias prophecy concerning you,</q>
Matthew 15:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">saying, This people approach me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me:</q>
Matthew 15:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the injunctions of men.</q>
Matthew 15:10 And He called the multitude to Him, and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Hear and understand <transChange>it:</transChange></q>
Matthew 15:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this polluteth the man.</q>
Matthew 15:12 Whereupon his disciples came and said to Him, Dost thou know that the pharisees, when they heard this assertion, were offended <transChange>at it?</transChange>
Matthew 15:13 But He answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Every plantation which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.</q>
Matthew 15:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Regard them not; <transChange>for</transChange> they are blind guides of the blind: and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</q>
Matthew 15:15 Then Peter answered, and said unto Him, Explain to us this parable.
Matthew 15:16 And Jesus replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Are ye also still void of understanding?</q>
Matthew 15:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye not yet know, that whatever goeth into the mouth passeth to the belly and is discharged downwards?</q>
Matthew 15:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But the things, which proceed out of the mouth, come from the heart, and those defile a man.</q>
Matthew 15:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For out of the heart proceed wicked disputings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false-witnessings, slanders:</q>
Matthew 15:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">these defile a man, but to eat without washing the hands doth not defile him.</q>
Matthew 15:21 And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the parts adjacent to Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew 15:22 And there came out of those quarters a Canaanitish woman, and cried to Him saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <transChange>thou</transChange> son of David; for my daughter is grievously tormented by a demon.
Matthew 15:23 But he answered her not a word: and his disciples came and intreated Him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth <transChange>importunately</transChange> after us.
Matthew 15:24 But he answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</q>
Matthew 15:25 However, she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord help me.
Matthew 15:26 But he answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is not fit to take the children's bread and throw it to dogs:</q> and she said, True, Lord;
Matthew 15:27 yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.
Matthew 15:28 Then Jesus answering, said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O woman, great <transChange>is</transChange> thy faith: be it <transChange>therefore</transChange> unto thee as thou desirest.</q> And her daughter was cured from that <transChange>very</transChange> hour.
Matthew 15:29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and going up to a mountain He sat down there.
Matthew 15:30 And great multitudes came to Him, having with them <transChange>those that were</transChange> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others; and laid them at the feet of Jesus, and He healed them.
Matthew 15:31 So that the people wondered when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed <transChange>become</transChange> sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew 15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples to <transChange>Him</transChange> and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am moved with compassion to the multitude, for they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: I will not let them go away fasting, least they faint in the way.</q>
Matthew 15:33 And his disciples replied, Whence can we have so much bread in <transChange>this</transChange> desert <transChange>place</transChange> as to satisfy so great a multitude?
Matthew 15:34 And Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How many loaves have ye?</q> and they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
Matthew 15:35 Then He bid the people sit down on the ground;
Matthew 15:36 and taking the seven loaves and the fishes, when He had given thanks, He brake <transChange>them,</transChange> and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
Matthew 15:37 And they did all eat, and were satisfied: and they took up what was left <transChange>even</transChange> of fragments seven baskets full.
Matthew 15:38 Now they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
Matthew 15:39 Then he dismissed the multitudes, and went into a ship, and came to the coasts of Magdala. <chapter eID="gen505" osisID="Matt.15"/>
Matthew 16:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.16" sID="gen545"/>
Matthew 16:1 And the pharisees and sadducees came to Him, and captiously asked Him to shew them a sign from heaven.
Matthew 16:2 But He answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">In the evening ye say, <transChange>It will be</transChange> fair weather, for the sky is red:</q>
Matthew 16:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and in the morning, <transChange>It will be</transChange> foul weather to-day, for the sky is red and lowring. <transChange>Ye</transChange> hypocrites, can ye distinguish the appearance of the sky, and not <transChange>discern</transChange> the signs of <transChange>these</transChange> times?</q>
Matthew 16:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>This</transChange> wicked and degenerate race demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, except that of the prophet Jonah.</q> And <transChange>so</transChange> He left them and went away.
Matthew 16:5 Now when his disciples departed to the other side, they forgot to take bread <transChange>with them:</transChange>
Matthew 16:6 and <transChange>therefore</transChange> when Jesus said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees,</q>
Matthew 16:7 they said one to another, <transChange>It is</transChange> because we have taken no bread.
Matthew 16:8 And Jesus knowing <transChange>their thoughts</transChange> said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O ye of little faith, why do ye argue among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</q>
Matthew 16:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves <transChange>divided</transChange> among five thousand, and how many baskets ye took <transChange>up?</transChange></q>
Matthew 16:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">nor the seven loaves among four thousand, and how many baskets-<transChange>full</transChange> ye took <transChange>away?</transChange></q>
Matthew 16:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">How is it <transChange>then</transChange> that ye do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, <transChange>when I bid you</transChange> to beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees?</q>
Matthew 16:12 Then they understood, that He did not bid them beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees.
Matthew 16:13 And when Jesus came into the parts of Cesarea Philippi, He asked his disciples, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am?</q>
Matthew 16:14 And they answered, Some <transChange>say thou art</transChange> John the Baptist, others Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
Matthew 16:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But,</q> saith He unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">whom do ye say that I am?</q>
Matthew 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God.
Matthew 16:17 And Jesus replied and said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas, for flesh and blood hath not revealed <transChange>it</transChange> unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.</q>
Matthew 16:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I also say unto thee, as thou art <transChange>called</transChange> Peter, so upon this rock, <transChange>which thou hast confessed,</transChange> will I build my church, and the gates of death shall not prevail against it.</q>
Matthew 16:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</q>
Matthew 16:20 Then charged He his disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Messiah.
Matthew 16:21 <transChange>And</transChange> from that time began Jesus to acquaint his disciples, that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many <transChange>things</transChange> from the elders, and chief priests, and scribes; and be put to death, and be raised again <transChange>on</transChange> the third day.
Matthew 16:22 Then Peter took Him and began to expostulate with Him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: may this never be unto thee.
Matthew 16:23 But He turned and said unto Peter, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence to me; for thou regardest not the things of God, but those <transChange>that be</transChange> of men.</q>
Matthew 16:24 Then said Jesus to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any one is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me:</q>
Matthew 16:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for he that would save his life shall lose it; but he that would lose his life for my sake shall find it.</q>
Matthew 16:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his <transChange>own</transChange> soul? or what shall a man give <transChange>as</transChange> a ransom for his soul?</q>

Matthew 17:1 And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up to a high mountain apart;
Matthew 17:2 and was transfigured before them: and his face shone like the sun, and his raiment became white as the light.
Matthew 17:3 And they saw Moses and Elias talking with Him.
Matthew 17:4 Then Peter said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou pleasest, let us make three tabernacles here, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
Matthew 17:5 <transChange>And</transChange> as he was speaking, lo a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.
Matthew 17:6 And when the disciples heard <transChange>it,</transChange> they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
Matthew 17:7 But Jesus came and touched them and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise up and be not afraid.</q>
Matthew 17:8 And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw none but Jesus only.
Matthew 17:9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Tell the vision to no one, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.</q>
Matthew 17:10 And his disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say, that Elias must first come?
Matthew 17:11 Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Elias doth indeed come first, and shall set all <transChange>things</transChange> right.</q>
Matthew 17:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But I tell you that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but did what they pleased to him: and so is the Son of man to suffer by them.</q>
Matthew 17:13 Then the disciples understood that He spake to them of John the baptist.
Matthew 17:14 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a man kneeling down and saying,
Matthew 17:15 Lord, have compassion upon my son, for he is lunatic and grievously afflicted; for he often falleth into the fire, and often into the water.
Matthew 17:16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heal him.
Matthew 17:17 Then Jesus answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?</q>
Matthew 17:18 Bring him here to me. And when Jesus rebuked him, the demon departed out of him, and the child was cured from that time.
Matthew 17:19 Then came the disciples to Jesus in private, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
Matthew 17:20 And Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">because of your unbelief: for verily I tell you, if ye had <transChange>but</transChange> faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this mountain, Remove from hence thither, and it shall remove: and nothing would be impossible to you.</q>
Matthew 17:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But this kind is not <transChange>to be</transChange> cast out but by prayer and fasting.</q>
Matthew 17:22 And while they were in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men:</q>
Matthew 17:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and they will put Him to death, and the third day He shall be raised <transChange>again.</transChange></q> And they were exceedingly grieved.
Matthew 17:24 And when they were come to Capernaum, the receivers of the tribute-<transChange>money</transChange> came to Peter and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? Yes, saith he.
Matthew 17:25 And when he came into the house, Jesus prevented him and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? Of their own children, or of other people?</q>
Matthew 17:26 Peter saith unto Him, Of others. Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then are the children free:</q>
Matthew 17:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but that we may not give them offence, go to the sea-<transChange>side</transChange> and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and open its mouth, and thou shalt find a piece of money: that take and give them for me and thee.</q> <chapter eID="gen574" osisID="Matt.17"/>
Matthew 18:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.18" sID="gen602"/>
Matthew 18:1 At that time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is <transChange>to be</transChange> the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Matthew 18:2 And Jesus calling to <transChange>Him</transChange> a little child, set it in the midst of them,
Matthew 18:3 and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I declare unto you, unless ye be converted, and become like little children, ye shall never enter into the kingdom of heaven.</q>
Matthew 18:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven:</q>

Matthew 18:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo <transChange>will be</transChange> to the world from <transChange>such</transChange> offenses; for it is <transChange>of</transChange> necessity that offenses come: but wo to that man by whom the offense cometh.</q>
Matthew 18:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If then thy hand or thy foot cause thee to offend, cut them off and cast <transChange>them</transChange> from <transChange>thee;</transChange> it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire:</q>
Matthew 18:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out and cast <transChange>it</transChange> from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with but one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.</q>
Matthew 18:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I tell you, that their angels in heaven do continually appear in the presence of my father, who is in heaven:</q>
Matthew 18:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for the Son of man came <transChange>from thence</transChange> to save that which was lost.</q>
Matthew 18:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">What think ye? if any man had an hundred sheep, and one of them should go astray, would he not leave the ninety and nine, and go upon the hills, and seek that which is gone astray?</q>
Matthew 18:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more on account of that, than of the ninety nine which went not astray.</q>
Matthew 18:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Even so it is not the will of your heavenly Father, that <transChange>any</transChange> one of these little ones should be lost.</q>
Matthew 18:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if thy brother trespass against thee, go and expostulate with him alone; if he hearken to thee, thou hast gained thy brother:</q>
Matthew 18:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but if he regard <transChange>thee</transChange> not, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</q>
Matthew 18:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if he disregard them, tell <transChange>it to</transChange> the church: but if he disregard the church too, let him be unto thee as an heathen and a publican.</q>

Matthew 19:1 And when Jesus had finished these discourses, He departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea, beyond Jordan:
Matthew 19:2 and great multitudes followed Him, and there He healed them.
Matthew 19:3 And the pharisees came to Him to ensnare Him, and asked Him, whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
Matthew 19:4 And He answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have ye not read, that He, who made <transChange>them</transChange> at first, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave <transChange>his</transChange> father and mother,</q>
Matthew 19:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh:</q>
Matthew 19:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. <transChange>And</transChange> therefore what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</q>
Matthew 19:7 They say unto Him, Why then did Moses order a bill of divorce to be given, and <transChange>so</transChange> to put her away?
Matthew 19:8 He answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Moses because of your hardheartedness, permitted you to put away your wives; but it was not so from the beginning:</q>
Matthew 19:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and I tell you, that whosoever putteth away his wife, except for whoredom, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and he that marrieth her <transChange>so</transChange> put away committeth adultery.</q>
Matthew 19:10 His disciples say unto Him, if the case of a man with his wife be thus, it is not adviseable to marry:
Matthew 19:11 but He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">All men cannot receive this saying <transChange>of yours,</transChange> but <transChange>those only</transChange> who have the gift <transChange>of continence:</transChange></q>
Matthew 19:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for there are <transChange>some</transChange> eunuchs, who were born so from their mother's womb; and there be some, who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that can receive <transChange>this saying,</transChange> let him receive <transChange>it.</transChange></q>
Matthew 19:13 Then were brought to Him little children, that He might put <transChange>his</transChange> hands upon them, and bless <transChange>them:</transChange> and the disciples rebuked them;
Matthew 19:14 but Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Suffer the children to come to me, and do not hinder them: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</q>
Matthew 19:15 And when He had laid <transChange>his</transChange> hands on them, he departed thence.
Matthew 19:16 And behold, there came one to Him, and said, Good master, what good shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Matthew 19:17 And He said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why callest thou me good? <transChange>there is</transChange> none good but one, <transChange>that is,</transChange> God: but if thou desirest to enter into life, keep the commandments.</q>
Matthew 19:18 He saith unto Him, Which? And Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou shalt do no murther, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother;</q>

Matthew 19:20 The young man saith unto Him, All these have I kept from my youth: wherein am I yet deficient?
Matthew 19:21 Jesus replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If thou wouldst be perfect, go, sell thy estate, and give <transChange>it</transChange> to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come <transChange>and</transChange> follow me.</q>
Matthew 19:22 But when the young man heard that, he went away sorrowful; for he had large possessions.
Matthew 19:23 Then said Jesus to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, that a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven:</q>
Matthew 19:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and again I tell you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</q>
Matthew 19:25 His disciples, when they heard <transChange>this,</transChange> were exceedingly struck, and said, Who then can be saved?
Matthew 19:26 But Jesus looking upon <transChange>them</transChange> said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">With men this is impossible, but with God all <transChange>things</transChange> are possible.</q>

Matthew 20:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take <transChange>what is</transChange> thine, and be gone: it is my pleasure to give to this last as <transChange>I do</transChange> to thee;</q>

Matthew 20:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Is thine eye evil because I am good? Thus the last shall be first, and the first last; for there are many called, but few chosen.</q>
Matthew 20:17 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem,
Matthew 20:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and the son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death,</q>
Matthew 20:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and deliver Him up to the gentiles, to insult, and to scourge, and to crucify <transChange>Him.</transChange> But on the third day He shall rise again.</q>
Matthew 20:20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him, together with her <transChange>two</transChange> sons, falling down before <transChange>Him,</transChange> and presenting a petition to Him.
Matthew 20:21 And He said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What dost thou desire?</q> She saith unto Him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdom.
Matthew 20:22 But Jesus answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye know not what ye ask: are ye able to drink of the cup which I am going to drink <transChange>of,</transChange> and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</q>
Matthew 20:23 They replied, We are able. And He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye shall indeed drink of my cup, and shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but <transChange>to those</transChange> for whom it is prepared by my Father.</q>
Matthew 20:24 And when the <transChange>other</transChange> ten heard <transChange>it,</transChange> they were provoked at the two brethren:
Matthew 20:25 but Jesus called them to <transChange>Him</transChange> and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye know that the princes of the gentiles lord it over them, and their great <transChange>men</transChange> exercise authority upon them:</q>
Matthew 20:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">it shall not be so among you; but whosoever would be great among you, let him be your minister, and whoever would be chief among you,</q>
Matthew 20:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">let him be your servant:</q>
Matthew 20:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">as the Son of man came not to be ministred unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.</q>
Matthew 20:29 And as they were going from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him:
Matthew 20:30 and behold, two blind men siting by the way-<transChange>side,</transChange> when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <transChange>thou</transChange> son of David.
Matthew 20:31 And the people rebuked them, that they might hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <transChange>thou</transChange> son of David.
Matthew 20:32 And Jesus stopt and called them, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What do ye desire me to do for you?</q>
Matthew 20:33 They answered Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Matthew 20:34 And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes; and straightway their eyes received sight, and they followed Him. <chapter eID="gen669" osisID="Matt.20"/>
Matthew 21:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.21" sID="gen704"/>
Matthew 21:1 And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage at the mount of Olives, Jesus sent two <transChange>of his</transChange> disciples,
Matthew 21:2 saying unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go into the village over-against you, and ye will find directly an ass tied and a colt with her: loose <transChange>them</transChange> and bring them to me:</q>
Matthew 21:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if any <transChange>one</transChange> say any <transChange>thing</transChange> to you, tell <transChange>him</transChange> the Lord hath need of them, and he will immediately send them.</q>
Matthew 21:4 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion,
Matthew 21:5 behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, even a colt the fole of an ass.
Matthew 21:6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus ordered them,
Matthew 21:7 and brought the ass and the colt, and threw their clothes over them, and set <transChange>Him</transChange> upon them.
Matthew 21:8 And great numbers spread their garments in the way, and others cut <transChange>off</transChange> boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way:
Matthew 21:9 and the multitudes, that went before and that followed, cried saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: blessed <transChange>be</transChange> He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
Matthew 21:10 And when He came into Jerusalem, all the city was in a commotion, saying, Who is this?
Matthew 21:11 And the people answered, This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.
Matthew 21:12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove out all that were selling and buying in <transChange>the court of</transChange> the temple, and threw down the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves:
Matthew 21:13 and said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is written, "My house shall be called the house of prayer," but ye have made it a den of thieves.</q>
Matthew 21:14 And there came to Him in the temple <transChange>both</transChange> blind and lame, and He healed them:
Matthew 21:15 but when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders that He wrought, and the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were vexed to the heart, and said to Him, Dost thou hear what these say?
Matthew 21:16 And Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Yes, have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast procured praise?</q>
Matthew 21:17 And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.
Matthew 21:18 Now in the morning as He was returning to the city, He was hungry;
Matthew 21:19 and seeing a fig-tree by the way, He went <transChange>up</transChange> to it, and finding nothing upon it but leaves, He saith to it, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let no fruit ever hereafter grow out of thee:</q> and the fig-tree withered immediately.
Matthew 21:20 And the disciples seeing <transChange>it</transChange> were amazed and said, How suddenly is the fig-tree withered!
Matthew 21:21 but Jesus answering said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, if ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only <transChange>be able to</transChange> do this to a fig-tree, but also if ye shall say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea," it shall be done.</q>
Matthew 21:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And all <transChange>things</transChange> whatsoever ye ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</q>
Matthew 21:23 And when He was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, By what authority dost thou these <transChange>things,</transChange> and who gave thee this authority?
Matthew 21:24 but Jesus answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I will likewise tell you by what authority I do these <transChange>things.</transChange></q>
Matthew 21:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves saying, If we say, from heaven, He will reply, Why then did ye not believe him?</q>
Matthew 21:26 But if we say, of men, we fear the people, for <transChange>they</transChange> all esteem John as a prophet.
Matthew 21:27 And <transChange>therefore</transChange> in answer to Jesus, they said, We do not know: and He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Neither do I tell you, by what authority I do these <transChange>things.</transChange></q>
Matthew 21:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But what think ye <transChange>of this</transChange>? <transChange>There was</transChange> a man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go, work to day in my vineyard:</q>
Matthew 21:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and he answered I will not; but afterwards repenting, he went.</q>
Matthew 21:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And coming to the second, he spake in like manner: and he answered, Yes, Sir; and went not.</q>
Matthew 21:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>Now</transChange> which of the two did the will of <transChange>his</transChange> father?</q> They say unto Him, The first. Jesus replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I say unto you, that publicans and prostitutes enter into the kingdom of God before you:</q>
Matthew 21:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye did not believe him; but publicans and harlots believed him; and though ye saw <transChange>that,</transChange> ye did not repent afterwards, to believe him.</q>
Matthew 21:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Hear another parable, There was a certain man, a master of a family, that planted a vineyard, and made a fence about it, and put a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and travelled abroad.</q>
Matthew 21:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when the fruit-season drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it:</q>
Matthew 21:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</q>
Matthew 21:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>And</transChange> he sent again other servants more than the first: and they did the like to them.</q>
Matthew 21:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">At last he sent unto them his Son, saying, They will reverence my Son.</q>
Matthew 21:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when the husbandmen saw the Son, they said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and seize on his inheritance:</q>
Matthew 21:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">so they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.</q>
Matthew 21:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?</q>
Matthew 21:41 They answer, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out the vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.
Matthew 21:42 <transChange>Then</transChange> saith Jesus to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Did ye never read in the scriptures, "The stone which the builders refused, is made the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"</q>
Matthew 21:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Therefore I tell you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation, that will bring forth the fruits thereof.</q>
Matthew 21:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he that stumbleth at this stone shall be bruised, but on whomsoever it falls, it will crush him to pieces.</q>
Matthew 21:45 And when the chief priests and pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that He spake of them:
Matthew 21:46 and would have seized Him, but that they were afraid of the people; because they took Him for a prophet. <chapter eID="gen704" osisID="Matt.21"/>
Matthew 22:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.22" sID="gen751"/>
Matthew 22:1 And Jesus resuming his discourse spake unto them again in parables,
Matthew 22:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding-<transChange>feast</transChange> for his son;</q>
Matthew 22:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and sent his servants to call those that were invited to the wedding: and they would not come.</q>
Matthew 22:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then he sent other servants, saying, Tell them that are invited, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all <transChange>things are</transChange> ready; come to the wedding.</q>
Matthew 22:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But they slighted <transChange>him,</transChange> and went away, one to his field and another to his merchandize:</q>
Matthew 22:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and others seized his servants, and shamefully abused <transChange>them,</transChange> and slew <transChange>them.</transChange></q>
Matthew 22:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when the king heard <transChange>of it,</transChange> he was <transChange>highly</transChange> provoked, and sent his troops, and destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.</q>
Matthew 22:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then saith he to his servants, The feast is ready, but they that were invited were not worthy <transChange>of it:</transChange></q>
Matthew 22:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">go therefore into the public streets, and as many as ye meet with invite to the wedding.</q>
Matthew 22:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And those servants went out into the <transChange>high</transChange>-ways, and brought in all they met with, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.</q>
Matthew 22:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man that had not put on a wedding-garment, and saith to him,</q>
Matthew 22:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Friend, how camest thou in here without a wedding-garment? and he was struck speechless.</q>
Matthew 22:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then said the king to his attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him up, and throw him out into the darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth:</q>
Matthew 22:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for there are many called, but few approved.</q>
Matthew 22:15 Then the pharisees went and consulted how they might insnare Him in <transChange>his</transChange> discourse.
Matthew 22:16 And they send to Him their disciples <transChange>along</transChange> with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art a man of truth, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men: Tell us therefore what thou thinkest,
Matthew 22:17 Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?
Matthew 22:18 But Jesus knew their malice, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why do ye tempt me, ye hypocrites?</q>
Matthew 22:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Shew me the tribute-money.</q> And they brought Him a <transChange>Roman</transChange> Penny.
Matthew 22:20 And He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whose image and inscription <transChange>is</transChange> this?</q>
Matthew 22:21 They answered, Cesar's. Then saith He unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Render therefore to Cesar the things that are Cesar's; and to God the things that are God's.</q>
Matthew 22:22 And when they heard <transChange>this,</transChange> they marvelled, and left Him and went away.
Matthew 22:23 On the same day came the sadducees to Him, who say there is no resurrection,
Matthew 22:24 and asked Him, saying, Master, Moses said, If any <transChange>man</transChange> die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.
Matthew 22:25 Now there were with us seven brothers, and the first married and died, and having no issue left his wife to his brother;
Matthew 22:26 likewise the second also, and the third, even to seven;
Matthew 22:27 and last of all the woman died also;
Matthew 22:28 therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Matthew 22:29 But Jesus answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye are mistaken, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God:</q>
Matthew 22:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God in heaven.</q>
Matthew 22:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what is spoken to you by God,</q>
Matthew 22:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</q>
Matthew 22:33 And when the people heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
Matthew 22:34 But when the pharisees heard that He had silenced the sadducees,
Matthew 22:35 they gathered together again, and one of them, an interpreter of the law, propounded a question, to try Him,
Matthew 22:36 and said, Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
Matthew 22:37 And Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind: this is the first and great command.</q>
Matthew 22:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And the second is like it,</q>
Matthew 22:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</q>
Matthew 22:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">On these two precepts depend all the law and the prophets.</q>
Matthew 22:41 Now while the pharisees were <transChange>thus</transChange> gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Matthew 22:42 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What think ye of the Messiah? whose son is He?</q> They say unto Him, David's.
Matthew 22:43 He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How then does David by inspiration call Him Lord,</q>
Matthew 22:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, "Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"</q>
Matthew 22:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">therefore if David call Him Lord, how is He his son?</q>
Matthew 22:46 And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did any dare, from that day, to ask Him any more <transChange>such questions.</transChange> <chapter eID="gen751" osisID="Matt.22"/>
Matthew 23:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.23" sID="gen798"/>
Matthew 23:1 Then spake Jesus to the people and to his disciples, saying,
Matthew 23:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The scribes and pharisees sit in the seat of Moses:</q>
Matthew 23:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">observe therefore and do all <transChange>things</transChange> whatsoever they tell you to observe; but do not ye according to their works, for they say and do not:</q>
Matthew 23:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for they bind grievous and intolerable burthens, and impose them upon men; but they <transChange>themselves</transChange> will not put a finger to them:</q>
Matthew 23:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but they do all their works to be seen by men; they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge the fringes of their garments,</q>
Matthew 23:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and love the uppermost places at feasts,</q>
Matthew 23:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and the chief seats in the synagogues, and salutations in public assemblies, and to be called by men Rabbi, Rabbi.</q>
Matthew 23:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your instructor <transChange>even</transChange> Christ, and ye are all brethren.</q>
Matthew 23:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Neither call <transChange>any man</transChange> upon earth Father; for one is your Father, <transChange>who is</transChange> in heaven:</q>
Matthew 23:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">neither be ye called masters; for one is your master, even Christ.</q>
Matthew 23:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But let him that is greatest among you be your minister: and whosoever will exalt himself shall be abased,</q>
Matthew 23:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and whosoever will humble himself shall be exalted.</q>
Matthew 23:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites, who shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, nor suffer those that are entering to go in.</q>
Matthew 23:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye devour widows houses, and for a cover make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive the heavier judgement.</q>
Matthew 23:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites: for ye compass sea and land to make a proselyte, and when he is gained, ye make him more the child of hell than yourselves.</q>
Matthew 23:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo unto you, <transChange>ye</transChange> blind guides, who say, If any <transChange>one</transChange> swear by the temple, it is nothing;</q>

Matthew 23:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!</q>

Matthew 24:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And unless those days be shortened, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days shall be shortened.</q>
Matthew 24:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then if any shall say to you, Behold here is the Messiah, or there; believe <transChange>it</transChange> not:</q>

Matthew 25:1 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then will the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom: and five of them were wise,</q>
Matthew 25:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and five <transChange>were</transChange> foolish.</q>
Matthew 25:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The foolish <transChange>ones</transChange> took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</q>
Matthew 25:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but the wise took oil in their vessels as well as in their lamps.</q>
Matthew 25:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now while the bridegroom stayed, they were all drowsy and fell asleep:</q>
Matthew 25:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and in the middle of the night there was a cry, The bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him.</q>
Matthew 25:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then all the virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps:</q>
Matthew 25:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and the foolish <transChange>ones</transChange> said to the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out:</q>
Matthew 25:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but the wise answered <transChange>them,</transChange> saying, Least there should not be enough for us and you, go rather to them that sell <transChange>it,</transChange> and buy for yourselves.</q>
Matthew 25:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the wedding-<transChange>feast,</transChange> and <transChange>then</transChange> the door was shut.</q>
Matthew 25:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us:</q>
Matthew 25:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but he answered <transChange>them</transChange>, Verily I declare unto you, I do not know you.</q>
Matthew 25:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Watch therefore, for ye know not the day, nor the season in which the Son of man cometh.</q>
Matthew 25:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For as a man, <transChange>who was</transChange> going to travel abroad, called his servants, and delivered to them his stock: and to one he gave five talents,</q>
Matthew 25:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">to another two, and to another one; to each according to his ability: and then he took his journey.</q>
Matthew 25:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now he that had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and gained other five talents:</q>
Matthew 25:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and likewise he that had the two, he also gained two more:</q>
Matthew 25:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but he who had received the one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his master's money:</q>
Matthew 25:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and after some time the lord of those servants cometh and settleth <transChange>his</transChange> account with them.</q>
Matthew 25:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he who had received the five talents came and brought to <transChange>him</transChange> five talents more, saying, Sir, thou deliveredst to me five talents, behold I have gained other five talents to them:</q>

Matthew 25:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he also who had received the two talents came to <transChange>him</transChange> and said, Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents, behold I have gained two other talents with them:</q>
Matthew 25:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">his lord said to him, Well <transChange>done,</transChange> good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful in a few <transChange>things,</transChange> I will set thee over many, enter into the joy of thy lord.</q>
Matthew 25:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he also who received the one talent came to <transChange>him</transChange> and said, Sir, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou hast not strewed;</q>
Matthew 25:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the ground; behold, there is thine <transChange>own:</transChange></q>
Matthew 25:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but his lord answered and said to him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed;</q>

Matthew 25:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then will the righteous answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed <transChange>thee?</transChange> or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</q>

Matthew 26:1 And when Jesus had finished these discourses, He said to his disciples,
Matthew 26:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye know that after two days the passover is <transChange>to be kept,</transChange>---and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</q>
Matthew 26:3 <transChange>Now</transChange> the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people were then assembled together into the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas:
Matthew 26:4 and were consulting how they might take Jesus by treachery and put Him to death.
Matthew 26:5 But they said, Not on the feast-day, least there should be a tumult among the people.
Matthew 26:6 And when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew 26:7 there came to Him a woman with an alabaster-<transChange>box</transChange> of very precious ointment, and poured <transChange>it</transChange> on his head as He was at table:
Matthew 26:8 but when his disciples saw <transChange>it,</transChange> they were <transChange>some of them</transChange> provoked <transChange>at it,</transChange> and said, Wherefore <transChange>is</transChange> this waste?
Matthew 26:9 for this ointment might have been sold for a great deal <transChange>of money,</transChange> and given to the poor.
Matthew 26:10 But Jesus, knowing <transChange>what passed,</transChange> said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why do ye give the woman uneasiness? for she has done a good office to me:</q>
Matthew 26:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">(seeing ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always:) for <transChange>in</transChange> pouring this ointment on my body,</q>
Matthew 26:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">she has embalmed me for my burial.</q>
Matthew 26:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached, in the whole world, what she hath done shall also be spoken of for a memorial of her.</q>
Matthew 26:14 About this time went one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot,
Matthew 26:15 to the chief priests, and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him to you? and they promised him thirty pieces of silver:
Matthew 26:16 and from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.
Matthew 26:17 Now upon the first <transChange>day of the feast</transChange> of unleavened bread, came the disciples to Jesus, saying, where wouldest thou have us make preparation for thee to eat the passover?
Matthew 26:18 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go into the city, to such a man, and tell him, The master saith, my time is near, I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples:</q> and the disciples did as Jesus ordered them,
Matthew 26:19 and prepared the passover.
Matthew 26:20 And when the evening was come, He sat down with the twelve:
Matthew 26:21 and as they were eating, He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me.</q>
Matthew 26:22 And they were exceedingly grieved, and said to Him, every one of them, Lord, is it I?
Matthew 26:23 and He answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, <transChange>even</transChange> he will betray me.</q>
Matthew 26:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The Son of man is going indeed as it is written concerning Him: but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for him, if that man had never been born.</q>
Matthew 26:25 And Judas, who betrayed Him, answered and said, Master, is it I? <transChange>and</transChange> He said unto him, <hi type="italic">It is</hi>.
Matthew 26:26 Now as they were at table, Jesus took bread, and blessed <transChange>it,</transChange> and brake <transChange>it,</transChange> and gave <transChange>it</transChange> to the disciples, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take, eat; this is my body:</q>
Matthew 26:27 and He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <transChange>it</transChange> to them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Drink ye all of it:</q>
Matthew 26:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for this is my blood, <transChange>the blood</transChange> of the new covenant, which is <transChange>to be</transChange> shed for many for the remission of sins:</q>
Matthew 26:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I tell you, that from henceforth I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.</q>
Matthew 26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
Matthew 26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye will all take offence at me this night; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered:"</q>
Matthew 26:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but after I am risen <transChange>again,</transChange> I will go before you into Galilee.</q>
Matthew 26:33 But Peter answered and said to Him, though they should all be offended in thee, <transChange>yet</transChange> will I never be offended.
Matthew 26:34 Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell thee that this night, before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</q>
Matthew 26:35 Peter replied, though I should die with thee, <transChange>yet</transChange> will I not deny thee. And <transChange>so</transChange> likewise said all the disciples.
Matthew 26:36 Then went Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Sit here, while I go there and pray:</q>
Matthew 26:37 and having taken with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and much distressed;
Matthew 26:38 and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, stay here and watch with me.</q>
Matthew 26:39 And going a little farther, He prostrated himself, and prayed, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou <transChange>wilt.</transChange></q>
Matthew 26:40 And coming to the disciples, he findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, <q marker="" who="Jesus">what! could ye not watch with me one hour?</q>
Matthew 26:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q>
Matthew 26:42 <transChange>And</transChange> going away again, the second time He prayed, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.</q>
Matthew 26:43 And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew 26:44 And He left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, <transChange>to</transChange> the same effect.
Matthew 26:45 Then He cometh to his disciples and saith, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Are ye sleeping still and taking your rest? behold, the hour is come, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</q>
Matthew 26:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise, let us go, see the traitor is at hand.</q>
Matthew 26:47 And while He was yet speaking, behold, Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great number, with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people:
Matthew 26:48 (now he that betrayed Him, had given them a signal, saying, <transChange>The man</transChange> whom I shall kiss is He, lay hold of Him:)
Matthew 26:49 and going directly up to Jesus, he said, Hail master, and kissed Him.
Matthew 26:50 And Jesus said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</q> then they came up and laid hands on Jesus, and apprehended Him.
Matthew 26:51 And one of them <transChange>that were</transChange> with Jesus, stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking at the high priest's servant took off his ear.
Matthew 26:52 Then said Jesus to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Put up thy sword into it's place; for they that take the sword shall perish by the sword:</q>
Matthew 26:53 <q marker="" who="Jesus">dost thou think that I cannot now apply to my Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels?</q>
Matthew 26:54 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>but</transChange> how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, <transChange>which say</transChange> that thus it must be?</q>
Matthew 26:55 Then said Jesus to the multitudes, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye are come out as against a thief with swords and clubs to take me, <transChange>whereas</transChange> I sat with you day after day teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me: but all this is done,</q>
Matthew 26:56 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</q>
Matthew 26:57 Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled. And they, that apprehended Jesus, led <transChange>Him</transChange> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled:
Matthew 26:58 and Peter followed Him at a distance, to the high-priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, that he might see the issue.
Matthew 26:59 Now the chief priests and elders, and the whole council sought false-witness against Jesus, that they might put Him to death: but found none.
Matthew 26:60 And tho' many false witnesses came, they found none <transChange>to their purpose.</transChange> But at last came two false witnesses and said,
Matthew 26:61 This <transChange>fellow</transChange> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
Matthew 26:62 And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Dost thou make no answer? what do these <transChange>men</transChange> testify against thee? but Jesus made no reply.
Matthew 26:63 Then the high priest said to Him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
Matthew 26:64 Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>It is as</transChange> thou hast said: and I tell you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</q>
Matthew 26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy, what need have we more of witnesses? now ye have heard his blasphemy, what think ye?
Matthew 26:66 and they answered, He ought to be put to death.
Matthew 26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and beat Him about the head; and some struck Him with rods,
Matthew 26:68 saying, Divine to us, <transChange>thou</transChange> Christ, who it is that smote thee.
Matthew 26:69 Now Peter was sitting without in the hall, and one of the maids came to him and said, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee:
Matthew 26:70 but he denied <transChange>it</transChange> before <transChange>them</transChange> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
Matthew 26:71 And he went out into the porch; <transChange>after which</transChange> another <transChange>maid</transChange> saw him, and said to them <transChange>that were</transChange> there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth:
Matthew 26:72 and he denied a second time, <transChange>and that</transChange> with an oath, <transChange>saying,</transChange> I know not the man. And a little after, they that stood <transChange>by</transChange> came to Peter and said,
Matthew 26:73 Verily thou also art <transChange>one</transChange> of them, for thy speech discovers thee:
Matthew 26:74 then he began to curse and to swear, <transChange>saying,</transChange> I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
Matthew 26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</q> And he went out, and wept bitterly. <chapter eID="gen937" osisID="Matt.26"/>
Matthew 27:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.27" sID="gen1013"/>
Matthew 27:1 And as soon as it was morning all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, how to get Him executed:
Matthew 27:2 so they bound Him and led <transChange>Him</transChange> away, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the <transChange>Roman</transChange> governor.
Matthew 27:3 Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, when he saw that He was condemned, being struck with remorse, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
Matthew 27:4 saying, I have sinned, for I have betrayed innocent blood: but they said, What <transChange>is that</transChange> to us? see thou <transChange>to that.</transChange>
Matthew 27:5 And he threw <transChange>down</transChange> the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
Matthew 27:6 But the chief priests took <transChange>up</transChange> the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury <transChange>of the temple,</transChange> because it is the price of blood:
Matthew 27:7 so they consulted together, and bought with them the potter's field for a burying-<transChange>ground</transChange> for strangers:
Matthew 27:8 and therefore that field is called the field of blood to this day.
Matthew 27:9 Then was fulfilled <transChange>that</transChange> which was spoken by the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was estimated, on whom the children of Israel set the price,
Matthew 27:10 and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
Matthew 27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>It is as</transChange> thou sayest.</q>
Matthew 27:12 And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
Matthew 27:13 Then saith Pilate to Him, Dost thou not hear how many <transChange>things</transChange> they witness against thee?
Matthew 27:14 but He answered him not one word: so that the governor was much astonished.
Matthew 27:15 Now the governor used at the feast to release a prisoner to the people, whom<transChange>soever</transChange> they desired:
Matthew 27:16 and they had then a notorious malefactor named Barabbas.
Matthew 27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye <transChange>that</transChange> I release unto you?
Matthew 27:18 Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ? for he knew that out of envy they had delivered Him up.
Matthew 27:19 (And while he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous <transChange>man:</transChange> for I have suffered much in a dream to day on his account.)
Matthew 27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the <transChange>common</transChange> people to ask for Barabbas, and <transChange>so</transChange> to destroy Jesus.
Matthew 27:21 And the governor said to them, Which of the two would you have me release to you? and they said, Barabbas.
Matthew 27:22 What shall I do then, saith Pilate, with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all cried out, Let Him be crucified.
Matthew 27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath He done? but they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified.
Matthew 27:24 Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man, look ye to <transChange>it:</transChange>
Matthew 27:25 and all the people answered and said, His blood <transChange>be</transChange> on us, and on our children.
Matthew 27:26 Then he released to them Barabbas: but he ordered Jesus to be scourged, and delivered <transChange>Him</transChange> to be crucified.
Matthew 27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the hall, and gathered the whole band about Him:
Matthew 27:28 and when they had stript Him, they covered Him with a scarlet robe;
Matthew 27:29 and having platted a crown of thorns, they put <transChange>it</transChange> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they bowed the knee before Him in derision, saying, Hail king of the Jews:
Matthew 27:30 and they spit upon Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head.
Matthew 27:31 And after they had <transChange>thus</transChange> abused Him, they took off the <transChange>scarlet</transChange> robe from Him, and put on Him his own clothes, and led Him away to be crucified.
Matthew 27:32 And as they were going along they met with a man of Cyrene, whose name was Simon; and forced him to carry the cross.
Matthew 27:33 And when they were come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say,
Matthew 27:34 the place of a skull, they gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: but when He had tasted it, He would not drink.
Matthew 27:35 And after they had fixed Him to the cross, they parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
Matthew 27:36 And they sat down and watched Him there: and put up over his head his accusation in writing,
Matthew 27:37 THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew 27:38 And there were two thieves crucified with Him: one on his right hand, and one on the left.
Matthew 27:39 And they that passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads,
Matthew 27:40 and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <transChange>it again</transChange> in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Matthew 27:41 And in like manner the chief priests also insulting Him, with the scribes and elders,
Matthew 27:42 said, He saved others, himself He cannot save: if He be the king of Israel, let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe Him:
Matthew 27:43 He trusted in God, let Him deliver Him now, if He will <transChange>own</transChange> Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.
Matthew 27:44 And <transChange>one of</transChange> the thieves also, that were crucified with Him, cast the same reproach upon Him.
Matthew 27:45 Now from the sixth hour to the ninth there was darkness over all the land.
Matthew 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,"</q> that is <transChange>to say,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</q>
Matthew 27:47 And some of them that stood by, hearing Him, said, He calls upon Elias:
Matthew 27:48 and immediately one of them ran, and took a spunge, and having filled <transChange>it</transChange> with vinegar put <transChange>it</transChange> upon a reed, and offered <transChange>it</transChange> Him to drink;
Matthew 27:49 the rest said, Stay, let us see whether Elias will come and save Him.
Matthew 27:50 But Jesus cried out again with a loud voice; and <transChange>then</transChange> gave up the ghost.
Matthew 27:51 And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split:
Matthew 27:52 and the graves opened, and many bodies of departed saints arose,
Matthew 27:53 and coming out of the graves, after his resurrection, went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
Matthew 27:54 And when the centurion, and they that were with him guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake, and what was done, they were sore afraid, and said, This was indeed the Son of God.
Matthew 27:55 And several women were there looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministring unto Him:
Matthew 27:56 among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
Matthew 27:57 And in the evening, there came a rich man of Arimathea, whose name was Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus, <transChange>and</transChange> went to Pilate,
Matthew 27:58 and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be delivered <transChange>to him;</transChange>
Matthew 27:59 and Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew 27:60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had <transChange>had</transChange> cut out in the rock; and when he had rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, he went away:
Matthew 27:61 but there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.
Matthew 27:62 Now the next day after the preparation, the chief priests and pharisees went together to Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that this impostor,
Matthew 27:63 when He was alive, said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">After three days I <transChange>will</transChange> rise <transChange>again:</transChange></q>
Matthew 27:64 order therefore the sepulchre to be secured till the third day, least his disciples should come and steal Him away, and tell the people, He is risen from the dead: and <transChange>so</transChange> the last error will be worse than the first.
Matthew 27:65 But Pilate said to them, Ye have a guard <transChange>of your own,</transChange> go <transChange>and</transChange> make it as secure as ye will.
Matthew 27:66 So they went and made the sepulchre safe, sealing the stone, and setting a guard <transChange>to watch it.</transChange> <chapter eID="gen1013" osisID="Matt.27"/>
Matthew 28:0 <chapter osisID="Matt.28" sID="gen1080"/>
Matthew 28:1 Now after the sabbath, in the dawning towards the first <transChange>day</transChange> of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to look at the sepulchre:
Matthew 28:2 and behold, there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven, had come and rolled away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it:
Matthew 28:3 (and his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Matthew 28:4 and the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men:)
Matthew 28:5 and the angel said to the women, Be not ye afraid: for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified.
Matthew 28:6 He is not here, for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay:
Matthew 28:7 and go quickly, and tell his disciples that He is risen from the dead; and behold, He is going before you into Galilee; there ye shall see Him; lo, I have told you.
Matthew 28:8 And they went immediately from the sepulchre, with fear, and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Matthew 28:9 And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">God save you.</q> And they drew near and embraced his feet, and worshipped Him.
Matthew 28:10 Then saith Jesus unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be not afraid, go tell my brethren to repair into Galilee, and there they shall see me.</q>
Matthew 28:11 Now while they were going, behold some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all that had happened:
Matthew 28:12 and they assembled with the elders, and taking counsel <transChange>together</transChange> gave the soldiers <transChange>a</transChange> large <transChange>sum</transChange> of money,
Matthew 28:13 saying, Do you say, that his disciples came by night, and stole Him <transChange>away,</transChange> while we were asleep.
Matthew 28:14 And if this should come to a hearing before the governor, we will satisfy him, and indemnify you.
Matthew 28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.
Matthew 28:16 And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
Matthew 28:17 And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him: but some doubted.
Matthew 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">All power is given unto me <transChange>both</transChange> in heaven and on earth.</q>
Matthew 28:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go ye therefore and instruct all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,</q>
Matthew 28:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and of the holy Ghost, <transChange>and</transChange> teaching them to observe all <transChange>things</transChange> whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

Mark 1:1 <hi type="bold">The</hi> beginning of the gospel of JESUS CHRIST the Son of GOD.
Mark 1:2 As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee:"
Mark 1:3 <transChange>and again,</transChange> "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight:" <transChange>accordingly</transChange> John came baptizing in the wilderness,
Mark 1:4 and preaching the baptism of repentance in order to the remission of sins;
Mark 1:5 and all the country of Judea, and those of Jerusalem, went out to him, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Mark 1:6 And John was clothed with camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and he lived upon locusts and wild honey: and he preached,
Mark 1:7 saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop and unloose.
Mark 1:8 I indeed have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the holy Spirit.
Mark 1:9 And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan:
Mark 1:10 and as soon as He came up from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.
Mark 1:11 And there was a voice from heaven, <transChange>saying,</transChange> This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Mark 1:12 And immediately the Spirit taketh Him out into the wilderness:
Mark 1:13 and He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts: and angels ministred unto Him.
Mark 1:14 Now after John was cast into prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
Mark 1:15 and saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.</q>
Mark 1:16 And as He was walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea,
Mark 1:17 (for they were fishermen,) and Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men:</q>
Mark 1:18 and immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
Mark 1:19 And going a little farther, He saw James <transChange>the son</transChange> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship, mending their nets, and immediately called them <transChange>likewise:</transChange>
Mark 1:20 and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the men he had hired, and went along with Him.
Mark 1:21 And they went into Capernaum: and going directly into the synagogue on the sabbath, He taught <transChange>the people:</transChange> and they were astonished at his doctrine;
Mark 1:22 for He taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark 1:23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an impure spirit,
Mark 1:24 and he cried out, saying, Let <transChange>us</transChange> alone, what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, the holy <transChange>one</transChange> of God.
Mark 1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be silent, and come out of him:</q> and the impure spirit threw him into convulsions,
Mark 1:26 and roaring with a loud voice, came out of him.
Mark 1:27 And they were all amazed, so that they inquired of each other, saying, What is this, what new <transChange>kind of</transChange> doctrine <transChange>is</transChange> this? for He commands with authority even the impure spirits, and they obey Him.
Mark 1:28 And straitway his fame spread into all the country <transChange>round</transChange> about Galilee.
Mark 1:29 And as soon as they came out of the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, <transChange>together</transChange> with James and John.
Mark 1:30 And Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever: and they immediately told Him of her:
Mark 1:31 and He came to <transChange>her,</transChange> and taking her by the hand raised her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she waited upon them.
Mark 1:32 And in the evening, when the sun set, they brought to Him all that were ill, and demoniacs:
Mark 1:33 and the whole city was gathered together at the door;
Mark 1:34 and He healed many that were ill of various diseases, and cast out many devils, and suffered not the devils to say that they knew Him.
Mark 1:35 And in the morning, before it was light, He rose up and went out, and retired into a solitary place, and there prayed.
Mark 1:36 And Simon, and they <transChange>that were</transChange> with him, went in quest of Him:
Mark 1:37 and when they found Him, they said to Him, all <transChange>the people</transChange> are seeking for thee.
Mark 1:38 And He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let us go into the neighbouring towns, that I may preach there also; for this was the end of my coming.</q>
Mark 1:39 And He went preaching in their synagogues, through all Galilee, and casting out devils.
Mark 1:40 And there came to Him a leper, beseeching Him, and kneeling down to Him, and saying unto Him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me:
Mark 1:41 and Jesus, being moved with compassion, stretched out <transChange>his</transChange> hand and touched him, and saith unto Him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I will;</q>
Mark 1:42 be thou healed: and as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was healed.
Mark 1:43 And he gave him a strict charge, and immediately dismissed him,
Mark 1:44 and saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">See thou tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy purification what Moses has commanded, for a testimony to them.</q>
Mark 1:45 But when he was gone he began to publish <transChange>it</transChange> much, and to spread abroad the report: so that Jesus could no more go openly into the city, but kept out in country places: and they came to Him from all parts. <chapter eID="gen1102" osisID="Mark.1"/>
Mark 2:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.2" sID="gen1148"/>
Mark 2:1 And after <transChange>some</transChange> days He went again into Capernaum; and it being heard that He was in the house,
Mark 2:2 great numbers were immediately gathered together, so that there was no more room to contain them, not even about the door: and as he was preaching the word unto them,
Mark 2:3 there came <transChange>some</transChange> to Him, bringing a paralytic <transChange>who was</transChange> carried by four <transChange>men:</transChange>
Mark 2:4 and not being able to come near to Him for the croud, they uncovered the roof where He was, and when they had made an openning, they let down the couch on which the paralytic was laid.
Mark 2:5 And Jesus, seeing their faith, saith to him that had the palsy, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</q>
Mark 2:6 But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark 2:7 Why doth this <transChange>man</transChange> thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God?
Mark 2:8 And Jesus, who knew immediately in his spirit that they were thus reasoning within themselves, said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why do ye dispute these <transChange>things</transChange> in your hearts?</q>
Mark 2:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Rise, take up thy couch, and walk?</q>
Mark 2:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But that ye may know, that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,</q>
Mark 2:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I say unto thee (saith He to the paralytic,) Arise, and take up thy couch, and go thy way to thine own house.</q>
Mark 2:12 And he instantly arose, and taking up his couch, went out before <transChange>them</transChange> all, so that <transChange>they</transChange> were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, we never saw the like.
Mark 2:13 And He went out again towards the sea-<transChange>side,</transChange> and all the people resorted to Him, and He taught them.
Mark 2:14 And as He went along, He saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the <transChange>receit of</transChange> custom, and saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Follow me:</q> and he rose up and followed Him.
Mark 2:15 And as He sat at table in his house, many publicans and sinners also sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed Him.
Mark 2:16 And the scribes and pharisees, when they saw Him eating with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, What <transChange>is the meaning</transChange> that He eateth with publicans and sinners?
Mark 2:17 <transChange>Which</transChange> Jesus hearing, saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">They that are in health have no need of a physician, but they that are ill: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.</q>
Mark 2:18 And as the disciples of John, and of the pharisees used to fast, they came to Him, saying, Why do the disciples of John and of the pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Mark 2:19 And Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Can the bridemen fast, when the bridegroom is with them? while the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast:</q>
Mark 2:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them; and then shall they fast.</q>
Mark 2:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">No man seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; otherwise, it's new patch teareth from the old, and the rent is made worse:</q>
Mark 2:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">nor does any one put new wine into old vessels; otherwise the new wine bursteth the vessels, and the wine is spilt, and the vessels are destroyed: but new wine should be put into new vessels.</q>
Mark 2:23 And as He was going thro' the corn-<transChange>fields</transChange> on the sabbath-<transChange>day,</transChange> his disciples began as they went along to pluck the ears of corn.
Mark 2:24 And the pharisees said to Him, See, why do they what is not lawful <transChange>to be done</transChange> on the sabbath-day?
Mark 2:25 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have ye never read what David did, in his necessity, when he was hungry, himself and those <transChange>that were</transChange> with him?</q>
Mark 2:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar, <transChange>who was afterwards</transChange> the high priest, and did eat the shew-bread, which it is not lawful <transChange>for any</transChange> to eat, but the priests, and gave also to them that were with him!</q>
Mark 2:27 And He said <transChange>moreover</transChange> unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath:</q>
Mark 2:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>and</transChange> therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.</q> <chapter eID="gen1148" osisID="Mark.2"/>
Mark 3:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.3" sID="gen1177"/>
Mark 3:1 And He went another time into a synagogue, where there was a man that had a withered hand:
Mark 3:2 and they watched Him, whether He would heal him on the sabbath-day, that they might accuse Him.
Mark 3:3 And He said to the man, that had the withered hand, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise up into the midst:</q>
Mark 3:4 then saith He to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?</q> but they were silent.
Mark 3:5 And when He had looked round upon them with indignation, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He saith to the man, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Stretch out thine hand:</q> and he stretched <transChange>it</transChange> out, and his hand was made <transChange>as</transChange> sound as the other.
Mark 3:6 And the pharisees went out, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how to destroy Him:
Mark 3:7 but Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea.
Mark 3:8 And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and <transChange>from</transChange> beyond Jordan; and those about Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing how great <transChange>things</transChange> He did, came unto Him.
Mark 3:9 Therefore He spake to his disciples, that there might be a small vessel attending Him, because of the multitude, least they should throng Him: for He <transChange>had</transChange> healed many,
Mark 3:10 so that whoever had <transChange>any</transChange> maladies, crouded upon Him to touch Him.
Mark 3:11 And impure spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him, and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God:
Mark 3:12 but He strictly charged them not to make Him known.
Mark 3:13 Then going up into a mountain, He calleth for such as He saw fit, and they came to Him:
Mark 3:14 and He appointed twelve to be with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach <transChange>the gospel,</transChange>
Mark 3:15 and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons;
Mark 3:16 even Simon, <transChange>whom</transChange> He surnamed Peter,
Mark 3:17 and James the Son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, (and He surnamed them Boanerges, which is <transChange>to say,</transChange> Sons of thunder,) and Andrew,
Mark 3:18 and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James <transChange>the son</transChange> of Alpheus, and Thaddeus,
Mark 3:19 and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, even <transChange>him</transChange> who betrayed Him.
Mark 3:20 And they went into a house, and the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat.
Mark 3:21 And when his friends heard <transChange>of it,</transChange> they went out to lay hold on Him; for they said He spends Himself too much.
Mark 3:22 And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He is in league with Beelzebub, and casts out demons by <transChange>the help of</transChange> the prince of demons.
Mark 3:23 So He called them to <transChange>Him,</transChange> and said unto them in parables, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How can Satan cast out Satan?</q>
Mark 3:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand:</q>
Mark 3:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if a family be divided against itself, that family cannot stand: and if Satan oppose himself and be divided,</q>
Mark 3:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">he cannot stand, but <transChange>his kingdom</transChange> is at an end.</q>
Mark 3:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">No one can enter into the house of a strong <transChange>man,</transChange> and plunder his goods; unless he first bind the strong <transChange>man,</transChange> and then he may pillage his house.</q>
Mark 3:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith they may blaspheme:</q>
Mark 3:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but whosoever blasphemeth against the holy Ghost never hath forgiveness, but is liable to eternal damnation:</q>
Mark 3:30 for they said, He hath an impure spirit.
Mark 3:31 So his brethren and his mother came, and standing without sent to Him to call Him <transChange>to them:</transChange>
Mark 3:32 and there was a multitude sitting about Him, and they said to Him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are without inquiring for thee.
Mark 3:33 And He answered them, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Who is my mother, or my brethren?</q>
Mark 3:34 And looking round on those that sat about Him, He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold my mother, and my brethren:</q>
Mark 3:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for whosoever doth the will of God, he is <transChange>to me as</transChange> my brother, my sister, and mother.</q> <chapter eID="gen1177" osisID="Mark.3"/>

Mark 4:1 And He began to teach again by the sea-side, and there was gathered unto Him a great multitude; so that He went into a ship, and sat on board, and all the people were by the sea, upon the shore.
Mark 4:2 And He taught them many things by similitudes, and said to them in his instruction,
Mark 4:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">hearken, Behold a sower went out to sow:</q>
Mark 4:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and in sowing, some fell by the way-<transChange>side,</transChange> and the birds came and ate it up:</q>
Mark 4:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth, and it sprang up immediately, because it had not depth of earth;</q>
Mark 4:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but when the sun rose, it was burnt up, and withered because it had no root:</q>
Mark 4:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit:</q>
Mark 4:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit springing up and increasing; and produced some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred-<transChange>fold.</transChange></q>
Mark 4:9 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</q>
Mark 4:10 And when He was apart <transChange>from the multitude,</transChange> those that were about Him with the twelve asked Him concerning the parable.
Mark 4:11 And he said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">To you it is granted to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without all things are <transChange>delivered</transChange> in parables:</q>
Mark 4:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that <transChange>in</transChange> seeing they may see and not perceive, and <transChange>in</transChange> hearing they may hear and not understand, least they should be converted, and <transChange>their</transChange> sins be forgiven them.</q>
Mark 4:13 Then saith He unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye not understand this parable? how then will ye understand all <transChange>my other</transChange> parables.</q>
Mark 4:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The sower <transChange>is he that</transChange> soweth the word. And these are they by the way-<transChange>side:</transChange></q>
Mark 4:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">where the word is sown; but when they have heard <transChange>it,</transChange> Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word <transChange>that was</transChange> sown in their hearts.</q>
Mark 4:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And in like manner, they that are sown <transChange>as</transChange> on stony grounds are such, as when they hear the word,</q>
Mark 4:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">immediately receive it with joy, but have no root in themselves, <transChange>and so</transChange> continue but for a <transChange>short</transChange> season: <transChange>and</transChange> then, when affliction cometh, or persecution on account of the word, they are <transChange>as</transChange> soon offended.</q>
Mark 4:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And those that are sown <transChange>as</transChange> among thorns, are these: such as hear the word <transChange>indeed,</transChange></q>
Mark 4:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and <transChange>inordinate</transChange> desires after other things entering in choke the word, and <transChange>so</transChange> it becometh unfruitful.</q>
Mark 4:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And these are they who are <transChange>like seed</transChange> sown on good ground: such as hear the word, and receive <transChange>it;</transChange> and bring forth fruit, some thirty-<transChange>fold,</transChange> and some sixty, and some an hundred.</q>
Mark 4:21 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or a bed, <transChange>and</transChange> not to be set on a candlestick?</q>
Mark 4:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for there is nothing hidden, which may not be revealed; nor was there any thing concealed, but in order to become manifest.</q>
Mark 4:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.</q>
Mark 4:24 And mind what ye hear: <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>for</transChange> with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and more shall be imparted to you that are observant:</q>
Mark 4:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for whosoever hath, to him <transChange>more</transChange> shall be given; and he that hath not, even what he hath, <transChange>or seemeth to have,</transChange> shall be taken from him.</q>
Mark 4:26 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed into the ground,</q>
Mark 4:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up, and increase; he knows not how.</q>
Mark 4:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For the earth produces fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear:</q>
Mark 4:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but when the fruit is ripe, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</q>
Mark 4:30 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or by what similitude shall we represent it?</q>
Mark 4:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>It is</transChange> like to a grain of mustard-seed, which when it is sown in the ground, is one of the lest of all the seeds on the earth:</q>
Mark 4:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but after it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the air may lodge under it's shadow.</q>
Mark 4:33 And in many such parables spake He the word to them, as they had ability to hear <transChange>it:</transChange> but spake not to them without a parable.
Mark 4:34 And He explained all to his disciples in private.
Mark 4:35 And the same day, in the evening, He saith to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let us go over to the other side.</q>
Mark 4:36 So they dismissed the multitude, and took Him as He was in the ship. But there were other small vessels likewise with Him.
Mark 4:37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now <transChange>almost</transChange> full.
Mark 4:38 And He was in the stern asleep on a pillow: and they awake Him, and say unto Him, Master, art thou under no concern that we are perishing?
Mark 4:39 And He rose and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Peace, be still;</q> and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
Mark 4:40 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why are ye so fearful? how! have ye no faith?</q>
Mark 4:41 And they were exceedingly afraid, and said to one another, Who is this? that even the wind and the sea obey Him? <chapter eID="gen1213" osisID="Mark.4"/>
Mark 5:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.5" sID="gen1255"/>
Mark 5:1 And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
Mark 5:2 And when He was come out of the ship, immediately there met Him from the tombs,
Mark 5:3 a man with an impure spirit, who kept among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains:
Mark 5:4 for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been pulled asunder by him, and the fetters broken; and no man could tame him:
Mark 5:5 and he was always night and day upon the hills and among the sepulchres bawling, and gashing himself with stones.
Mark 5:6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped Him,
Mark 5:7 and crying out with a loud voice said, Jesus <transChange>thou</transChange> Son of the most high God, what have I to do with thee? I adjure thee by God, that thou wouldst not torment me:
Mark 5:8 (for He said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>Thou</transChange> impure spirit, come out of the man.</q>)
Mark 5:9 And He asked him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What is thy name?</q> And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
Mark 5:10 And he earnestly intreated Him, that He would not send them out of that country.
Mark 5:11 Now there was a great herd of swine feeding upon the mountains:
Mark 5:12 and all the demons intreated Him, saying, Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.
Mark 5:13 And immediately Jesus permitted them: and the impure spirits went out <transChange>of the man,</transChange> and entered into the swine; and the herd (which were about two thousand,) ran violently down a precipice into the sea, and were suffocated.
Mark 5:14 And they that were feeding the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what was done:
Mark 5:15 and they come to Jesus, and see the demoniac, who had been possessed by the legion, sitting and clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
Mark 5:16 And when those that saw <transChange>it</transChange> told them what had happened to the demoniac,
Mark 5:17 and concerning the swine, they intreated Him to depart from their borders.
Mark 5:18 And as He went into the ship, the demoniac intreated Him that he might be with Him:
Mark 5:19 but Jesus did not permit him; but saith to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go home to thy <transChange>friends,</transChange> and tell them how great <transChange>things</transChange> the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee:</q>
Mark 5:20 and he departed, and published in Decapolis, how great <transChange>things</transChange> Jesus had done for him, and <transChange>they</transChange> were all amazed.
Mark 5:21 And when Jesus passed over again in the ship to the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto Him, nigh unto the sea.
Mark 5:22 And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus; and as soon as he saw Him, he fell at his feet,
Mark 5:23 and earnestly intreated Him, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death, <transChange>I beseech thee</transChange> that thou wouldst come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.
Mark 5:24 So <transChange>Jesus</transChange> went with him, and a great multitude followed Him, and pressed about Him.
Mark 5:25 And a woman who had been in a flux twelve years,
Mark 5:26 and had suffered a great deal from many physicians, and spent all that she had, and received no benefit, but rather grew worse,
Mark 5:27 when she heard of Jesus, came behind Him in the croud, and touched his garment; for she said,
Mark 5:28 If I can <transChange>but</transChange> touch his clothes, I shall be cured.
Mark 5:29 And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt within herself that she was healed of the disorder.
Mark 5:30 And immediately Jesus, knowing in Himself that power was gone out of Him, turned about in the croud and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Who touched my clothes?</q>
Mark 5:31 And his disciples said unto Him, Thou seest the multitude crouding about thee, and dost thou ask, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Who touched me?</q>
Mark 5:32 and He looked round about to see who had done it.
Mark 5:33 But the woman being afraid and trembling, <transChange>as</transChange> knowing what had been done in her, came and prostrated herself to Him, and told Him all the truth:
Mark 5:34 and He said to her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Daughter, thy faith has saved thee; go in peace, and be healed of thy disorder.</q>
Mark 5:35 While He was yet speaking, there came <transChange>some</transChange> from the ruler of the synagogue's <transChange>house,</transChange> saying, Thy daughter is dead, why dost thou trouble the Master any more?
Mark 5:36 But Jesus hearing the word that was spoken, immediately saith to the ruler of the synagogue, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Fear not, only believe:</q>
Mark 5:37 and He suffered none to go along with Him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
Mark 5:38 And He cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth a tumult, <transChange>people</transChange> weeping and lamenting greatly:
Mark 5:39 and when He was come in, He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why do ye take on <transChange>thus</transChange> and weep? the child is not dead, but asleep.</q>
Mark 5:40 And they laughed at Him: but when He had turned <transChange>them</transChange> all out, He taketh the father, and the mother of the child, and those <transChange>three</transChange> that were with Him, and goes in where the child was laid:
Mark 5:41 and taking hold of her hand, He saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Talitha, cumi,</q> which is, being interpreted, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Damsel, (I say unto thee) arise:</q>
Mark 5:42 and immediately the damsel rose up and walked; for she was twelve years old; and they were struck with great astonishment.
Mark 5:43 And He strictly charged them, that no one should know it: and bid <transChange>them</transChange> give her <transChange>something</transChange> to eat. <chapter eID="gen1255" osisID="Mark.5"/>
Mark 6:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.6" sID="gen1299"/>
Mark 6:1 And He went out from thence, and came into his own country, and his disciples attended Him:
Mark 6:2 and when the sabbath was come, He began to teach in the synagogue: and many that heard <transChange>Him</transChange> were astonished, and said, From whence hath He these <transChange>things?</transChange> and what <transChange>is this</transChange> wisdom <transChange>which is</transChange> given unto Him, that even such mighty things are done by his hands?
Mark 6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here among us? and they were prejudiced against Him.
Mark 6:4 But Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">A prophet is nowhere less honoured, than in his own country, and among his relations, and his own family.</q>
Mark 6:5 And He could do no miracle there, only laying his hands on a few sick people He healed them;
Mark 6:6 and He was amazed at their unbelief. But he went about <transChange>all</transChange> the villages round, teaching.
Mark 6:7 And He calleth unto Him the twelve, and sent them forth two <transChange>and</transChange> two, and gave them power over impure spirits;
Mark 6:8 and ordered them to take nothing for <transChange>their</transChange> journey, but a staff only; no bag, nor bread, nor money in <transChange>their</transChange> purse:
Mark 6:9 but to tie on <transChange>their</transChange> sandals, and not to put on two coats.
Mark 6:10 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">wheresoever ye enter into a house, there stay till ye leave that place.</q>
Mark 6:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And whosoever will not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgement, than for that city.</q>
Mark 6:12 And they went forth, and preached that <transChange>men</transChange> should repent.
Mark 6:13 And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many <transChange>that were</transChange> sick, and healed them.
Mark 6:14 And king Herod heard <transChange>of Him,</transChange> (for his name was spread abroad,) and he said, John the baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore miraculous powers appear in him.
Mark 6:15 Others said, it is Elias: and others said, it is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.
Mark 6:16 But when Herod heard <transChange>of Him,</transChange> he said, it is John whom I beheaded, he is risen from the dead.
Mark 6:17 For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her:
Mark 6:18 For John <transChange>had</transChange> said to Herod, it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
Mark 6:19 Wherefore Herodias persecuted him, and would have taken away his life:
Mark 6:20 but could not; for Herod revered John, knowing him to be a just and holy man, and protected him: and when he heard him he did many things <transChange>according to John's instructions,</transChange> and heard him willingly.
Mark 6:21 But a convenient day happening, when Herod on his birth-night gave a supper to his lords, and chief officers, and persons of distinction in Galilee; and the daughter of Herodias coming in,
Mark 6:22 and dancing, and having pleased Herod and his guests, the king said to the young princess, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give <transChange>it</transChange> thee.
Mark 6:23 And he gave her his oath <transChange>too,</transChange> whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give <transChange>it</transChange> thee, even to the half of my kingdom.
Mark 6:24 And she withdrew and consulted her mother, what to ask: and she said, The head of John the baptist.
Mark 6:25 And immediately she came in <transChange>again</transChange> with eagerness to the king, and said, I desire that thou wouldst give me directly the head of John the baptist in a dish.
Mark 6:26 And the king was exceedingly grieved, <transChange>but</transChange> on account of his oath, and those who were at table with <transChange>him,</transChange> he would not refuse her: but immediately sent one of his guard,
Mark 6:27 and ordered his head to be brought:
Mark 6:28 and he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel carried it to her mother.
Mark 6:29 And his disciples hearing <transChange>of it,</transChange> came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a sepulchre.
Mark 6:30 And the apostles came together to Jesus, and told Him all <transChange>things,</transChange> both what they had done, and what they had taught.
Mark 6:31 And He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Come ye yourselves apart into a retired place, and rest a little: for there were many coming and going, and they had not time even to eat.</q>
Mark 6:32 And they went away privately in a ship into a desert place.
Mark 6:33 And the people saw them departing, and many took notice of them, and ran thither on foot from all the cities, and got before them, and came together unto Him.
Mark 6:34 And when Jesus came out <transChange>of the ship,</transChange> He saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them; because they were as sheep without a shepherd: and He began to teach them many <transChange>things.</transChange>
Mark 6:35 And when it was now late in the day, his disciples came to Him, and said, this is a desert place, and it is now late:
Mark 6:36 dismiss them, that they may go into the country-places and villages round about, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.
Mark 6:37 But He answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye give them <transChange>something</transChange> to eat.</q> And they say to Him, shall we go and buy two hundred penny-worth of bread, and give them to eat?
Mark 6:38 But He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How many loaves have ye? go and see.</q> And when they had examined, they said, Five, and two fishes.
Mark 6:39 And He ordered them to cause all <transChange>the people</transChange> to sit down by companies upon the grass:
Mark 6:40 and they sat down in an oblong square, an hundred by fifty.
Mark 6:41 And when He had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven, and gave thanks; then He brake the loaves and gave <transChange>them</transChange> to his disciples, to set before them; the two fishes likewise He divided among them all.
Mark 6:42 And they did all eat and were <transChange>fully</transChange> satisfied.
Mark 6:43 And they took up of the fragments <transChange>of the bread,</transChange> and of the fishes, twelve baskets full.
Mark 6:44 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men.
Mark 6:45 And immediately He obliged his disciples to get into the ship, and to go before <transChange>Him</transChange> to the other side to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the people:
Mark 6:46 and when He had sent them away, He retired into a mountain to pray.
Mark 6:47 And when the evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and He alone upon the land:
Mark 6:48 and He saw them labouring in rowing; (for the wind was contrary:) and about the fourth watch of the night He cometh to them walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
Mark 6:49 But they seeing Him walking upon the water, thought it was an apparition, and cried out: for they all saw Him and were frighted.
Mark 6:50 And He immediately spake to them, and saith, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be of good courage, it is I, be not afraid.</q>
Mark 6:51 And He went up into the ship to them, and the wind ceased, and they were exceedingly amazed in themselves, and wondered: not considering <transChange>the miracle of</transChange> the loaves,
Mark 6:52 for their heart was stupified.
Mark 6:53 And they passed over and came to the country of Gennesaret, and put to shore:
Mark 6:54 and when they came out of the ship, immediately <transChange>the people</transChange> knew Him, and ran through all the country,
Mark 6:55 and carried about in beds those that were sick, where they heard He was.
Mark 6:56 And wherever He came into <transChange>their</transChange> towns, or cities, or villages, they laid the sick in the streets, and intreated Him that they might but touch the border of his garment, and as many as touched it were healed. <chapter eID="gen1299" osisID="Mark.6"/>
Mark 7:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.7" sID="gen1356"/>
Mark 7:1 And there were gathered unto Him the pharisees, and some of the scribes, from Jerusalem;
Mark 7:2 and when they saw some of his disciples eating with impure (that is, unwashed) hands, they found fault:
Mark 7:3 for the pharisees, and <transChange>indeed</transChange> all the Jews, do not eat till they have washed their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the ancients.
Mark 7:4 And <transChange>when they come</transChange> from the market, they do not eat till they have washed. And there are many other things, which they have received to observe, <transChange>as</transChange> the washing of cups, and pots, and brass-vessels, and seats.
Mark 7:5 Then the pharisees and the scribes ask Him, Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but eat without washing their hands?
Mark 7:6 But He answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me:</q>
Mark 7:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the injunctions of men.</q>
Mark 7:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye retain the tradition of men, <transChange>as</transChange> the washings of pots and cups, and many other such like things.</q>
Mark 7:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And ye expressly annul the commandment of God, that ye may retain your own tradition;</q>
Mark 7:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, He that revileth father or mother, let him be put to death:</q>
Mark 7:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but ye say, If a man tell <transChange>his</transChange> father or mother, That which thou mightest be profited by from me <transChange>is</transChange> Corban, (that is, a gift <transChange>to the temple) it sufficeth:</transChange></q>
Mark 7:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and <transChange>so</transChange> ye allow him to do nothing more for his father or his mother:</q>
Mark 7:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">making void the word of God by your tradition,. And many such like things ye do.</q>
Mark 7:14 And calling all the people to <transChange>Him,</transChange> He said unto them,
Mark 7:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Hear me all <transChange>of you,</transChange> and understand, There is nothing without a man, <transChange>which</transChange> entring into him can defile him: but <transChange>the things</transChange> proceeding from him are those which defile a man.</q>
Mark 7:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any <transChange>one</transChange> hath ears to hear, let him hear.</q>
Mark 7:17 And when He was come into the house, away from the multitude, his disciples asked Him concerning <transChange>the meaning of</transChange> the parable.
Mark 7:18 And He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Are ye so void of understanding also? Do ye not know, that whatsoever from without entreth into a man cannot defile him?</q>
Mark 7:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">because it entreth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all <transChange>his</transChange> food.</q>
Mark 7:20 But said He, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What cometh out of a man, that defileth the man;</q>
Mark 7:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts,</q>
Mark 7:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">adulteries, fornications, murthers, thefts, avarice, malice, deceit, lasciviousness, envy, slander, pride, folly;</q>
Mark 7:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">all these evils come from within and defile the man.</q>
Mark 7:24 And He arose and went from thence to the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and going into a house He would have had no body know it, but He could not be concealed: for a woman,
Mark 7:25 whose child was possessed by an evil spirit, having heard of Him, came and fell at his feet,
Mark 7:26 (now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation,) and she besought Him to cast out the demon from her daughter.
Mark 7:27 But Jesus said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let the children first be satisfied: for it is not fit to take the children's bread, and throw <transChange>it</transChange> to the dogs.</q>
Mark 7:28 And she answered and said unto Him, True, Lord, yet the dogs under the table, eat of the children's crumbs.
Mark 7:29 And He said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">For this saying, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter.</q>
Mark 7:30 And she went away to her house, and found the demon gone out, and her daughter laid on the bed.
Mark 7:31 And departing again out of the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the sea of Galilee thro' the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
Mark 7:32 And they brought to Him a deaf <transChange>man,</transChange> who had <transChange>likewise</transChange> an impediment in his speech, and pray Him to put his hand upon him.
Mark 7:33 And He took him aside out of the croud, and He spit and put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue:
Mark 7:34 and looking up to heaven He sighed, and saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ephphatha,</q> that is, <q marker="" who="Jesus">be opened:</q>
Mark 7:35 and immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake distinctly.
Mark 7:36 And He charged them to tell no one, but the more He charged them, the more they published <transChange>it:</transChange>
Mark 7:37 and were exceedingly astonished, saying, He hath done all <transChange>things</transChange> well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. <chapter eID="gen1356" osisID="Mark.7"/>
Mark 8:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.8" sID="gen1394"/>
Mark 8:1 In those days, there being again a very great multitude, and they having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to <transChange>Him,</transChange>
Mark 8:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and saith unto them, I have compassion on the multitude, for they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</q>
Mark 8:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if I send them away fasting to their own home, they will faint by the way; for some of them are come from far.</q>
Mark 8:4 And his disciples answered Him, From whence can <transChange>one</transChange> satisfy these <transChange>people</transChange> with bread here in a desert?
Mark 8:5 And He asked them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How many loaves have ye?</q> and they said, Seven.
Mark 8:6 And He ordered the people to sit down upon the ground: and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and brake <transChange>them,</transChange> and gave to his disciples to set before <transChange>them;</transChange> and they did set them before the multitude.
Mark 8:7 And they had a few small fishes: and He blessed <transChange>them,</transChange> and bid <transChange>them</transChange> set them also before <transChange>the people.</transChange>
Mark 8:8 And they did eat and were satisfied: and they took up what were left, <transChange>to wit</transChange> of fragments seven baskets:
Mark 8:9 and they that had eaten were about four thousand. And <transChange>then</transChange> He dismissed them.
Mark 8:10 And going directly on board a ship with his disciples, He came into the parts <transChange>of</transChange> Dalmanutha:
Mark 8:11 and the pharirisees came forth, and began to dispute with Him, desiring of Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him.
Mark 8:12 And He sighing deeply in his spirit, saith, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why doth this generation require a sign? Verily I tell you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.</q>
Mark 8:13 So He left them, and went on board the ship again, and departed to the other side.
Mark 8:14 And <transChange>his disciples</transChange> had forgot to take bread, neither had they <transChange>any</transChange> more than one loaf with them in the ship.
Mark 8:15 And <transChange>therefore</transChange> as He was giving them a charge, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take heed, beware of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod,</q>
Mark 8:16 they argued one with another, saying, <transChange>It is</transChange> because we have no bread.
Mark 8:17 And Jesus knowing <transChange>it</transChange> saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What are ye reasoning about? because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet discern nor understand? have ye your heart still hardened?</q>
Mark 8:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have ye eyes, and do not see? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</q>
Mark 8:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did ye take up?</q> They answer, Twelve.
Mark 8:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when <transChange>I divided</transChange> the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</q> and they said, Seven.
Mark 8:21 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How <transChange>is it then that</transChange> ye do not understand?</q>
Mark 8:22 Then He cometh to Bethsaida, where they brought to Him a blind <transChange>man,</transChange> and begged of Him that He would touch him.
Mark 8:23 And He took the blind <transChange>man</transChange> by the hand, and led him out of the town; and having spit on his eyes, He laid <transChange>his</transChange> hands upon him, and asked him, If he saw any thing.
Mark 8:24 And he looked up, and said, I see men (as it were trees) walking.
Mark 8:25 Then He put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored <transChange>to sight,</transChange> and saw <transChange>them</transChange> all plainly.
Mark 8:26 And He sent him away to his house, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Neither go into the town, nor tell any <transChange>one</transChange> in the town.</q>
Mark 8:27 Then Jesus and his disciples went out into the towns of Cesarea Philippi: and by the way He asked his disciples, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whom do men say that I am?</q>
Mark 8:28 And they answered, <transChange>Some say,</transChange> John the baptist; and others, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
Mark 8:29 And He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">But whom say ye that I am?</q> Peter answered and saith, Thou art the Christ.
Mark 8:30 And He charged them, that they should say <transChange>this</transChange> to no one concerning Him:
Mark 8:31 and began to tell them, that the Son of man must suffer much; and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes; and be put to death: and after three days rise again.
Mark 8:32 And this He spake <transChange>plainly and</transChange> openly. Upon which Peter began to rebuke Him.
Mark 8:33 But He turned about and looking on his disciples reproved Peter, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Get thee behind me Satan; for thou savourest not the things of God, but the things <transChange>that be</transChange> of men.</q>
Mark 8:34 And calling the people and his disciples to <transChange>Him,</transChange> He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whosoever is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me:</q>
Mark 8:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for he that would save his life, shall lose it; but he that would lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, shall save it.</q>
Mark 8:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his <transChange>own</transChange> soul?</q>
Mark 8:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">or what shall a man give <transChange>as</transChange> a ransom for his soul?</q>
Mark 8:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this degenerate and sinful age, of him will the Son of man be also ashamed, when He cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.</q> <chapter eID="gen1394" osisID="Mark.8"/>
Mark 9:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.9" sID="gen1433"/>
Mark 9:1 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, that there are some of those who stand here, that shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</q>
Mark 9:2 And after six days Jesus taketh with Him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up by themselves to a high mountain apart; and was transfigured before them:
Mark 9:3 and his raiment shone, <transChange>being</transChange> exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten.
Mark 9:4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark 9:5 Then said Peter to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles; one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias:
Mark 9:6 for he knew not what to say, for they were sore afraid.
Mark 9:7 And there was a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, hear <transChange>ye</transChange> Him.
Mark 9:8 And immediately looking round about, they saw no more <transChange>of</transChange> any one, but Jesus alone with them.
Mark 9:9 And as they came down from the mountain, He charged them to tell no one what they had seen, till after the Son of man were risen from the dead.
Mark 9:10 And they laid hold on that expression, querying among themselves, what means the rising from the dead?
Mark 9:11 Then they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say, that Elias must come first?
Mark 9:12 And He answered and told them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Elias doth indeed come first, and settle all things: <transChange>He told them</transChange> likewise how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things and be used contemptuously.</q>
Mark 9:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But I tell you, that Elias is come, and they have done to him whatever they would, as it is written of him.</q>
Mark 9:14 And when He came to the <transChange>other</transChange> disciples, He saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes disputing with them.
Mark 9:15 And immediately all the people, when they saw Him, were astonished; and running to <transChange>Him,</transChange> saluted Him.
Mark 9:16 And he asked the scribes, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What are ye disputing about?</q>
Mark 9:17 And one of the multitude answered, and said, Master I have brought unto thee my son, who is possessed by a dumb spirit:
Mark 9:18 and wherever it seizeth him, it convulseth him; and he fometh, and gnasheth his teeth, and <transChange>thus</transChange> he pineth away: and I desired thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
Mark 9:19 And He answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.</q>
Mark 9:20 And they brought him to Him: and as soon as he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into convulsions: and he fell upon the ground, and rolled <transChange>about</transChange> foming.
Mark 9:21 And He asked his father, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How long is it since this befel him?</q> And he said, From a child.
Mark 9:22 And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any <transChange>thing,</transChange> have compassion on us and help us.
Mark 9:23 And Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If thou canst believe, all things <transChange>are</transChange> possible to him that believeth.</q>
Mark 9:24 And the father of the child immediately cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe, help <transChange>thou</transChange> my unbelief.
Mark 9:25 when Jesus saw the people flock together, He rebuked the impure spirit, and said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, Come out of him, and enter no more into him.</q>
Mark 9:26 And when he had rored and vehemently convulsed him, he came out of him: and <transChange>the child</transChange> was as <transChange>one</transChange> dead, so that many said, that he was dead.
Mark 9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
Mark 9:28 And when He was come into the house, his disciples asked Him in private, Why could not we cast him out?
Mark 9:29 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This kind cannot be cast out, but by prayer and fasting.</q>
Mark 9:30 And they departed from thence and passed through Galilee, and He was not willing that any should know <transChange>it;</transChange>
Mark 9:31 for He was instructing his disciples, and told them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man is <transChange>going to be</transChange> delivered into the hands of men, and they will put Him to death; and on the third day, after his being put to death, He will rise again.</q>
Mark 9:32 But they knew not his meaning, and were afraid to ask Him.
Mark 9:33 And he came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He asked them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What were ye disputing <transChange>about</transChange> among yourselves by the way?</q>
Mark 9:34 But they held their peace; for they had been disputing with each other by the way who <transChange>should be</transChange> the greatest.
Mark 9:35 So He sat down and called the twelve, and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any <transChange>one</transChange> would be first, let him be last of all, and servant of all.</q>
Mark 9:36 And He took a child and set him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms He said unto them,
Mark 9:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whoever shall receive one of these little children in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me <transChange>only,</transChange> but Him that sent me.</q>
Mark 9:38 But John answered Him and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, who doth not follow us; and we forbade him, because he followeth not us.
Mark 9:39 But Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Forbid him not: for there is no one, that worketh a miracle in my name, and can presently speak evil of me:</q>
Mark 9:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for he that is not against us, is for us.</q>
Mark 9:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For whosoever shall give you <transChange>but</transChange> a cup of water to drink, for my sake; because ye are Christ's, I assure you, he shall not lose his reward.</q>
Mark 9:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And whosoever shall cause one of these little <transChange>ones,</transChange> that believe in me, to offend, it were better for him, if a milstone were laid upon his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</q>

Mark 10:1 And He arose from thence and came into the coasts of Judea, through <transChange>the country</transChange> beyond Jordan: and the people resorted to Him again; and, as He was wont, He taught them again.
Mark 10:2 And the pharisees came to <transChange>Him</transChange> and asked Him, "if it were lawful for a man to put away his wife," tempting Him.
Mark 10:3 And he answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What did Moses command you?</q>
Mark 10:4 And they said, Moses permitted <transChange>a man</transChange> to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.
Mark 10:5 And Jesus replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">He wrote this precept on account of your cruel tempers:</q>
Mark 10:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but from the beginning of the world, God created them male and female.</q>
Mark 10:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother,</q>
Mark 10:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and be joined to his wife, and <transChange>they</transChange> two shall be one flesh: so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.</q>
Mark 10:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Therefore let not man separate what God hath joined together.</q>
Mark 10:10 And <transChange>when they were</transChange> in the house his disciples asked Him again about it:
Mark 10:11 and He told them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery against her.</q>
Mark 10:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if a woman be divorced from her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</q>
Mark 10:13 And they brought to Him <transChange>little</transChange> children that He might touch them: and the disciples rebuked those that brought <transChange>them.</transChange>
Mark 10:14 Which Jesus observing, was much displeased, and said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let the children come to me; and hinder them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.</q>
Mark 10:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall by no means enter into it.</q>
Mark 10:16 And He took them in his arms, and put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
Mark 10:17 And as he went out into the way, <transChange>there came</transChange> one running and kneeling to Him, <transChange>and</transChange> asked Him, Good master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?
Mark 10:18 And Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why dost thou call me good? <transChange>there is</transChange> none good, but one, <transChange>that is</transChange> God.</q>
Mark 10:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour thy father and <transChange>thy</transChange> mother.</q>
Mark 10:20 And he answered and said unto Him, Master, all these have I kept from my youth.
Mark 10:21 Then Jesus looked upon him with affection, and said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">One <transChange>thing</transChange> thou wantest; go, sell all that thou hast, and give <transChange>it</transChange> to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross and follow me.</q>
Mark 10:22 But he was sad at <transChange>that</transChange> saying, and went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.
Mark 10:23 And Jesus looking <transChange>round</transChange> about saith to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</q>
Mark 10:24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus repeating <transChange>it,</transChange> saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Children, how hard is it for them, that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God!</q>
Mark 10:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</q>
Mark 10:26 And they were exceedingly amazed, saying one to another, Who then can be saved?
Mark 10:27 But Jesus looking upon them saith, <q marker="" who="Jesus">With men <transChange>it is</transChange> impossible, but not with God; for with God all <transChange>things</transChange> are possible.</q>
Mark 10:28 Then Peter said to Him, Behold we have left all, and followed thee.

Mark 10:33 <transChange>saying,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and deliver Him to the Gentiles;</q>
Mark 10:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and they will insult Him, and scourge Him, and spit upon Him, and put Him to death: but <transChange>on</transChange> the third day He shall rise again.</q>
Mark 10:35 Then come to Him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying, Master, we desire that thou wouldest do for us what we shall request:
Mark 10:36 and He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What do ye desire me to do for you?</q>
Mark 10:37 they said unto Him, Grant that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy glory.
Mark 10:38 But Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink <transChange>of</transChange> the cup, that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</q>
Mark 10:39 And they said, We can. And Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The cup indeed which I drink, ye shall drink of; and with the baptism, that I am baptized with, shall ye be baptized:</q>
Mark 10:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but to sit on my right <transChange>hand</transChange> and on my left, is not mine to give, but for whom it is prepared.</q>
Mark 10:41 And when the <transChange>other</transChange> ten heard <transChange>it,</transChange> they were provoked at James and John.
Mark 10:42 But Jesus called them to <transChange>Him,</transChange> and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye know that those who rule among the Gentiles, lord it over them, and their grandees exercise authority upon them.</q>
Mark 10:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But it shall not be so among you: but whoever would be great among you shall be your minister;</q>

Mark 10:47 And hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, <transChange>thou</transChange> son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark 10:48 And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace: but he cried out <transChange>so</transChange> much <transChange>the</transChange> more, <transChange>Thou</transChange> son of David, have pity on me.
Mark 10:49 And Jesus stopt, and ordered him to be called: so they call<transChange>ed</transChange> the blind <transChange>man,</transChange> and said to him, Be of good courage, rise up, He calleth thee.
Mark 10:50 And he threw off his <transChange>outer</transChange> garment, and arose, and came to Jesus.
Mark 10:51 And Jesus said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What dost thou desire <transChange>that</transChange> I should do for thee?</q> And the blind <transChange>man</transChange> said to Him, Lord, that I may recover <transChange>my</transChange> sight.

Mark 11:1 And when they came near to Jerusalem, <transChange>even</transChange> to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, He sendeth two of his disciples,
Mark 11:2 and saith to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go into the village over against you, and as soon as ye enter into it, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man hath <transChange>yet</transChange> sat; loose him, and bring <transChange>him to me.</transChange></q>
Mark 11:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if any <transChange>one</transChange> say to you, Why do ye so? tell <transChange>him,</transChange> that the Lord hath need of it, and he will immediately send it hither.</q>
Mark 11:4 And they went and found the colt tied at a door abroad, where two ways met, and they untied it.
Mark 11:5 And some <transChange>of the people</transChange> that stood there, said to them, What do ye mean <transChange>by</transChange> untying the colt?
Mark 11:6 And they answered them as Jesus had ordered, and they permitted them.
Mark 11:7 So they brought the colt to Jesus, and laid their garments on it, and He sat upon it.
Mark 11:8 And many spread their clothes in the way; and others cut <transChange>off</transChange> branches from the trees, and strewed <transChange>them</transChange> in the way.
Mark 11:9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna, blessed <transChange>be</transChange> He that cometh in the name of the Lord:
Mark 11:10 blessed <transChange>be</transChange> the kingdom of our father David, that is coming in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.
Mark 11:11 And Jesus went into Jerusalem, and into the temple; and when He had looked round upon every thing, it being now late in the day, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.
Mark 11:12 And on the morrow, as they came from Bethany, He was hungry:
Mark 11:13 and seeing a fig-tree at a distance, with leaves, He went <transChange>to see</transChange> if He might find any <transChange>thing</transChange> upon it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves; (for the time of <transChange>gathering</transChange> figs was not <transChange>yet come:</transChange>) And Jesus spake and said unto it,
Mark 11:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let no one ever eat fruit of thee hereafter.</q> And his disciples heard <transChange>it.</transChange>
Mark 11:15 Then they came to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to turn out those that sold and bought in <transChange>the court of</transChange> the temple, and threw down the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves:
Mark 11:16 and suffered not any <transChange>one</transChange> to carry a burthen through <transChange>the courts of</transChange> the temple.
Mark 11:17 And He taught them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Is it not written, my house shall be called an house of prayer for all nations? But ye have made it a den of thieves.</q>
Mark 11:18 And the scribes and chief priests heard <transChange>it,</transChange> and sought how to destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were struck with his doctrine.
Mark 11:19 And when it was evening, He went out of the city.
Mark 11:20 And in the morning, as they were passing by <transChange>it,</transChange> they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots.
Mark 11:21 And Peter remembring <transChange>the tree,</transChange> saith unto Him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst, is withered.
Mark 11:22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have faith in God: for verily I tell you,</q>
Mark 11:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that whosoever shall say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea," and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith shall be done, he shall have whatsoever he saith.</q>

Mark 12:1 And He began to speak unto them in parables. <q marker="" who="Jesus">A <transChange>certain</transChange> man planted a vineyard, and made a fence about <transChange>it,</transChange> and digged <transChange>a place for</transChange> the wine-fat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and travelled abroad.</q>

Mark 12:13 And they send to Him some of the pharisees, and of the Herodians to insnare Him in <transChange>his</transChange> discourse:
Mark 12:14 and these, when they came, said to Him, Master, we know that thou art a man of truth, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to pay tribute to Cesar, or not? should we give, or should we not give?
Mark 12:15 But He knew their hypocrisy, and said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why do ye tempt me? bring me a penny, that I may see <transChange>it.</transChange></q>
Mark 12:16 So they brought <transChange>one:</transChange> and He saith to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whose <transChange>is</transChange> this image and inscription?</q> And they said Cesar's.
Mark 12:17 And Jesus answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Render <transChange>then</transChange> unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</q> And they marvelled at Him.
Mark 12:18 Then come the sadducees to Him, who say there is no resurrection;
Mark 12:19 and they asked Him, saying, Master, Moses, in his writings tells us, if any one's brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, that his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
Mark 12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died and left no seed;
Mark 12:21 and the second took her, and died, and he left <transChange>no</transChange> seed neither; and the third likewise.
Mark 12:22 And <transChange>all</transChange> the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all died the woman also.
Mark 12:23 In the resurrection therefore, when they rise again, whose wife shall be of them; for <transChange>all</transChange> the seven had her to wife?
Mark 12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?</q>
Mark 12:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.</q>
Mark 12:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But as to the dead, that they are raised, have ye not read in the book of Moses, how God spake to him in the bush, saying, I <transChange>am</transChange> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</q>
Mark 12:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: therefore ye do greatly mistake.</q>
Mark 12:28 And one of the scribes, who heard them disputing, seeing that He answered them well, came to <transChange>Him</transChange> and asked Him, Which is the chief commandment of all?
Mark 12:29 And Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The first of all the commandments <transChange>is,</transChange> "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is <transChange>the</transChange> one Lord,</q>
Mark 12:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:" this is the first <transChange>or chief</transChange> commandment,</q>
Mark 12:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and the second <transChange>is</transChange> like <transChange>it, even</transChange> this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself:" there is no other commandment greater than these.</q>
Mark 12:32 And the scribe said unto Him, Truly, Master, thou hast spoke <transChange>exceeding</transChange> well; for there is one God, and there is no other beside Him.
Mark 12:33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love <transChange>his</transChange> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
Mark 12:34 And Jesus seeing that he answered discreetly, said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</q> And no one dared any more to put questions to Him.
Mark 12:35 And Jesus spake and said, <transChange>as He was</transChange> teaching in the temple, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How do the scribes say, that the Christ is the son of David?</q>
Mark 12:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for David himself said by the holy Spirit, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</q>
Mark 12:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">So that David himself calleth Him Lord: how then is He his son? And many <transChange>of the</transChange> people heard Him with pleasure.</q>
Mark 12:38 And He said unto them as He was teaching <transChange>them,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes, and salutations in public-places,</q>
Mark 12:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and <transChange>the</transChange> chief seats in the synagogues, and uppermost places at feasts;</q>
Mark 12:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">who devour widows houses, and for a shew <transChange>of religion</transChange> make long prayers: these shall receive <transChange>the</transChange> heavier judgement.</q>
Mark 12:41 And as Jesus was sitting over against the treasury, He saw how the people threw money into the treasury, and many <transChange>of the</transChange> rich put in much;
Mark 12:42 and there came a poor widow and put in two mites, that is, a farthing.
Mark 12:43 And He called his disciples to Him, and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, that this poor widow has given more than all those who have cast into the treasury.</q>
Mark 12:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For <transChange>they</transChange> all <transChange>have</transChange> contributed out of their abundance: but she out of her penury hath given all that she had, <transChange>even</transChange> her whole living.</q> <chapter eID="gen1571" osisID="Mark.12"/>
Mark 13:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.13" sID="gen1616"/>
Mark 13:1 And as He was going out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to Him, Master, behold what <transChange>fine</transChange> stones <transChange>are here,</transChange> and what <transChange>stately</transChange> buildings!
Mark 13:2 And Jesus answering said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou seest these grand buildings: <transChange>but</transChange> there shall not be left one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down.</q>
Mark 13:3 And as He was sitting on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,
Mark 13:4 <transChange>saying,</transChange> Tell us when these things shall be, and what <transChange>shall be</transChange> the sign when all these things are to be accomplished.
Mark 13:5 But Jesus answered them and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Beware least any <transChange>one</transChange> deceive you:</q>
Mark 13:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for many shall come in my name saying, I am <transChange>the Christ,</transChange> and shall deceive many.</q>
Mark 13:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when ye hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be not troubled; for <transChange>such things</transChange> must happen; but the end <transChange>will</transChange> not <transChange>be</transChange> yet.</q>
Mark 13:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in <transChange>divers</transChange> places, and famines and troubles: these <transChange>will be</transChange> the beginnings of sorrows.</q>
Mark 13:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But look to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and synagogues: and ye shall be scourged, and set before governors and kings on my account, for a testimony against them.</q>
Mark 13:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And the gospel must first be published to all nations.</q>
Mark 13:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when they shall lead <transChange>you</transChange> to deliver you up, be not anxiously careful beforehand what ye shall speak, neither premeditate: but whatever shall be suggested to you at that <transChange>very</transChange> time, this speak: for it is not you that speak, but the holy Spirit.</q>
Mark 13:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>One</transChange> brother shall betray <transChange>another</transChange> to death, and <transChange>the</transChange> father <transChange>the</transChange> son: and children shall appear against <transChange>their</transChange> parents, and cause them to be put to death.</q>
Mark 13:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And ye shall be hated by all <transChange>men</transChange> for my sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.</q>

Mark 14:1 Now <transChange>the feast of</transChange> the passover and unleavened bread was within two days: and the chief priests and the scribes were contriving how they might seize Him by treachery and put Him to death.
Mark 14:2 But they said, Not on the feast-<transChange>day,</transChange> least there be a tumult of the people.
Mark 14:3 And when He was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He was at table, there came a woman with an alabaster-<transChange>box</transChange> of ointment of spikenard, very valuable; and she brake the box and poured it on his head.
Mark 14:4 And there were some provoked <transChange>at it</transChange> and said, Why was this waste <transChange>made</transChange> of the ointment?
Mark 14:5 For it might have been sold for above three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they inveighed against her.
Mark 14:6 But Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let her alone, why do ye give her uneasiness?</q>
Mark 14:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">She has done a kind office to me. For ye have the poor always with you, and may do them good, whenever ye will; but me ye have not always.</q>
Mark 14:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">She has done what she could: she has embalmed my body beforehand against the burial.</q>
Mark 14:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, wheresoever this gospel is preached, through all the world, what she hath done shall also be told for a memorial of her.</q>
Mark 14:10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, in order to betray Him unto them.
Mark 14:11 And they were glad, when they heard <transChange>it,</transChange> and engaged to give him money. And he sought to betray Him at a proper season.
Mark 14:12 And on the first day <transChange>of the feast</transChange> of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the paschal lamb, his disciples said to Him, Where wouldst thou have us go and make preparation <transChange>for thee</transChange> to eat of the paschal lamb?
Mark 14:13 And He sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go into the city, and there will meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water:</q>
Mark 14:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">follow him, and where he goes in, say to the man of the house, The master inquireth, Where is the room, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?</q>
Mark 14:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he will shew you a large upper room ready prepared, there make preparation for us.</q>
Mark 14:16 And his disciples went out, and came into the city, and found <transChange>every thing</transChange> as He told them; and <transChange>so</transChange> prepared the passover.
Mark 14:17 And in the evening He cometh with <transChange>the rest of</transChange> the twelve.
Mark 14:18 And when they were sat down and eating <transChange>together,</transChange> Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me, who is <transChange>now</transChange> eating with me.</q>
Mark 14:19 And they were grieved, and said to Him one by one, Is it I?
Mark 14:20 Is it I? And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>It is</transChange> one of the twelve, that is <transChange>now</transChange> dipping with me in the dish.</q>
Mark 14:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The Son of man is going indeed as it is written concerning Him; but wo to that man by whom He is betrayed; it had been good for him, if that man had never been born.</q>
Mark 14:22 And as they were at table, Jesus took bread, and when He had blessed <transChange>it</transChange> He brake <transChange>it,</transChange> and gave <transChange>it</transChange> to them, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take, eat, This is my body:</q>
Mark 14:23 and He took the cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave <transChange>it</transChange> to them: and they all drank of it.
Mark 14:24 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This is <transChange>an emblem of</transChange> my blood <transChange>the seal</transChange> of the new covenant, which is <transChange>to be</transChange> shed for many:</q>
Mark 14:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>and</transChange> I assure you, that I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine, till the day when I <transChange>shall</transChange> drink it new in the kingdom of God.</q>
Mark 14:26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
Mark 14:27 And Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye will all <transChange>of you</transChange> be made to offend on my account this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered:</q>
Mark 14:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but after I am risen <transChange>again,</transChange> I will go before you into Galilee.</q>
Mark 14:29 But Peter said to Him, though all should be made to offend, yet <transChange>will</transChange> not I.
Mark 14:30 And Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell thee, that to day, <transChange>even</transChange> in this <transChange>very</transChange> night, before the cock crow twice thou wilt deny me thrice.</q>
Mark 14:31 But he said with the more vehemence, Though I should die with thee, I will never disown thee. And so likewise said they all.
Mark 14:32 And they came to a place called Gethsemane, and He saith to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Sit here whilst I <transChange>go and</transChange> pray.</q>
Mark 14:33 And He taketh Peter and James and John with Him, and He began to be overwhelmed with terror and anguish.
Mark 14:34 And He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My Soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, stay here and watch.</q>
Mark 14:35 And going a little farther, He prostrated Himself, and prayed, if it were possible, that this hour might pass from Him.
Mark 14:36 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Abba, Father, all things <transChange>are</transChange> possible to Thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou <transChange>wilt.</transChange></q>
Mark 14:37 And He cometh and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Simon, art thou sleeping? couldst thou not watch one hour?</q>
Mark 14:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Watch, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the body is weak.</q>
Mark 14:39 And He went away again, and prayed, <transChange>after</transChange> the same manner.
Mark 14:40 And when He returned, He found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to say to Him.
Mark 14:41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Are ye sleeping still and taking your rest? It is enough, the hour is come: behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</q>
Mark 14:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise, let us go; see the traitor is at hand.</q>
Mark 14:43 And immediately while He was yet speaking cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests, and scribes, and elders:
Mark 14:44 (Now the traitor had given them a sign, saying, <transChange>The man,</transChange> whom I shall kiss, is He; lay hold of Him and lead Him away safely:)
Mark 14:45 and as soon as he came, he went directly up to Him and said, Master, Master; and kissed Him.
Mark 14:46 And they laid their hands on Him, and apprehended Him.
Mark 14:47 And one of those that were present, drawing a sword, struck at the high priest's servant, and took off his ear.
Mark 14:48 And Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and clubs to take me?</q>
Mark 14:49 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye did not seize me: but <transChange>this is done</transChange> that the scriptures may be fulfilled.</q>
Mark 14:50 And <transChange>the disciples</transChange> all forsook Him and fled: but there followed Him a certain youth,
Mark 14:51 who had <transChange>only</transChange> a linen cloth wrapt about him, and the young men laid hold on him;
Mark 14:52 and he let go the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
Mark 14:53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest, with whom were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark 14:54 And Peter followed Him at a distance, even into the palace of the high priest: and sat down among the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
Mark 14:55 Now the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, to put Him to death, and found none:
Mark 14:56 for many bare false witness against Him, and the evidences did not agree.
Mark 14:57 At last there rose up some and bare false witness against Him,
Mark 14:58 saying, We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands:
Mark 14:59 but neither was their evidence consistent.
Mark 14:60 Then the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus saying, Answerest thou nothing? what do these <transChange>men</transChange> witness against thee?
Mark 14:61 but he held his peace, and made <transChange>him</transChange> no answer. <transChange>So</transChange> the high priest asked Him again, and saith to Him, Art thou the Messiah the Son of the blessed <transChange>God?</transChange>
Mark 14:62 And Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</q>
Mark 14:63 Then the high priest rent his clothes and said, What farther need have we of witnesses?
Mark 14:64 ye have heard the blasphemy; what think ye? and they all condemned Him as worthy of death.
Mark 14:65 And they spit upon Him, and blind-folded Him, and <transChange>then</transChange> buffeted Him and said to Him, prophesy <transChange>who it was:</transChange> and the officers struck him with <transChange>their</transChange> rods.
Mark 14:66 And Peter being in the hall below, there came one of the maid-servants of the high priest;
Mark 14:67 and when she saw Peter <transChange>as he was</transChange> warming himself, she looked earnestly upon him and said, Thou also wast with Jesus the Nazarene:
Mark 14:68 but he denied <transChange>it,</transChange> saying, I do not know <transChange>Him,</transChange> nor do I understand what thou meanest. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.
Mark 14:69 And the maid seeing him again said to them that stood by, This is <transChange>one</transChange> of them: and he denied <transChange>it</transChange> again.
Mark 14:70 And a little after, they that stood by, said to Peter again, Thou art certainly <transChange>one</transChange> of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is like <transChange>theirs.</transChange>
Mark 14:71 But he began to curse and swear <transChange>saying,</transChange> I do not know this man of whom ye speak: And the cock crowed a second time.
Mark 14:72 Then Peter called to mind the word which Jesus had said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Before the cock crow twice thou wilt deny me thrice.</q> And he covered <transChange>his face</transChange> and wept. <chapter eID="gen1654" osisID="Mark.14"/>
Mark 15:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.15" sID="gen1727"/>
Mark 15:1 And as soon as ever it was light the chief priests holding a consultation with the elders and scribes, <transChange>they</transChange> and the whole sanhedrim, bound Jesus, and carried <transChange>Him</transChange> away, and delivered <transChange>Him</transChange> to Pilate.
Mark 15:2 And Pilate asked Him, Art thou the king of the Jews? and He answered <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>It is as</transChange> thou sayst.</q>
Mark 15:3 And the chief priests accused Him of many <transChange>things:</transChange> but he answered nothing.
Mark 15:4 So Pilate asked Him again, saying, Dost thou answer nothing? See how many <transChange>things</transChange> they witness against thee:
Mark 15:5 but Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate was amazed.
Mark 15:6 Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired:
Mark 15:7 and there was <transChange>one</transChange> Barabbas under confinement with <transChange>some of his</transChange> accomplices in sedition, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark 15:8 And the people clamoured and desired <transChange>him to do</transChange> as he always used to do for them.
Mark 15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Would ye have me release to you the king of the Jews?
Mark 15:10 (for he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him up <transChange>to him</transChange> out of envy:)
Mark 15:11 but the chief priests incited the people <transChange>to desire</transChange> that he would rather release Barabbas to them.
Mark 15:12 And Pilate answered, and said to them again, What then would you have me do <transChange>with Him,</transChange> whom ye call king of the Jews?
Mark 15:13 And they cried out again, Crucify Him.
Mark 15:14 But Pilate said unto them, Why, what ill has He done? And they cried out the more vehemently, Crucify Him.
Mark 15:15 So Pilate being willing to ingratiate with the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered <transChange>Him</transChange> up to be crucified.
Mark 15:16 And the soldiers led Him away into the hall, which is <transChange>called</transChange> the Pretorium; and gathered their whole company together:
Mark 15:17 and they clad Him in purple, and platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head,
Mark 15:18 and saluted Him, <transChange>saying,</transChange> Hail king of the Jews;
Mark 15:19 and struck Him on the head with a reed, and spit upon Him, and bowed their knees, and did Him homage.
Mark 15:20 And when they had <transChange>thus</transChange> abused Him, they took off the purple from Him, and put his own clothes on Him, and brought Him out to crucify Him.
Mark 15:21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, <transChange>as he was</transChange> passing by, coming out of the country, to carry his cross:
Mark 15:22 and they brought Him to a place <transChange>called</transChange> Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a scull.
Mark 15:23 And they offered Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He would not take <transChange>it.</transChange>
Mark 15:24 And when they had fastened Him to the cross, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what each <transChange>of them</transChange> should take.
Mark 15:25 And it was the third hour, when they fixed Him on the cross:
Mark 15:26 and the title of his charge was written over <transChange>Him,</transChange> THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Mark 15:27 And they crucified two thieves with Him, one on his right <transChange>hand</transChange> and one on his left:
Mark 15:28 so that the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, "And He was numbered with the transgressors."
Mark 15:29 And they that passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest, the temple,
Mark 15:30 and buildest <transChange>it</transChange> in three days, save thyself and come down from the cross.
Mark 15:31 And the chief priests likewise scoffing <transChange>at Him</transChange> among themselves, with the scribes, said, He saved others, Himself He cannot save: let Christ,
Mark 15:32 the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe <transChange>in Him.</transChange> And <transChange>even</transChange> they that were crucified with Him, reviled Him.
Mark 15:33 Now at the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land, until the ninth hour.
Mark 15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,"</q> which is being interpreted, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</q>
Mark 15:35 And some of them that stood by hearing <transChange>it,</transChange> said, Behold He calleth upon Elias.
Mark 15:36 And there ran one, and filled a spunge with vinegar, and putting <transChange>it</transChange> on a reed offered it Him to drink, saying, Let <transChange>Him</transChange> alone, let us see whether Elias will come to take Him down.
Mark 15:37 But Jesus cried with a loud voice and expired.
Mark 15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
Mark 15:39 And when the centurion, that stood over against Him, saw that He expired with such a cry, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
Mark 15:40 There were also women at a distance looking on: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
Mark 15:41 who also when He was in Galilee, followed Him and waited on Him: and several others who came up to Jerusalem with Him.
Mark 15:42 And the evening being now come, (because it was the preparation,
Mark 15:43 or the day before the sabbath,) Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also was expecting the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
Mark 15:44 But Pilate wondered that He was dead already, and <transChange>therefore</transChange> calling for the centurion he asked him if He had been dead any time:
Mark 15:45 and when he heard <transChange>it</transChange> from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
Mark 15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock; and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.
Mark 15:47 And Mary Magdalene, and Mary <transChange>the mother</transChange> of Joses observed where He was laid. <chapter eID="gen1727" osisID="Mark.15"/>
Mark 16:0 <chapter osisID="Mark.16" sID="gen1775"/>
Mark 16:1 And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene, and Mary <transChange>the mother</transChange> of James, and Salome, bought spices in order to come and embalm Him:
Mark 16:2 and very early in the morning of the first <transChange>day</transChange> of the week they come to the sepulchre at sun-rising.
Mark 16:3 And they said to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulchre?
Mark 16:4 (but when they looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away,) for it was <transChange>a</transChange> very great <transChange>one.</transChange>
Mark 16:5 And they went into the sepulchre and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white robe; and they were affrighted:
Mark 16:6 but he said to them, Be not affrighted, ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified, He is risen, He is not here, see the place where they laid Him.
Mark 16:7 But go, tell his disciples, and Peter <transChange>particularly,</transChange> that He is going before you into Galilee: there ye will see Him, as He told you.
Mark 16:8 And they hasted out and fled from the sepulchre; for they were seized with trembling and amazement: neither said they any thing to any one; for they were afraid.
Mark 16:9 Now <transChange>Jesus</transChange> being risen early on the first day of the week appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven devils:
Mark 16:10 <transChange>and</transChange> she went and told those that used to be with Him, who were mourning and weeping;
Mark 16:11 but they, though they heard that He was <transChange>indeed</transChange> alive, and <transChange>had been</transChange> seen by her, did not believe <transChange>it.</transChange>
Mark 16:12 After this He appeared in another form to two of them <transChange>as they were</transChange> walking, going into the country:
Mark 16:13 and they went and told the rest; <transChange>but</transChange> they did not believe them neither.
Mark 16:14 At last he appeared to the eleven as they were sitting at table, and upbraided them with their unbelief, and hardness of heart; because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He was risen.
Mark 16:15 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go to all the world and preach the gospel to every one:</q>
Mark 16:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be condemned.</q>
Mark 16:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And these signs shall accompany them that believe; in my name shall they cast out demons, they shall speak with new tongues;</q>
Mark 16:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">they shall take up serpents, and if they should drink any <transChange>thing</transChange> poisonous, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be well.</q>
Mark 16:19 Now the Lord, after He had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
Mark 16:20 And they went forth and preached every where, the Lord co-operating <transChange>with them,</transChange> and confirming the word by miracles following upon <transChange>it.</transChange> Amen. <chapter eID="gen1775" osisID="Mark.16"/> <div eID="gen1101" osisID="Mark" type="book"/>

Luke 1:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.1" sID="gen1797"/>
Luke 1:1 <hi type="bold">Whereas</hi> many have undertaken to compose a narrative of the things, which have been fully certified among us;
Luke 1:2 as they delivered them to us, who were from the beginning eye-witnesses <transChange>of them,</transChange> and ministers of the word;
Luke 1:3 it seemed good to me also, having thoroughly traced <transChange>them</transChange> all from the <transChange>very</transChange> first, to write <transChange>an account of them</transChange> in order to thee,
Luke 1:4 most excellent Theophilus, that thou mayst know the certainty of the things wherein thou hast been instructed.
Luke 1:5 There was in the days of Herod king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia; and his wife <transChange>was</transChange> of the family of Aaron, and her name <transChange>was</transChange> Elisabeth.
Luke 1:6 And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
Luke 1:7 And they had no child, for Elisabeth was barren; and they were both far advanced in years.
Luke 1:8 And it came to pass, while he was in the order of his course performing the priest's office before God,
Luke 1:9 according to the custom of <transChange>dividing</transChange> the office of the priests, <transChange>that</transChange> it fell to his lot to burn incense, entring into the temple of the Lord:
Luke 1:10 and all the people were praying without at the time of offering incense.
Luke 1:11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right <transChange>hand</transChange> of the altar of incense.
Luke 1:12 And when Zacharias saw <transChange>him,</transChange> he was startled and struck with fear:
Luke 1:13 but the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John:
Luke 1:14 and he shall be a joy and transport to thee, yea, many shall rejoice on account of his birth; for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord,
Luke 1:15 and he shall drink neither wine nor <transChange>any other</transChange> strong liquor; and he shall be filled with the holy Spirit even from his birth;
Luke 1:16 and many of the children of Israel shall he convert unto the Lord their God.
Luke 1:17 And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to prepare for the Lord a people <transChange>well</transChange>-disposed.
Luke 1:18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife far advanced in years.
Luke 1:19 And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and <transChange>I</transChange> am sent to speak to thee, and to tell thee this good news:
Luke 1:20 and now shalt thou be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass; because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled at their season.
Luke 1:21 And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondered at his staying <transChange>so</transChange> long in the temple:
Luke 1:22 but when he came out he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them, and continued speechless:
Luke 1:23 and as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
Luke 1:24 And after these days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and retired five months,
Luke 1:25 saying, the Lord hath thus dealt with me in the days wherein he looked upon <transChange>me</transChange> to take away my reproach among men.
Luke 1:26 But in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee called Nazareth,
Luke 1:27 to a virgin <transChange>who was</transChange> betrothed to a man, whose name <transChange>was</transChange> Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin <transChange>was</transChange> Mary.
Luke 1:28 And when the angel came in <transChange>to the room</transChange> to her, he said, Hail, <transChange>thou that art</transChange> highly favoured; the Lord <transChange>is</transChange> with thee;
Luke 1:29 blessed <transChange>art</transChange> thou among women! and when she saw <transChange>him,</transChange> she was confused at what he said, and pondered in her mind what sort of salutation this could be.
Luke 1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favor with God:
Luke 1:31 and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS:
Luke 1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God shall give Him the throne of David his father,
Luke 1:33 and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
Luke 1:34 Then said Mary to the angel, How can this be, since I am a virgin?
Luke 1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee, and therefore <transChange>thine</transChange> holy offspring shall be called the Son of God: and lo,
Luke 1:36 thy cousin Elisabeth also hath conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren;
Luke 1:37 for nothing is impossible with God.
Luke 1:38 Then Mary said, Behold the servant of the Lord, may it be unto me according to thy word. So the angel departed from her.
Luke 1:39 Then Mary arose and went with speed into the hill-<transChange>country,</transChange> to a city of Juda,
Luke 1:40 and came into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
Luke 1:41 And as soon as Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the child leaped in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the holy Spirit:
Luke 1:42 and she cried out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed <transChange>art</transChange> thou among women, and blessed <transChange>is</transChange> the fruit of thy womb:
Luke 1:43 and whence <transChange>is</transChange> this <transChange>honor</transChange> to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
Luke 1:44 for behold, as soon as the voice of thy salutation reached my ears, the child in my womb leaped for joy:
Luke 1:45 and blessed <transChange>is</transChange> she that believed; for there shall be a performance of the things that were told her from the Lord.
Luke 1:46 And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour;
Luke 1:47 for He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaid:
Luke 1:48 for behold, from henceforth shall all generations call me blessed:
Luke 1:49 for He that is mighty hath done great things for me,
Luke 1:50 and his name <transChange>is</transChange> holy, and his mercy <transChange>is</transChange> on them that fear Him, unto all generations.
Luke 1:51 He hath wrought powerfully with his arm; He hath confounded <transChange>those that were</transChange> proud in the imagination of their heart.
Luke 1:52 He hath cast down the mighty from <transChange>their</transChange> thrones, and exalted the humble.
Luke 1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good <transChange>things,</transChange> and the rich He hath sent away empty.
Luke 1:54 He hath supported Israel his servant,
Luke 1:55 in remembrance of <transChange>his</transChange> mercy (even as He promised to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed,) for ever."
Luke 1:56 And Mary stayed with her about three months, and <transChange>then</transChange> returned to her own house.
Luke 1:57 Now when Elisabeth's time for her delivery was fully come, she brought forth a son:
Luke 1:58 and her neighbours and kindred heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they congratulated her;
Luke 1:59 and on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child: and they <transChange>would have</transChange> called him Zacharias, after the name of his father:
Luke 1:60 but his mother said, No, but he shall be called John:
Luke 1:61 and they said to her, There is none of thy relations of this name.
Luke 1:62 And they made signs to his father, what <transChange>name</transChange> he would have him called <transChange>by.</transChange>
Luke 1:63 And he called for a <transChange>writing</transChange>-tablet, and wrote upon it, His name is John: and they all wondered.
Luke 1:64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue <transChange>loosed,</transChange> and he spake and praised God.
Luke 1:65 And an awe fell upon all that dwelt round about them; and all these things were divulged through the whole hill-<transChange>country</transChange> of Judea.
Luke 1:66 And all that heard <transChange>them,</transChange> laid <transChange>them</transChange> up in their hearts, saying, What a child will this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
Luke 1:67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Spirit,
Luke 1:68 and prophesied, saying, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,
Luke 1:69 and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us,
Luke 1:70 in the house of his servant David, as He spake by the mouth of his holy prophets from the beginning,
Luke 1:71 <transChange>even</transChange> salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,
Luke 1:72 to display <transChange>his</transChange> mercy towards our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,
Luke 1:73 <transChange>according to</transChange> the oath which He sware to Abraham our father,
Luke 1:74 to grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him,
Luke 1:75 all the days of our life.
Luke 1:76 And thou, <transChange>my</transChange> child, shalt be called the prophet of the most High; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord,
Luke 1:77 to make known salvation to his people,
Luke 1:78 in the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring hath visited us from on high,
Luke 1:79 to enlighten them that sit in darkness and <transChange>in</transChange> the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace."
Luke 1:80 And the child grew, and became strong in spirit: and he was in the deserts till the time of his being manifested to Israel. <chapter eID="gen1797" osisID="Luke.1"/>
Luke 2:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.2" sID="gen1878"/>
Luke 2:1 Now in those days an edict was published by Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be enrolled <transChange>or taxed,</transChange>
Luke 2:2 (this tax was first levied when Cyrenius was governor of Syria) and they all went to be enrolled,
Luke 2:3 every one to his own city:
Luke 2:4 so Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he
Luke 2:5 was of the house and line of David) to be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was big with child.
Luke 2:6 And while they were there, the days of her delivery were fulfilled,
Luke 2:7 and she brought forth her son, the first-born, and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
Luke 2:8 And there were in the same country shepherds out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night: and lo,
Luke 2:9 an angel of the Lord stood over them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them, and they were greatly terrified:
Luke 2:10 and the angel said to them, Be not affrighted; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people,
Luke 2:11 that this day is born, in the city of David, your Saviour Christ the Lord.
Luke 2:12 And this <transChange>shall be</transChange> a sign to you, Ye shall find the child wrapped in swaddling bands lying in a manger.
Luke 2:13 And on a sudden there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host,
Luke 2:14 praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men.
Luke 2:15 And when the angels went from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this which hath been told <transChange>us,</transChange> which the Lord hath made known unto us.
Luke 2:16 And they came with speed, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger:
Luke 2:17 and when they had seen <transChange>it,</transChange> they divulged what had been told them concerning this child:
Luke 2:18 and all that heard <transChange>it,</transChange> were amazed at the things which were related to them by the shepherds.
Luke 2:19 But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering <transChange>them</transChange> in her heart.
Luke 2:20 And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all <transChange>the things</transChange> which they had heard and seen, according as <transChange>it</transChange> had been told unto them.
Luke 2:21 And when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, having been <transChange>so</transChange> called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
Luke 2:22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present <transChange>Him</transChange> before the Lord:
Luke 2:23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:) and to offer a sacrifice,
Luke 2:24 according to what is required in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.
Luke 2:25 And there was a man at Jerusalem, whose name <transChange>was</transChange> Simeon, and he <transChange>was</transChange> a just and a religious man, who expected the consolation of Israel; and the holy Spirit was upon him.
Luke 2:26 And it was revealed to him by the holy Spirit, that he should not die before he had seen the Anointed of the Lord.
Luke 2:27 And he came by <transChange>the influence of</transChange> the Spirit into the temple, as <transChange>his</transChange> parents brought in the child Jesus to do concerning Him according to the custom of the law:
Luke 2:28 and he took Him into his arms,
Luke 2:29 and blessed God, and said, "Now, Lord, thou dismissest thy servant in peace, according to thy word;
Luke 2:30 for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast provided in the sight of all people,
Luke 2:31 a light for the enlightening of the Gentiles,
Luke 2:32 and the glory of thy people Israel."
Luke 2:33 And Joseph and his mother were amazed at the things that were spoken concerning Him.
Luke 2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this <transChange>child</transChange> is appointed for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign <transChange>which shall be</transChange> spoken against,
Luke 2:35 (and a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be discovered.
Luke 2:36 And there was <transChange>one</transChange> Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; who was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her first marrying,
Luke 2:37 and <transChange>had been</transChange> a widow about eighty four years; who departed not from the temple; serving <transChange>God</transChange> with fastings and prayers night and day.
Luke 2:38 And coming in at the very same time, gave thanks unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all that were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.
Luke 2:39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
Luke 2:40 And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
Luke 2:41 Now his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover:
Luke 2:42 and when He was twelve years old, going up to Jerusalem, as usual at the feast, and having finished the time,
Luke 2:43 when they returned, the child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem: and Joseph and his mother did not know <transChange>it;</transChange>
Luke 2:44 but supposing Him to be in the company, went a day's journey, and <transChange>then</transChange> sought for Him among their kindred and acquaintance:
Luke 2:45 and not finding Him they returned to Jerusalem seeking for Him:
Luke 2:46 and after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, attending to them and asking them questions.
Luke 2:47 And all that heard Him were astonished at his understanding and <transChange>his</transChange> answers.
Luke 2:48 And when they saw Him, they were amazed. And his mother said to Him, Son, why didst thou deal thus with us? behold, thy father and I with grief have been seeking for thee.
Luke 2:49 And He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why did ye <transChange>so</transChange> seek me? Did not ye know that I ought to be in my Father's <transChange>house?</transChange></q>
Luke 2:50 but they did not understand the word which He spake to them.
Luke 2:51 Then He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
Luke 2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and <transChange>in</transChange> favor with God and men. <chapter eID="gen1878" osisID="Luke.2"/>
Luke 3:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.3" sID="gen1931"/>
Luke 3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis,
Luke 3:2 and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, Annas and Caiaphas being high priests, the word of God came unto John the Son of Zacharias in the wilderness:
Luke 3:3 and he went into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance in order to the remission of sins;
Luke 3:4 as it is written in the book of Esaias the prophet, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare <transChange>ye</transChange> the way of the Lord, make his paths straight:
Luke 3:5 every valley shall be raised, and every mountain and hill shall be lowered, and the crooked <transChange>ways</transChange> shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth:
Luke 3:6 and all men shall see the salvation of God."
Luke 3:7 Therefore said he to the multitudes that came to be baptised by him, <transChange>O</transChange> generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Luke 3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits becoming penitents, and do not say within yourselves, "We have Abraham for our father," for I tell you that God can of these stones raise up children to Abraham.
Luke 3:9 And now the ax is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which doth not yield good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.
Luke 3:10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
Luke 3:11 And he saith unto them, Let him that hath two coats, give <transChange>one</transChange> to him that hath none, and let him that hath food do the like.
Luke 3:12 And there came publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
Luke 3:13 And He said unto them, Exact no more than <transChange>what</transChange> is appointed you.
Luke 3:14 And the soldiers also asked him, saying, And what shall we do? and He said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse <transChange>any</transChange> falsely, and be content with your pay.
Luke 3:15 Now as the people were in suspense, and were all thinking in their hearts concerning John, whether he were the Christ <transChange>or not,</transChange>
Luke 3:16 John answered and said to <transChange>them</transChange> all, I indeed baptize you with water; but a mightier than I is coming, whose shoes I am not worthy to untie: He will baptize you with the holy Spirit, and with fire;
Luke 3:17 whose fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat into his granary, but will burn up the chaff in unquenchable fire.
Luke 3:18 And many other <transChange>things</transChange> by way of exhortation did he preach unto the people.
Luke 3:19 But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the wicked <transChange>things</transChange> which Herod did,
Luke 3:20 added this likewise to all <transChange>the rest,</transChange> that he shut up John in prison.
Luke 3:21 Now, when all the people were baptized, and Jesus was baptized and praying,
Luke 3:22 the heaven was opened, and the holy Spirit descended in a corporeal form, like a dove upon Him, and there came a voice from heaven saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
Luke 3:23 And Jesus was <transChange>then</transChange> about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) <transChange>the</transChange> son of Joseph, the <transChange>son</transChange> of Heli,

Luke 4:1 Now Jesus being full of the holy Spirit, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted by the devil;
Luke 4:2 and He did eat nothing in <transChange>all</transChange> those days: and when they were ended, at last He was hungry.
Luke 4:3 And the devil said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.
Luke 4:4 And Jesus answered him, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is written, that man shall not live by bread only, but on every word of God.</q>
Luke 4:5 And the devil taking Him up into an high mountain, shewed Him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant,
Luke 4:6 and said to Him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for it is committed to me, and I give it to whomsoever I will.
Luke 4:7 Therefore, if thou wilt <transChange>but</transChange> worship me, <transChange>they</transChange> all shall be thine.
Luke 4:8 And Jesus answering him said <transChange>with indignation,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.</q>
Luke 4:9 And he brought Him to Jerusalem, and set him on a battlement of the temple, and said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;
Luke 4:10 for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee,
Luke 4:11 to keep thee, and they shall bear thee up in <transChange>their</transChange> hands, least thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Luke 4:12 And Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">it is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</q>
Luke 4:13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from Him for a time.
Luke 4:14 And Jesus returned by the influence of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame was spread through all the country round about concerning Him:
Luke 4:15 and He taught in their synagogues with universal applause.
Luke 4:16 And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and according to his custom He went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and stood up to read.
Luke 4:17 And there was delivered to Him the book of the prophet Esaias; and opening the book, He found the place where it was written,
Luke 4:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">"The spirit of the Lord <transChange>is</transChange> upon me <transChange>to the end,</transChange> for which He hath anointed me: He hath sent me to publish good tidings to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to release them that are bruised,</q>
Luke 4:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>and</transChange> to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."</q>
Luke 4:20 And He folded up the book, and gave <transChange>it</transChange> again to the minister, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon Him.
Luke 4:21 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</q>
Luke 4:22 And they all bare witness to Him, and wondered at the gracefulness of the words, which proceeded from his mouth, and said, Is not this the son of Joseph?
Luke 4:23 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">No doubt ye will apply to me this proverb, "Physician, cure thyself, and do here in thy own country what we have heard <transChange>were</transChange> done at Capernaum."</q>
Luke 4:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But,</q> said He, <q marker="" who="Jesus">indeed I <transChange>must</transChange> tell you, that no prophet is <transChange>well</transChange> received in his own country.</q>
Luke 4:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I assure you, there were many widows in Israel, in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, and there was a great famine through all the land;</q>
Luke 4:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but Elias was sent to none of those <transChange>widows,</transChange> but to a widow-woman at Sarepta <transChange>in the territory</transChange> of Sidon.</q>
Luke 4:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">There were also many lepers in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed; but Naaman the Syrian <transChange>was.</transChange></q>
Luke 4:28 And all the synagogue were filled with rage, when they heard these <transChange>things,</transChange>
Luke 4:29 and they rose up and drove Him out of the city, and dragged Him to the brow of the hill, on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down the precipice.
Luke 4:30 But He passed through the midst of them, and went away.
Luke 4:31 And He came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath-days,
Luke 4:32 and they were astonished at his doctrine; for He spake with authority.
Luke 4:33 And there was a man in the synagogue possessed by the spirit of an impure demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
Luke 4:34 saying, Let us alone, what hast thou to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the holy <transChange>one</transChange> of God:
Luke 4:35 but Jesus rebuked him, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be silent, and come out of him.</q> And the demon threw him <transChange>down</transChange> in the midst <transChange>of the assembly,</transChange> and came out of him, having done him no hurt.
Luke 4:36 And they were all amazed, and said one to another, What a speech is this? for with authority and power He commandeth the impure spirits, and they come out!
Luke 4:37 And his fame spread all over the country round about.
Luke 4:38 And He rose up <transChange>and went</transChange> out of the synagogue, and came into the house of Simon: now Simon's wife's mother had a violent fever, and they intreated Him on her behalf.
Luke 4:39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and <transChange>it</transChange> left her: and immediately she arose and waited upon them.
Luke 4:40 And at sun-set all that had <transChange>any persons</transChange> sick of any diseases, brought them to Him: and He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.
Luke 4:41 And demons also came out from many, crying out, Thou art the Messiah the Son of God. And He rebuked <transChange>them,</transChange> and suffered them not to say, that they knew Him to be the Christ.
Luke 4:42 And when the day was coming on, He went out and retired into a solitary place; and the people sought for Him, and came to Him, and <transChange>would fain have</transChange> detained Him, that He might not go from them.
Luke 4:43 But He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</q>
Luke 4:44 So He went <transChange>on</transChange> preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. <chapter eID="gen1970" osisID="Luke.4"/>

Luke 5:1 And when the people were pressing on Him to hear the word of God, as He stood by the lake of Gennesareth, seeing two vessels at <transChange>the edge of</transChange> the lake,
Luke 5:2 (but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <transChange>their</transChange> nets:)
Luke 5:3 He went into one of them, which was Simon's, and desired him to put off a little <transChange>way</transChange> from the shore: and He sat down and taught the multitudes from the ship.
Luke 5:4 And when He had done speaking, He said to Simon, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</q>
Luke 5:5 And Simon answered and said unto Him, Master, we have been toiling all the night, and have caught nothing; however at thy word I will cast the net.
Luke 5:6 And when they had done this, they inclosed a multitude of fishes; and their net was breaking.
Luke 5:7 And they beckoned to <transChange>their</transChange> partners <transChange>that were</transChange> in the other ship, to come and help them; and they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were <transChange>even</transChange> sinking: and when Simon Peter saw <transChange>it,</transChange>
Luke 5:8 he fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Lord, depart from me, for I am a sinful man;
Luke 5:9 for he was astonished, and all <transChange>that were</transChange> with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken;
Luke 5:10 as were also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Be not afraid, from henceforth thou shalt be a captor of men.</q>
Luke 5:11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they left all and followed Him.
Luke 5:12 And when He was in one of the cities <transChange>of that country,</transChange> behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell prostrate <transChange>to Him,</transChange> and besought Him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.
Luke 5:13 And <transChange>Jesus</transChange> stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I will; be thou cleansed:</q> and immediately the leprosy departed from him.
Luke 5:14 And He charged him to tell no one: <q marker="" who="Jesus">but go,</q> <transChange>said He,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</q>
Luke 5:15 But the fame of Him spread more <transChange>and more,</transChange> and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.
Luke 5:16 But He <transChange>frequently</transChange> retired into solitary places, and prayed.
Luke 5:17 And one day, as He was teaching, there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and <transChange>from</transChange> Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was <transChange>present</transChange> to heal the people:
Luke 5:18 and behold, <transChange>some</transChange> men bringing on a couch a man that was paralytic; and they endeavoured to bring him in, and lay <transChange>him</transChange> before Him:
Luke 5:19 but when they could not find what <transChange>way</transChange> to bring him in because of the croud, they went up on <transChange>the battlements of</transChange> the house, and let him down from the roof with <transChange>his</transChange> couch, into the midst before Jesus,
Luke 5:20 who seeing their faith said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</q>
Luke 5:21 And the scribes and pharisees began to cavil, saying, Who is this that talketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God?
Luke 5:22 but Jesus knowing their thoughts, answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What are ye disputing in your hearts?</q>
Luke 5:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Rise up and walk?</q>
Luke 5:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but that ye may know, that the Son of man hath power <transChange>even</transChange> on earth to forgive sins,</q> (He spake to the paralytic) <q marker="" who="Jesus">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go to thine house.</q>
Luke 5:25 And immediately he rose up before them, took up <transChange>the bed</transChange> on which he lay, and went away to his house, glorifying God.
Luke 5:26 And they were all amazed and glorified God, and were filled with awe, saying, we have seen wonderful <transChange>things</transChange> to-day.
Luke 5:27 After these <transChange>things</transChange> He went out and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the custom-<transChange>house,</transChange> and said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Follow me:</q>
Luke 5:28 and he left all, rose up, and followed Him.
Luke 5:29 And Levi made Him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great number of publicans, and others at table with them.
Luke 5:30 And their scribes and pharisees murmured at his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
Luke 5:31 And Jesus answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">They that are in health have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I am not come to call the righteous,</q>
Luke 5:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but sinners to repentance.</q>
Luke 5:33 And they said unto Him, Why do the disciples of John frequently fast and pray, and likewise those of the pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
Luke 5:34 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Can ye make those of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</q>
Luke 5:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, then they will fast.</q>
Luke 5:36 Then He spake a parable to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">That no one putteth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment: otherwise, the new maketh a rent, and doth not match the old:</q>
Luke 5:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">nor doth any one put new wine in to old vessels; otherwise, the new wine will burst the casks, and be spilled, and the vessels will be destroyed:</q>
Luke 5:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but new wine must be put into new vessels, and <transChange>then</transChange> both are saved.</q>
Luke 5:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And no one that has been drinking old <transChange>wine,</transChange> immediately desireth new; for he saith, the old is better.</q> <chapter eID="gen2015" osisID="Luke.5"/>

Luke 6:1 And it came to pass on the second-sabbath after the first, that as He was passing through the corn-fields, his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and rubbed <transChange>them</transChange> in <transChange>their</transChange> hands and ate <transChange>them.</transChange>
Luke 6:2 And some of the pharisees said to them, Why do ye do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?
Luke 6:3 And Jesus answering them said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have ye not read what David did, when <transChange>he</transChange> himself was hungry and those that were with him? how he went into the house of God,</q>
Luke 6:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and did take and eat the shew-bread, and gave also to his attendants, which it is not lawful <transChange>for any</transChange> to eat but the priests.</q>
Luke 6:5 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.</q>
Luke 6:6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that He went into a synagogue and taught; and there was a man there, whose right hand was withered.
Luke 6:7 And the scribes and pharisees watched Him <transChange>to see</transChange> if He would work a cure on the sabbath: that they might find an accusation against Him.
Luke 6:8 But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man that had the withered hand, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise, and stand in the midst:</q> and he rose up and stood <transChange>forth.</transChange>
Luke 6:9 Then said Jesus unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I will ask you one <transChange>thing,</transChange> Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to let <transChange>it</transChange> be lost?</q>
Luke 6:10 And looking round upon them all, He said to the man, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Stretch out thine hand:</q> and he did so, and his hand was made <transChange>as</transChange> sound as the other.
Luke 6:11 And they were filled with confusion: and consulted together, what they might do to Jesus.
Luke 6:12 And in those days He went out to a mountain to pray, and He continued all night in prayer to God.
Luke 6:13 And when it was day, He called his disciples to <transChange>Him:</transChange> and chose out twelve from <transChange>among</transChange> them, whom He also named <transChange>his</transChange> apostles:
Luke 6:14 (<transChange>to wit,</transChange> Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
Luke 6:15 Matthew and Thomas, James <transChange>the son</transChange> of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes, and Judas <transChange>the brother</transChange> of James,
Luke 6:16 and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor:)
Luke 6:17 and He came down <transChange>the hill</transChange> with them, and stood in the plain; with the rest of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all <transChange>the parts of</transChange> Judea, and <transChange>from</transChange> Jerusalem, and <transChange>from</transChange> the coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases,
Luke 6:18 even those that were tormented by impure spirits: and they were healed.
Luke 6:19 And all the people endeavoured to touch Him, for there went <transChange>a divine</transChange> virtue out of Him, and healed <transChange>them</transChange> all.
Luke 6:20 And lifting up his eyes on his disciples He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed <transChange>are ye though</transChange> poor; for the kingdom of God is yours.</q>

Luke 7:4 And when they came to Jesus, they intreated Him earnestly, saying, he is worthy of this favor:
Luke 7:5 for he loveth our nation, and hath built us a synagogue.
Luke 7:6 So Jesus went with them. And when He was now not far from the house, the centurion sent <transChange>some of his</transChange> friends to Him, saying Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof:
Luke 7:7 neither did I think myself worthy to come unto thee. But speak the word, and my servant will be recovered.
Luke 7:8 For I also am a man placed under <transChange>the</transChange> authority <transChange>of others,</transChange> and have soldiers under me; and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth <transChange>it.</transChange>
Luke 7:9 And when Jesus heard these <transChange>things,</transChange> He marvelled, and turning <transChange>about,</transChange> said to the multitude that followed Him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I declare unto you, I have not found so great faith, no not in Israel.</q>
Luke 7:10 And when they that were sent, returned to the house, they found the servant well, that had been sick.
Luke 7:11 And the day after He went to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with Him, and a great multitude <transChange>besides:</transChange>
Luke 7:12 and as He came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carrying out <transChange>to be buried,</transChange> his mother's only son, and she <transChange>was</transChange> a widow: and many <transChange>of the</transChange> people of the city were with her.
Luke 7:13 And when the Lord saw her, He was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do not weep.</q>
Luke 7:14 And He came up and touched the bier, (and the bearers stopped,) and He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Young man, I say unto thee, arise.</q>
Luke 7:15 And the dead <transChange>person</transChange> sat up, and began to speak: and He delivered him to his mother.
Luke 7:16 And an awe seized <transChange>them</transChange> all, and they glorified God, saying, a great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited his people.

Luke 7:18 And the disciples of John told him of all these things: so John called two of his disciples to <transChange>him,</transChange>

Luke 7:24 When the messengers of John were departed, He began to speak unto the people concerning John, <q marker="" who="Jesus">what went ye out into the wilderness to see?</q>
Luke 7:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">a reed shaken by the wind? but what did ye go out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that are <transChange>dressed</transChange> in fine clothes and live delicately, are in palaces, <transChange>not in deserts:</transChange> but what went ye out to see?</q>
Luke 7:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">a prophet? yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</q>
Luke 7:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">This is <transChange>he</transChange> of whom it is written, "Behold I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee:"</q>
Luke 7:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for I tell you <transChange>that</transChange> among the sons of men there is not a greater prophet than John the baptist: (though the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he:)</q>
Luke 7:29 ---and all the people that heard <transChange>him,</transChange> even the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John;
Luke 7:30 but the pharisees <transChange>indeed</transChange> and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God within themselves, and were not baptized by him.---
Luke 7:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whereunto therefore shall I compare the men of this generation?</q>
Luke 7:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and to what are they like? they are like children sitting in <transChange>the</transChange> market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, "We have played <transChange>pleasant</transChange> tunes to you, and ye have not danced; we have sung mournful ones and ye have not wept:"</q>
Luke 7:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for John the baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, he hath a demon:</q>
Luke 7:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man is come eating and drinking <transChange>like other men,</transChange> and ye call Him a gluttonous man and a wine bibber, <transChange>and</transChange> a friend of publicans and sinners.</q>

Luke 7:36 And one of the pharisees asked Him to eat with him: and He went into the pharisee's house, and sat down.
Luke 7:37 And behold a woman in the city, that was a sinner, when she knew that He was at table in the pharisee's house,
Luke 7:38 brought an alabaster-<transChange>box</transChange> of ointment, and stood at his feet behind Him, weeping, and washed his feet with tears, and wiped <transChange>them</transChange> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <transChange>them</transChange> with the ointment.
Luke 7:39 But when the pharisee that invited Him saw <transChange>it,</transChange> he said within himself, This <transChange>man,</transChange> if he were a prophet, would have known who and what sort of a woman <transChange>this is</transChange> that toucheth Him; for she is a <transChange>notorious</transChange> sinner.
Luke 7:40 And Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Simon, I have something to say to thee:</q> (and he replied, Master, say <transChange>on.</transChange>)
Luke 7:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus">A certain creditor had two debtors, the one owed <transChange>him</transChange> five hundred denaries, and the other fifty:</q>
Luke 7:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and they not being able to pay <transChange>him,</transChange> he freely forgave them both: tell <transChange>me</transChange> therefore, which of them will love him most?</q>
Luke 7:43 And Simon answered, I suppose <transChange>he</transChange> to whom he forgave most. And <transChange>Jesus</transChange> said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou hast rightly judged:</q>
Luke 7:44 and turning to the woman, He said to Simon, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Dost thou see this woman? I came into thine house, <transChange>and</transChange> thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she has bathed my feet with <transChange>her</transChange> tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</q>
Luke 7:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou gavest me not <transChange>the respect of</transChange> a kiss; but this woman, ever since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</q>
Luke 7:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou didst not anoint my head with <transChange>common</transChange> oil, but she hath anointed <transChange>even</transChange> my feet with <transChange>sweet</transChange> ointment.</q>
Luke 7:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wherefore, I tell thee, her sins <transChange>though</transChange> many are forgiven, for she loved much: but <transChange>he</transChange> to whom little is forgiven, loveth <transChange>but</transChange> little.</q>
Luke 7:48 And He said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thy sins are forgiven.</q>
Luke 7:49 And they that sat at table with Him, said within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
Luke 7:50 But He said to the woman, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.</q> <chapter eID="gen2105" osisID="Luke.7"/>

Luke 8:1 And it came to pass afterwards that He went through every city and village, preaching and declaring the good tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve <transChange>were</transChange> with Him;
Luke 8:2 and some women that had been cured of evil spirits and <transChange>other</transChange> infirmities, <transChange>as</transChange> Mary Magdalene, out of whom were cast seven demons,
Luke 8:3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who assisted Him with their substance.
Luke 8:4 And when a great multitude was gathered together, of those that came to Him out of every city, He spake a parable <transChange>saying,</transChange>
Luke 8:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he was sowing, some fell by the way-<transChange>side,</transChange> and was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</q>
Luke 8:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And some fell upon stony ground, and as soon as it sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</q>
Luke 8:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with <transChange>it</transChange> and choked it.</q>
Luke 8:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But some fell on good ground, and sprang up and yielded fruit an hundred-fold.</q> And as He said these things He cried out, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."</q>
Luke 8:9 And his disciples asked Him, what might be <transChange>the meaning of</transChange> this parable.
Luke 8:10 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">To you it is granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but <transChange>I</transChange> <transChange>speak</transChange> to others in parables, that <transChange>in</transChange> seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</q>
Luke 8:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now this is <transChange>the meaning of</transChange> the parable, The seed is the word of God:</q>
Luke 8:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and those by the way-<transChange>side,</transChange> are such as hear <transChange>indeed; but</transChange> then the devil cometh and taketh away the word from their hearts, least they should believe and be saved.</q>
Luke 8:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And those on stony-ground <transChange>are</transChange> such as when they hear, receive the word with joy; but have no root, and <transChange>so</transChange> believe <transChange>only</transChange> for a while, and in <transChange>the</transChange> time of trial fall away.</q>
Luke 8:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And that which fell among thorns, are those who when they have heard <transChange>the word</transChange> go away and are choked with <transChange>the</transChange> cares and riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</q>
Luke 8:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But that on the good ground, are those who having heard the word, retain <transChange>it</transChange> in a good and honest heart, and bring forth fruit with patience.</q>
Luke 8:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">No man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a couch; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.</q>
Luke 8:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">(For there is nothing secret, that shall not be made manifest: nor any thing concealed, which shall not be <transChange>made</transChange> known and come to light.)</q>
Luke 8:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever <transChange>improveth what he</transChange> hath, to him shall <transChange>more</transChange> be given; and whosoever hath not, even what he seemeth to have shall be taken from him.</q>
Luke 8:19 Now his mother and his brethren came to Him, and could not come at Him for the croud:
Luke 8:20 and it was told Him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee.
Luke 8:21 And He answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God and do it.</q>
Luke 8:22 And it came to pass on one of the days <transChange>that</transChange> He went into a ship, Himself and his disciples, and He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let us go over to the other side of the lake.</q>
Luke 8:23 And they launched forth: but as they were failing, He fell asleep: and a storm of wind came down upon the lake, and they were filled <transChange>with water,</transChange> and were in <transChange>great</transChange> danger.
Luke 8:24 And they came to <transChange>Him</transChange> and awoke Him, saying, Master, master, we are perishing. Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luke 8:25 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Where is your faith?</q> But they were struck with awe and amazement, and said one to another, who is this? for He commandeth even the winds and the sea, and they obey Him.
Luke 8:26 And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
Luke 8:27 And when He was landed, there met Him a man out of the city, who had <transChange>been possessed by</transChange> demons a long while, and wore no clothes, and abode in no dwelling but the tombs.
Luke 8:28 But when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down to Him, and said with a loud voice, What have I <transChange>to do</transChange> with thee, Jesus, <transChange>thou</transChange> Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.
Luke 8:29 (For He commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man; which had oftentimes seized him <transChange>so violently,</transChange> that tho' he was bound with chains and fetters, yet he broke the bands asunder, and was driven by the demon into <transChange>those</transChange> lonely places.)
Luke 8:30 And Jesus asked him, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What is thy name?</q> and he said, Legion: because many demons were entred into him.
Luke 8:31 And they besought Him that He would not command them to go into the abyss:
Luke 8:32 but <transChange>as</transChange> there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, they intreated Him that He would suffer them to enter into them, and He permitted them.
Luke 8:33 So the demons went out of the man and entred into the swine: and the herd ran violently down the hill into the lake and were drowned.
Luke 8:34 And when those that looked after them saw what was done they fled; and went and told <transChange>it</transChange> in city and country:
Luke 8:35 and <transChange>the people</transChange> went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus; and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind:
Luke 8:36 and they were afraid, for those that saw <transChange>it</transChange> told them how the demoniac was healed.
Luke 8:37 And all the people of the country round about the Gadarenes desired Him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear: and He went into the ship and returned.
Luke 8:38 Now the man from whom the demons were gone out, prayed Him to <transChange>let him</transChange> be with Him: but Jesus sent him away,
Luke 8:39 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Return home, and relate what God hath done for thee.</q> So he went away publishing through the whole city what great <transChange>things</transChange> Jesus had done to him.
Luke 8:40 And when Jesus returned, a <transChange>great</transChange> multitude <transChange>of people</transChange> received Him; for they were all waiting for Him.
Luke 8:41 And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, and he fell at the feet of Jesus, and intreated Him to come into his house:
Luke 8:42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years <transChange>old,</transChange> and she was dying. (But as He was going, the people crouded Him:
Luke 8:43 and a woman who had been in a flux twelve years, and had spent <transChange>her</transChange> whole livelyhood upon physicians,
Luke 8:44 but could not be healed by any, came close behind Him and touched the hem of his garment, and immediately her flux was stopt.
Luke 8:45 And Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Who touched me?</q> When all denied <transChange>it,</transChange> Peter, and those that were with him, said, Sir, the multitudes throng and press thee, and dost thou ask, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Who <transChange>was it</transChange> that touched me?</q>
Luke 8:46 And Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive <transChange>a peculiar</transChange> virtue is gone out of me.</q>
Luke 8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not concealed, she came trembling, and fell down to Him, and declared before all the people, for what reason she <transChange>had</transChange> touched Him, and how she was healed immediately.
Luke 8:48 And He said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Daughter, be comforted, thy faith has healed thee, go in peace.)</q>
Luke 8:49 While He was yet speaking, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's, and said to Him, Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.
Luke 8:50 But Jesus hearing <transChange>it,</transChange> answered saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Fear not, only believe, and she shall be recovered.</q>
Luke 8:51 And when He came to the house, He suffered none to go in but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.
Luke 8:52 And they were all weeping and bewailing her: but He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</q>
Luke 8:53 And they laughed at Him, knowing that she was dead.
Luke 8:54 But He turned <transChange>them</transChange> all out, and taking hold of her hand, called <transChange>to her,</transChange> saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Child, arise.</q>
Luke 8:55 And her spirit returned, and immediately she stood up: and He ordered <transChange>something</transChange> to be given her to eat.
Luke 8:56 And her parents were <transChange>exceedingly</transChange> astonished: but He charged them to tell no one what was done. <chapter eID="gen2156" osisID="Luke.8"/>
Luke 9:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.9" sID="gen2213"/>
Luke 9:1 And He called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases:
Luke 9:2 and He sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
Luke 9:3 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take nothing for <transChange>your</transChange> journey, neither staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; nor two coats a piece.</q>
Luke 9:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And into whatever house ye enter, continue there, till ye leave that place.</q>
Luke 9:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And whosoever will not receive you, when ye depart from that city, shake off the very dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.</q>
Luke 9:6 And they went from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing every where.
Luke 9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all <transChange>the things</transChange> that were done by Him; and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John was risen from the dead;
Luke 9:8 and by some that Elias had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.
Luke 9:9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such <transChange>things?</transChange> and he wanted to see Him.
Luke 9:10 And the apostles; when they were returned, told Him all that they had done: and He took them and retired privately into a desert place belonging to the city Bethsaida.
Luke 9:11 But when the people knew it they followed Him; and He received them, and spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those that had need of a cure.
Luke 9:12 And when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to Him, Dismiss the people, that they may go into the villages and country-places round about, and bait, and get food: for here we are in a desert place.
Luke 9:13 But He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye give them food.</q> And they said, We have but five loaves and two fishes: unless we should go and buy provisions for all this people:
Luke 9:14 for they were about five thousand men. And He said to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Make them sit down <transChange>in</transChange> companies by fifty.</q>
Luke 9:15 And they did so, and caused them all to sit down.
Luke 9:16 And He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven He blessed them; and brake and gave <transChange>them</transChange> to the disciples to set before the multitude.
Luke 9:17 And they did eat, and were all satisfied: and there was taken up what remained <transChange>even</transChange> of fragments twelve baskets.
Luke 9:18 And it came to pass, as He was praying in private, his disciples were with Him: and He asked them saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whom say the people that I am?</q>
Luke 9:19 They answering said, John the baptist: but others <transChange>say</transChange> Elias: and others, that some ancient prophet is risen again.
Luke 9:20 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">But whom say ye that I am?</q> And Peter answered and said, The Christ <transChange>the Son</transChange> of God.
Luke 9:21 But He strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,
Luke 9:22 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man must suffer many <transChange>things,</transChange> and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised <transChange>again</transChange> the third day.</q>
Luke 9:23 And He said unto <transChange>them</transChange> all, <q marker="" who="Jesus">if any one is willing to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me:</q>
Luke 9:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for he that would save his life shall lose it, but he that would lose his life for my sake shall save it.</q>
Luke 9:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be destroyed?</q>
Luke 9:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when He comes in his <transChange>own</transChange> glory, and <transChange>in his</transChange> Father's, and of the holy angels.</q>
Luke 9:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I assure you, there be some of those who stand here, that shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God.</q>
Luke 9:28 About eight days after these discourses, He took Peter, and John, and James, and went up to a mountain to pray.
Luke 9:29 And as He was praying the form of his countenance was altered, and his raiment white <transChange>and</transChange> glistering:
Luke 9:30 and behold two men talked with Him, which were Moses and Elias;
Luke 9:31 who appeared in glory, and spake of his exit, which He was to make at Jerusalem.
Luke 9:32 Now Peter and they that were with Him were heavy with sleep; but being awakened they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with Him.
Luke 9:33 And as they were departing from Him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
Luke 9:34 And as he was saying this, there came a cloud and overshadowed them; and they were afraid, when they went <transChange>up</transChange> into the cloud <transChange>and disappeared.</transChange>
Luke 9:35 And there came a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.
Luke 9:36 And when the voice was <transChange>uttered,</transChange> Jesus was found alone. And they kept <transChange>it</transChange> to themselves, and told no one at that time any of the things which they had seen.
Luke 9:37 And the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met Him:
Luke 9:38 and one of the people cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee look upon my son, for he is my only child;
Luke 9:39 and lo, a spirit seizeth him, and <transChange>all</transChange> on a sudden he screameth, and it convulses him with foaming; and bruising him, with much ado departs from him.
Luke 9:40 And I prayed thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
Luke 9:41 Then Jesus answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.</q>
Luke 9:42 And as he was coming along, the devil bruised and convulsed him: but Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him to his father.
Luke 9:43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God: but while they were all wondering at <transChange>the things</transChange> which Jesus did, He said to his disciples,
Luke 9:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Receive these words into your ears; for the Son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.</q>
Luke 9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, <transChange>so</transChange> that they perceived it not, and they were afraid to ask Him concerning it.
Luke 9:46 Then a dispute rose among them, which of them should be greatest.
Luke 9:47 And Jesus knowing the thought of their heart, took a child and set him by Him, and said unto them,
Luke 9:48 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whosoever shall receive this little child for my sake, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me. For he that is lest among you all, shall be great.</q>
Luke 9:49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he followeth not <transChange>thee</transChange> with us.
Luke 9:50 And Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Forbid <transChange>him</transChange> not; for he, that is not against us, is for us.</q>
Luke 9:51 And it came to pass, as the days were <transChange>almost</transChange> fulfilled of his being received up again <transChange>into heaven,</transChange> that He set his face to go to Jerusalem,
Luke 9:52 and sent messengers before Him: who went into a village of the Samaritans to get <transChange>a place</transChange> ready for Him.
Luke 9:53 But they would not entertain Him, because his face was towards Jerusalem.
Luke 9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw <transChange>it,</transChange> they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, as Elias did?
Luke 9:55 But He turned and rebuked them, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye know not what spirit ye are of:</q>
Luke 9:56 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for the Son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but to save <transChange>them.</transChange> And they went to another village.</q>
Luke 9:57 And as they were going by the way, <transChange>there was</transChange> one said to Him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest:
Luke 9:58 and Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The foxes have holes, and the fowls of heaven <transChange>their</transChange> nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</q>
Luke 9:59 And He said to another, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Follow me:</q> but he said, Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father:
Luke 9:60 but Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</q>
Luke 9:61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee, but allow me first to <transChange>go and</transChange> take <transChange>my</transChange> leave of my family.
Luke 9:62 But Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">No one, that hath put his hand to the plough and looketh back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</q> <chapter eID="gen2213" osisID="Luke.9"/>

Luke 10:1 After these things the Lord appointed also seventy others, and sent them two and two before Him, into every city and place, whither <transChange>He</transChange> himself was about to come.
Luke 10:2 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers <transChange>are</transChange> few: pray therefore <transChange>to</transChange> the Lord of the harvest, that He would send out workmen to his harvest.</q>

Luke 10:21 At <transChange>this</transChange> time Jesus was transported with joy in <transChange>his</transChange> spirit and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I thank thee, <transChange>O</transChange> Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these <transChange>things</transChange> from the wise and knowing, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father, for such was thy good pleasure.</q>
Luke 10:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">All <transChange>things</transChange> are delivered to me by my Father: and none knoweth who the Son is, but the Father: and who the Father is, but the Son; and he to whom the Son pleaseth to reveal <transChange>Him.</transChange></q>
Luke 10:23 And turning to the disciples, He said to them in particular, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Blessed are the eyes that see what ye see:</q>

Luke 10:27 And he answered, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbor as thyself.
Luke 10:28 And He said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou hast answered right; do this and thou shalt live.</q>
Luke 10:29 But he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
Luke 10:30 And Jesus replying said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">There was a certain man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among thieves, who after they had stripped and beaten him, went away, leaving him half dead.</q>
Luke 10:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And by chance a certain priest came down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</q>

Luke 10:38 And as they were journeying, He entered into a certain village; and a woman named Martha received Him into her house.
Luke 10:39 And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, attending to his discourse.

Luke 11:1 And as He was praying in a certain <transChange>retired</transChange> place, as soon as He had done, one of his disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.

Luke 11:15 But some of them said, He casteth out demons by Beelzebub the prince of demons:
Luke 11:16 and others, to try Him, desired of Him a sign from heaven.
Luke 11:17 But He who <transChange>well</transChange> knew their thoughts, said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and a house against a house falleth: if Satan also be divided against himself,</q>

Luke 11:39 But the Lord said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">ye pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness.</q>
Luke 11:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Senseless <transChange>creatures!</transChange> Did not He who made the outside, make also that which is within? give alms rather according to your ability:</q>
Luke 11:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and behold all <transChange>things</transChange> are clean to you.</q>
Luke 11:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But wo unto you pharisees, who tithe <transChange>even your</transChange> mint, and rue, and all <transChange>your</transChange> herbs, and pass by judgement and the love of God: these ought ye to practise and not to omit the others.</q>
Luke 11:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo unto you pharisees; for ye love the chief seat in synagogues, and salutations in public places.</q>
Luke 11:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo unto you scribes and pharisees, hypocrites; for ye are like graves that do not appear, and those that walk over <transChange>them</transChange> are not aware <transChange>of them.</transChange></q>
Luke 11:45 And one of the doctors of the law answered and said unto Him, Master, <transChange>in</transChange> saying these <transChange>things</transChange> thou reproachest us also.
Luke 11:46 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo unto you also, ye interpreters of the law, for ye load men with insupportable burthens, and ye yourselves touch not the burthens with one of your fingers.</q>
Luke 11:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wo unto you; who build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</q>

Luke 11:53 As He was saying these <transChange>things</transChange> unto them the scribes and pharisees began vehemently to attack Him, and urge Him to speak of many <transChange>things,</transChange>

Luke 12:16 And He spake a parable to them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</q>
Luke 12:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do? for I have not <transChange>room</transChange> to lay up my corn.</q>
Luke 12:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he said, This I will do: I will pull down my barns, and build larger <transChange>ones;</transChange> and there I will bestow all my products and my goods.</q>

Luke 13:18 Then said He, <q marker="" who="Jesus">To what is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?</q>
Luke 13:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in it's boughs.</q>
Luke 13:20 And again He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</q>
Luke 13:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is like leaven, which a woman took and put into three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</q>
Luke 13:22 And he went through the cities and villages teaching, as He journeyed towards Jerusalem.
Luke 13:23 And one said to Him, Lord, <transChange>are</transChange> there <transChange>but</transChange> few <transChange>that shall be</transChange> saved?
Luke 13:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But He said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for I tell you, many will desire to enter in, and shall not be able.</q>

Luke 13:31 At the same time came some <transChange>of the</transChange> pharisees, and said to Him, Go out and depart hence, for Herod intends to kill thee.
Luke 13:32 And He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and to-morrow; and in a little while I am <transChange>to be</transChange> perfected:</q>

Luke 14:1 And as He went into the house of one of the chief of the pharisees to eat on the sabbath-<transChange>day,</transChange> and they were watching Him,
Luke 14:2 behold, there was a certain man before Him that had a dropsy.
Luke 14:3 And Jesus spake to the expounders of the law and <transChange>to the</transChange> pharisees, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath-<transChange>day?</transChange></q>
Luke 14:4 but they made no answer. And He took <transChange>him</transChange> and healed him, and sent <transChange>him</transChange> away:

Luke 14:6 and they were not able to answer Him again to these <transChange>things.</transChange>
Luke 14:7 And He spake a parable to those that were invited, observing how they chose the chief seats, saying unto them,
Luke 14:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">When thou art invited by any <transChange>one</transChange> to a wedding, do not sit down in the uppermost place, least <transChange>one</transChange> more honorable than thou be invited by him;</q>

Luke 14:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when thou art invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, that, when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then wilt thou have honor before them that sit at table with thee:</q>
Luke 14:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for whosoever exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</q>
Luke 14:12 He said also to him that had invited Him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">When thou makest a dinner or a supper, do not invite thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kindred, nor <transChange>thy</transChange> rich neighbors; least they invite thee again, and <transChange>so</transChange> a return be made thee.</q>
Luke 14:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind; and thou shalt be happy;</q>

Luke 14:15 And one of those; who sat at table with <transChange>Him,</transChange> hearing these <transChange>things,</transChange> said unto Him, Happy <transChange>is</transChange> he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
Luke 14:16 Upon which He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">A certain man made a great supper and invited many;</q>
Luke 14:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and sent his servant at supper-time to say to them that were invited, Come, for all <transChange>things</transChange> are now ready.</q>
Luke 14:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And they all with one <transChange>consent</transChange> began to make excuses; the first said, I have bought a field, and I must go and see it, pray have me excused.</q>

Luke 14:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">So the servant came and told his lord these <transChange>things.</transChange> Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go directly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind.</q>
Luke 14:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And the servant said, Sir, it is done according to thine order, and still there is room.</q>

Luke 14:25 Now there were great multitudes going along with Him:

Luke 15:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger?</q>

Luke 18:2 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">There was a judge in a certain city, who neither feared God, nor regarded man.</q>
Luke 18:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And there was a widow in that city, who came to him, saying, Do me justice of my adversary.</q>
Luke 18:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he would not for a time: but afterwards he said within himself, Though I fear not God,</q>
Luke 18:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">nor regard man, <transChange>yet</transChange> because this widow gives me trouble, I will do her justice, least <transChange>by</transChange> continually coming she weary me out.</q>
Luke 18:6 And the Lord said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">hear what <transChange>even</transChange> the unjust judge saith:</q>
Luke 18:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and will not God do justice for his elect that cry to Him day and night, though He bear long with them.</q>
Luke 18:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I tell you, He will avenge them speedily. And yet when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith in the land?</q>
Luke 18:9 And He spake also this parable to some that trusted in themselves as being righteous, and despised others.
Luke 18:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one a pharisee and the other a publican.</q>
Luke 18:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The pharisee standing by himself prayed thus, O God, I thank thee that I am not as other men <transChange>are,</transChange> rapacious, unjust, adulterous, or even as this publican.</q>
Luke 18:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I fast twice a week, <transChange>and</transChange> I give tithes of all that I possess.</q>
Luke 18:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But the publican standing at a distance did not presume so much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, be merciful to me a sinner.</q>
Luke 18:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I tell you, this <transChange>man</transChange> went down to his house justified <transChange>rather</transChange> than the other: for whoever exalteth himself shall be abased, but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</q>
Luke 18:15 And they brought to Him infants also, that He might touch them: and <transChange>his</transChange> disciples seeing <transChange>it</transChange> rebuked them.
Luke 18:16 But Jesus called them to <transChange>Him</transChange> and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</q>
Luke 18:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall by no means enter into it.</q>
Luke 18:18 And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke 18:19 And Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why callest thou me good? <transChange>there is</transChange> none good but one, <transChange>that is</transChange> God.</q>
Luke 18:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</q>
Luke 18:21 And he said, all these have I kept from my youth.
Luke 18:22 But when Jesus heard these <transChange>things</transChange> He said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou yet wantest one <transChange>thing,</transChange> Sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</q>
Luke 18:23 But when he heard this, he was very sorrowful; for he was very rich.
Luke 18:24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God?</q>
Luke 18:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</q>
Luke 18:26 And they that heard <transChange>it</transChange> said, Who then can be saved?
Luke 18:27 But He answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>Things</transChange> impossible with men are possible with God.</q>
Luke 18:28 Then said Peter, Behold, we have quitted all, and followed Thee.
Luke 18:29 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, there is no one that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</q>
Luke 18:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">who shall not receive manifold more <transChange>even</transChange> in this life, and in the world to come life everlasting.</q>
Luke 18:31 And He took the twelve with <transChange>Him</transChange> and said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all <transChange>things</transChange> written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</q>
Luke 18:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For He shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and insulted, and abused, and spit upon, and they will scourge <transChange>Him,</transChange> and put Him to death:</q>
Luke 18:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and the third day He shall rise again.</q>
Luke 18:34 But they understood none of these <transChange>things;</transChange> and this matter was hid from them, so that they knew not the things <transChange>which were</transChange> spoken.
Luke 18:35 And as he was near to Jericho, a certain blind <transChange>man</transChange> sat by the way-side begging.
Luke 18:36 And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant.
Luke 18:37 And they told him, Jesus of Nazareth is coming by.
Luke 18:38 And he cried out, saying, Jesus, <transChange>thou</transChange> son of David, have compassion on me.
Luke 18:39 And they, that went before, rebuked him, that he might hold his peace, but he cried out the more, O Son of David, have pity on me.
Luke 18:40 So Jesus stopt, and ordered him to be brought to Him: and when he was come near,
Luke 18:41 He asked him, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What wouldst thou <transChange>that</transChange> I should do for thee?</q> And he said, Lord, that I may recover <transChange>my</transChange> sight.
Luke 18:42 And Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Receive <transChange>thy</transChange> sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</q>
Luke 18:43 And immediately he received <transChange>his</transChange> sight, and followed Him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. <chapter eID="gen2609" osisID="Luke.18"/>
Luke 19:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.19" sID="gen2653"/>
Luke 19:1 And Jesus having entred Jericho passed through <transChange>the city,</transChange>
Luke 19:2 and behold, <transChange>there was</transChange> a man named Zaccheus, who was <transChange>the</transChange> chief publican, and <transChange>very</transChange> rich.
Luke 19:3 And he sought to see Jesus who He was; but he could not for the croud; for he was little of stature.
Luke 19:4 And he ran before and got up into a sycamore-tree that he might see Him; for He was to pass by that way.
Luke 19:5 And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Zaccheus, make haste and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.</q>
Luke 19:6 And he made haste and came down, and received Him with joy.
Luke 19:7 And when they saw <transChange>it,</transChange> they all murmured, saying, He is gone to be guest with a wicked man.
Luke 19:8 But Zaccheus stood <transChange>up</transChange> and said unto Jesus, Behold, Lord, the half of my substance I give to the poor; and if I have taken any <transChange>thing</transChange> from any <transChange>one</transChange> wrongfully, I restore <transChange>him</transChange> fourfold.
Luke 19:9 Then said Jesus, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This day is salvation <transChange>come</transChange> to this house, for as much as he also is a son of Abraham.</q>
Luke 19:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</q>
Luke 19:11 And as they listened to these <transChange>things,</transChange> He proceeded and spake a parable; because He was nigh to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately be manifested.
Luke 19:12 He said therefore, <q marker="" who="Jesus">A certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive <transChange>the investiture</transChange> of a kingdom and <transChange>then</transChange> to return.</q>
Luke 19:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he called ten <transChange>of</transChange> his servants, and delivered to them ten pounds, and said, Trade <transChange>with them</transChange> till I come.</q>
Luke 19:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this <transChange>man</transChange> to reign over us.</q>
Luke 19:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when he was returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to be called to him, to whom he had delivered the money, that he might know what use each had made <transChange>of it.</transChange></q>
Luke 19:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then came the first and said, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</q>
Luke 19:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he said to him, Well <transChange>done, thou</transChange> good servant, as thou hast been faithful in a very little, thou shalt be governor over ten cities.</q>
Luke 19:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath produced five pounds:</q>
Luke 19:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and he said to this likewise, Be thou also over five cities.</q>
Luke 19:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And another came, and said, Behold, <transChange>my</transChange> Lord, thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</q>
Luke 19:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man, <transChange>who</transChange> takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.</q>
Luke 19:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But he said to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, <transChange>thou</transChange> wicked servant, Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow;</q>
Luke 19:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and why <transChange>then</transChange> didst thou not put my money into the bank, that when I came I might have received it with interest?</q>
Luke 19:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he said to them that stood by, Take away the pound from him, and give it to him that hath the ten pounds.</q>
Luke 19:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds <transChange>already:</transChange>)</q>
Luke 19:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for I tell you, that to every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even what he <transChange>seemingly</transChange> hath shall be taken away.</q>
Luke 19:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But those mine enemies, who would not have me to reign over them, bring hither, and slay <transChange>them</transChange> before me.</q>
Luke 19:28 And when He had said these things, He went forward, going up to Jerusalem.
Luke 19:29 And when He was nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called <transChange>the mount</transChange> of Olives, He sent two of his disciples,
Luke 19:30 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go into the opposite village, in which, <transChange>at your</transChange> entring, ye will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat; loose him and bring <transChange>him hither.</transChange></q>
Luke 19:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose <transChange>him?</transChange> thus shall ye say unto him, The Lord hath need of him.</q>
Luke 19:32 And they that were sent, went away and found <transChange>it</transChange> as He had told them.
Luke 19:33 But as they were untying the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why do ye untie the colt?
Luke 19:34 and they answered, The Lord hath need of him.
Luke 19:35 And they brought him to Jesus: and throwing their garments upon the colt they set Jesus thereon.
Luke 19:36 And as He went along they spread their clothes under <transChange>Him</transChange> in the way.
Luke 19:37 And when He was now come near to the foot of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples rejoicing began to praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
Luke 19:38 saying, Blessed <transChange>be</transChange> the king that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!
Luke 19:39 And some of the pharisees from <transChange>among</transChange> the multitude said to Him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
Luke 19:40 And He answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I tell you, that if these were silent, the <transChange>very</transChange> stones would cry out.</q>
Luke 19:41 And as He drew near, beholding the city, He wept over it,
Luke 19:42 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If thou hadst known, even thou, at lest in this thy day, the things <transChange>relating</transChange> to thy peace--- but now they are hid from thine eyes.</q>
Luke 19:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast up a trench about thee, and surround thee, and keep thee in on every side,</q>
Luke 19:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and shall lay thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou didst not regard the time of thy visitation.</q>
Luke 19:45 And He went into the temple, and cast out those that were buying and selling in it,
Luke 19:46 saying unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is written, "my house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."</q>
Luke 19:47 And He was teaching daily in the temple: but the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy Him;
Luke 19:48 and could not find how to effect it: for all the people were attentive to hear Him. <chapter eID="gen2653" osisID="Luke.19"/>
Luke 20:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.20" sID="gen2702"/>
Luke 20:1 And on one of those days as He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes and elders came upon Him, saying,
Luke 20:2 Tell us by what authority thou dost these things? or who <transChange>it</transChange> is that gave thee this authority?
Luke 20:3 And He answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I will also ask you one question, tell me,</q>
Luke 20:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?</q>
Luke 20:5 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
Luke 20:6 but if we say, Of men, the people will all stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
Luke 20:7 And they answered, <transChange>they</transChange> did not know whence <transChange>it was.</transChange>
Luke 20:8 And Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these <transChange>things.</transChange></q>
Luke 20:9 Then He began to speak unto the people this parable, <q marker="" who="Jesus">A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen and travelled abroad for a considerable time,</q>
Luke 20:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and at the <transChange>fruit</transChange>-season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen beat him and sent <transChange>him</transChange> away empty.</q>
Luke 20:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he sent another servant; and they beat him also and abused <transChange>him,</transChange> and sent <transChange>him</transChange> away empty.</q>
Luke 20:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he sent a third; and they wounded him also and drove him out.</q>
Luke 20:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: perhaps when they see Him they will reverence <transChange>Him.</transChange></q>
Luke 20:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when the husbandmen saw Him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</q>
Luke 20:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed <transChange>him.</transChange> What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</q>
Luke 20:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.</q> And when they heard <transChange>this</transChange> they said, God forbid.
Luke 20:17 And He looked upon them and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What then is this, <transChange>which is</transChange> written, The stone which the builders refused, is become the head of the corner?</q>
Luke 20:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whosoever falleth on that stone shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it falleth, it will crush him to pieces.</q>
Luke 20:19 And the chief priests and the scribes would have laid hands on Him at <transChange>that</transChange> very time, but were afraid of the people: for they perceived that He had spoken this parable against them.
Luke 20:20 And they watched <transChange>Him</transChange> and sent out spies, pretending to be righteous <transChange>men,</transChange> to lay hold of his words, that they might deliver Him up to the power and authority of the governor.
Luke 20:21 And they asked Him, saying, Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person <transChange>of any,</transChange> but teachest the way of God in truth:
Luke 20:22 is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar, or not?
Luke 20:23 But He perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why do ye tempt me?</q>
Luke 20:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Shew me a penny: whose image and inscription hath it?</q> and they answered, Cesar's.
Luke 20:25 Then said He unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Render therefore unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</q>
Luke 20:26 And they could not take hold of his word before the people: and they marvelled at his answer and said no more.
Luke 20:27 And some of the Sadducees (who deny a resurrection) came to <transChange>Him</transChange> and asked Him,
Luke 20:28 saying, Moses enjoined us, if any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die childless, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
Luke 20:29 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless; and the second took the wife, and he died childless;
Luke 20:30 and the third took her;
Luke 20:31 and in like manner <transChange>all</transChange> the seven.
Luke 20:32 And they died and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.
Luke 20:33 Therefore at the resurrection whose wife is she? for <transChange>all</transChange> the seven had her to wife.
Luke 20:34 And Jesus answering said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The children of this world marry and are given in marriage.</q>
Luke 20:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But they who are counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</q>
Luke 20:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for they can die no more, being like the angels: and they are the children of God <transChange>as</transChange> being the children of the resurrection.</q>
Luke 20:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush; for he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</q>
Luke 20:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for to Him <transChange>they</transChange> are all living.</q>
Luke 20:39 And some of the scribes replied, Master, thou hast <transChange>indeed</transChange> said right.
Luke 20:40 And they dared not any more to ask Him any <transChange>such</transChange> question.
Luke 20:41 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">How do they say, that Christ is the son of David?</q>
Luke 20:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">when David himself saith in the book of Psalms, "The Lord said unto my Lord,</q>
Luke 20:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Sit <transChange>thou</transChange> on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."</q>
Luke 20:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">David therefore calleth Him Lord, and how is He <transChange>then</transChange> his son?</q>
Luke 20:45 And He said to his disciples, in the audience of all the people,
Luke 20:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Beware of the scribes, who affect to walk in long robes, and love salutations in public places, and <transChange>the</transChange> chief seats in the Synagogues, and uppermost places at feasts;</q>
Luke 20:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">who devour widows houses, and for a shew <transChange>of religion</transChange> make long prayers: these shall receive a heavier sentence.</q> <chapter eID="gen2702" osisID="Luke.20"/>
Luke 21:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.21" sID="gen2750"/>
Luke 21:1 And He looked up and saw the rich <transChange>people</transChange> bringing their gifts to the treasury:
Luke 21:2 and He saw also a poor widow throwing in two mites.
Luke 21:3 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily I tell you, this poor widow hath put in more than <transChange>they</transChange> all.</q>
Luke 21:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For all these <transChange>have</transChange> out of their abundance contributed to the offerings of God: but she out of her penury hath given all she had.</q>
Luke 21:5 And as some were speaking of the temple; how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, He said, <transChange>As for</transChange> these <transChange>things</transChange> which ye see,
Luke 21:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">the days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be demolished.</q>
Luke 21:7 And they asked Him, saying, Master, when shall these <transChange>things</transChange> be? And what <transChange>will be</transChange> the sign when these <transChange>things</transChange> shall come to pass?
Luke 21:8 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take heed that ye be not deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying, I am <transChange>the Christ;</transChange> and the time is near: <transChange>but</transChange> do not therefore go after them.</q>
Luke 21:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these must first happen; but the end <transChange>will</transChange> not <transChange>be</transChange> directly.</q>
Luke 21:10 Then said He unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;</q>
Luke 21:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and there will be great earthquakes in <transChange>several</transChange> places, and famines, and pestilences, and fearful sights and great prodigies from heaven.</q>
Luke 21:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But before all these <transChange>things</transChange> they will lay hands on you, and persecute <transChange>you,</transChange> delivering <transChange>you</transChange> up to synagogues, and prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake:</q>
Luke 21:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but it shall be for a testimony to you.</q>
Luke 21:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Fix <transChange>it</transChange> therefore in your hearts not to premeditate a defence: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom,</q>
Luke 21:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">which all your adversaries shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.</q>
Luke 21:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But ye shall be betrayed even by parents, and brethren, and kindred and friends; and <transChange>some</transChange> of you shall they cause to be put to death:</q>
Luke 21:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and ye will be hated by all <transChange>men</transChange> for my sake.</q>
Luke 21:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But not an hair of your head shall perish.</q>
Luke 21:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">In your patience <transChange>therefore</transChange> possess your souls.</q>
Luke 21:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when ye shall see Jerusalem surrounded with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh: then let them <transChange>that are</transChange> in Judea flee to the mountains,</q>

Luke 21:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And there shall be signs in the sun, and <transChange>in the</transChange> moon, and <transChange>in the</transChange> stars; and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity, the sea and the waves roring:</q>
Luke 21:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>and</transChange> men ready to die for fear and apprehension of the things that are coming upon the land; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</q>
Luke 21:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And then shall they see the Son of man coming, <transChange>as</transChange> on a cloud, with power and great glory.</q>
Luke 21:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But when these things begin to come to pass, look upwards and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</q>
Luke 21:29 And He spake a parable to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold the fig-tree,</q>

Luke 22:2 And the chief priests and scribes were consulting how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.
Luke 22:3 Then entred Satan into Judas <transChange>who was</transChange> surnamed Iscariot, <transChange>one</transChange> of the twelve.
Luke 22:4 And he went and conferred with the chief priests and the captains, how he might betray Him unto them.
Luke 22:5 And they were glad and agreed to give him money:
Luke 22:6 and he accepted <transChange>the terms,</transChange> and sought an opportunity to betray Him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
Luke 22:7 The day of unleavened bread being come, on which the paschal-lamb was to be slain,
Luke 22:8 <transChange>Jesus</transChange> sent Peter and John, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat <transChange>of it.</transChange></q>
Luke 22:9 And they said unto Him, Where wouldst thou have us prepare <transChange>it?</transChange>
Luke 22:10 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold, when ye are come into the city, there shall meet you a man, carrying a pitcher of water, follow him into the house where he entreth:</q>
Luke 22:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and say to the master of the house, <transChange>Our</transChange> Master inquireth <transChange>by us,</transChange> Where is the room, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?</q>
Luke 22:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he will shew you a large upper room set out; there make <transChange>it</transChange> ready.</q>
Luke 22:13 And they went and found as He had told them; and prepared the passover.
Luke 22:14 And when the hour was come, He sat down and the twelve apostles with Him.
Luke 22:15 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I have earnestly desired to eat of this passover with you before I suffer:</q>
Luke 22:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for I say unto you, that I will not eat of it any more, till it be accomplished in the kingdom of God.</q>
Luke 22:17 And taking the cup He gave thanks and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take this and distribute <transChange>it</transChange> among yourselves.</q>
Luke 22:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For I tell you, that I will not drink <transChange>again</transChange> of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God shall come.</q>
Luke 22:19 And He took bread, and gave thanks and brake <transChange>it,</transChange> and gave <transChange>it</transChange> to them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This is my body <transChange>which is</transChange> given for you; do this in remembrance of me:</q>
Luke 22:20 as also the cup after supper, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This cup <transChange>represents</transChange> the new covenant in my blood, <transChange>which is</transChange> shed for you.</q>
Luke 22:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me <transChange>is</transChange> at table with me:</q>
Luke 22:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and the Son of man is going indeed as <transChange>was</transChange> determined; but wo to that man by whom He is betrayed.</q>
Luke 22:23 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do it.
Luke 22:24 And there was also a dispute among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest:
Luke 22:25 but He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority are called benefactors.</q>
Luke 22:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But ye <transChange>shall</transChange> not <transChange>do</transChange> so: but let the greatest among you be as the younger; and he that presides as he that serveth.</q>
Luke 22:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? <transChange>is</transChange> not he that sitteth at table? but I am among you as one that serveth.</q>
Luke 22:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye have continued with me in my temptations;</q>
Luke 22:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and I appoint you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me:</q>
Luke 22:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</q>
Luke 22:31 And the Lord said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired <transChange>to have</transChange> you <transChange>my disciples,</transChange> that he may sift <transChange>you</transChange> as wheat:</q>
Luke 22:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</q>
Luke 22:33 And he said unto Him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death.
Luke 22:34 But He replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before thou hast thrice denied that thou knowest me.</q>
Luke 22:35 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">When I sent you forth without purse, or bag, or shoes, did ye want any <transChange>thing?</transChange></q> and they said, Nothing.
Luke 22:36 Then said He unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">But now let him, that hath a purse, take it, and <transChange>his</transChange> bag likewise; and let him that has no sword, sell his garment and buy <transChange>one:</transChange></q>
Luke 22:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for I tell you, that this <transChange>which is</transChange> written must yet be accomplished in me, "And He was numbered with transgressors," for the things <transChange>foretold</transChange> concerning me are <transChange>near at</transChange> an end.</q>
Luke 22:38 And they said, Lord, behold here <transChange>are</transChange> two swords. And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is enough.</q>
Luke 22:39 And He came out and went, as He used to do, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed Him.
Luke 22:40 And when He was at the place, He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</q>
Luke 22:41 And when He was withdrawn from them about a stone's-cast, He kneeled down and prayed saying,
Luke 22:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Father, if thou art willing take away this cup from me---nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.</q>
Luke 22:43 And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven strengthening Him.
Luke 22:44 And being in agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was like clotted blood falling down upon the ground.
Luke 22:45 And when He rose up from prayer, He came to his disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow;
Luke 22:46 and He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why do ye sleep? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</q>
Luke 22:47 And while He was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he <transChange>that was</transChange> called Judas, one of the twelve <transChange>apostles,</transChange> came before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss Him:
Luke 22:48 and Jesus said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</q>
Luke 22:49 But when they <transChange>that were</transChange> about Him saw what would follow, they said to Him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
Luke 22:50 And one of them smote the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear:
Luke 22:51 but Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Suffer ye thus far;</q> and He touched his ear and healed him.
Luke 22:52 Then said Jesus to the chief priests, and officers of the temple, and elders, that were come to Him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?</q>
Luke 22:53 <q marker="" who="Jesus">When I was day after day with you in the temple, ye did not stretch out <transChange>your</transChange> hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</q>
Luke 22:54 Then they took <transChange>Him</transChange> and led Him <transChange>away,</transChange> and brought Him to the high priest's. And Peter followed at a distance.
Luke 22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and sat down together, Peter <transChange>also</transChange> sat down among them:
Luke 22:56 and a <transChange>servant</transChange>-maid seeing him as he sat by the fire, and looking hard at him, said, This <transChange>fellow</transChange> was also with Him:
Luke 22:57 But he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.
Luke 22:58 And after a little <transChange>while</transChange> another <transChange>person</transChange> seeing him said, And thou art <transChange>one</transChange> of them: but Peter said, Man, I am not.
Luke 22:59 And about an hour after, another confidently affirmed saying, In truth this <transChange>fellow</transChange> also was with Him; for he is a Galilean too: but Peter answered,
Luke 22:60 Man, I know not what thou sayst. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crew.
Luke 22:61 And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter called to mind the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Before the cock crow thou wilt deny me thrice.</q>
Luke 22:62 And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Luke 22:63 And the men that laid hold on Jesus, insulted and abused Him;
Luke 22:64 and when they had blind-folded Him, they struck Him on the face, and asked Him, saying, Prophesy who it was that smote thee.
Luke 22:65 And many other things spake they against Him, blaspheming <transChange>Him.</transChange>
Luke 22:66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and chief-priests, and scribes, assembled together, and ordered Him up into their council:
Luke 22:67 and said <transChange>to Him,</transChange> Art thou the Messiah? tell us. And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I should tell you, ye would not believe:</q>
Luke 22:68 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and if I should put <transChange>any</transChange> question <transChange>to you,</transChange> ye would not answer me, nor discharge me.</q>
Luke 22:69 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>But</transChange> hereafter shall the Son of man be seated on the right <transChange>hand</transChange> of the power of God.</q>
Luke 22:70 And they all said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Art thou then the Son of God?</q>
Luke 22:71 And He said unto them, I am. And they said, What need have we of any farther evidence? when we ourselves have <transChange>it</transChange> from his own mouth? <chapter eID="gen2789" osisID="Luke.22"/>
Luke 23:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.23" sID="gen2861"/>
Luke 23:1 Then they all rose up and led Him to Pilate.
Luke 23:2 And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this <transChange>fellow</transChange> perverting the nation, and forbiding to give tribute to Cesar; saying, that He himself is Christ <transChange>the</transChange> king.
Luke 23:3 And Pilate asked Him, saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And He answered him and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>I am as</transChange> thou sayest.</q>
Luke 23:4 But Pilate said to the chief priests, and to the people, I find nothing criminal in this man.
Luke 23:5 Then they were more vehement, saying, He stirreth up the people <transChange>to sedition,</transChange> spreading his doctrine throughout all Judea: having begun at Galilee <transChange>and come</transChange> even to this place.
Luke 23:6 Now when Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked, if the man were a Galilean:
Luke 23:7 and understanding that He was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also at Jerusalem at that time.
Luke 23:8 And Herod, when he saw Jesus, was very glad; for he had of a long <transChange>time</transChange> been desirous to see Him, because he had heard much of Him, and he hoped to see some miracle wrought by Him.
Luke 23:9 And he asked Him many questions; but He answered him nothing:
Luke 23:10 though the chief priests and scribes stood vehemently accusing Him.
Luke 23:11 But Herod with his soldiers set Him at nought and insulted <transChange>Him,</transChange> and put on Him a gaudy robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.
Luke 23:12 And on <transChange>that</transChange> same day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other: for before they were at enmity one with the other.
Luke 23:13 And Pilate called together the chief priests, and the rulers,
Luke 23:14 and the people, and said unto them, Ye have brought to me this man as one that perverteth the people: and behold I have examined <transChange>Him</transChange> before you, and found nothing chargeable on Him, of the things you alledge against Him:
Luke 23:15 nor Herod neither; for I sent you to him, and behold nothing worthy of death is proved upon Him.
Luke 23:16 I will therefore chastise Him, and <transChange>so</transChange> release <transChange>Him.</transChange>
Luke 23:17 Now he was obliged to release one to them at the feast.
Luke 23:18 And they all cried out, saying, Away with this <transChange>man,</transChange> and release to us Barabbas:
Luke 23:19 (who for a riot in the city, and <transChange>for</transChange> murder, was committed to prison:)
Luke 23:20 Pilate therefore spake to <transChange>them</transChange> again, being desirous to release Jesus.
Luke 23:21 But they bawled out, saying, Crucify <transChange>Him,</transChange> crucify Him.
Luke 23:22 And he said to them a third time, what evil hath He done? I have found nothing in Him deserving death: I will therefore chastise Him, and let <transChange>Him</transChange> go.
Luke 23:23 But they insisted upon <transChange>it</transChange> with loud clamours, demanding Him to be crucified: and their voices and <transChange>those</transChange> of the chief priests prevailed.
Luke 23:24 So Pilate gave sentence that what they demanded should be done.
Luke 23:25 And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they desired; and delivered up Jesus to their will.
Luke 23:26 And when they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon a Cyrenean coming out of the country, and put the cross on him to bear it behind Jesus.
Luke 23:27 And there followed Him a great multitude of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented Him: but Jesus turning to them said,
Luke 23:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</q>
Luke 23:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For behold the days are coming in which they shall say, happy <transChange>are</transChange> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.</q>
Luke 23:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Then shall they say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us:</q>
Luke 23:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for if they do these things to the green wood, what shall be done to the dry?</q>
Luke 23:32 And there were also two other malefactors led with Him to be put to death.
Luke 23:33 And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him and the malefactors: one on <transChange>his</transChange> right <transChange>hand</transChange> and the other on <transChange>his</transChange> left.
Luke 23:34 And Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</q> And they parted his garments, and cast lots <transChange>for them.</transChange>
Luke 23:35 And the people stood looking <transChange>on,</transChange> and <transChange>even</transChange> the rulers also with them derided <transChange>Him,</transChange> saying, He saved others, let Him save Himself, if He be the Christ the chosen of God.
Luke 23:36 And the soldiers too insulted Him, coming to <transChange>Him</transChange> and offering Him vinegar, saying,
Luke 23:37 If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.
Luke 23:38 And there was a superscription written over Him in Greek, and Latin and Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Luke 23:39 And one of the malefactors that were executed <transChange>with Him</transChange> reviled Him, saying, If thou be the Messiah, save thyself and us.
Luke 23:40 But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, Dost <transChange>not</transChange> thou fear God neither, when thou <transChange>thyself</transChange> art in the same condemnation?
Luke 23:41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due rewards of our deeds, but this <transChange>man</transChange> hath done nothing amiss.
Luke 23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
Luke 23:43 And Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I assure thee, thou shalt be with me this day in paradise.</q>
Luke 23:44 Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land till the ninth hour.
Luke 23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
Luke 23:46 And Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit.</q> And when He had said thus, He expired.
Luke 23:47 And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.
Luke 23:48 And all the multitudes that came together to this <transChange>affecting</transChange> sight, seeing what happened, smote <transChange>on</transChange> their breasts and returned.
Luke 23:49 And all his acquaintance stood at a distance, and the women that followed Him from Galilee, beholding these <transChange>things.</transChange>
Luke 23:50 And behold <transChange>there was</transChange> a man of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:
Luke 23:51 (who had not consented to <transChange>their</transChange> counsel nor their action; and who was also himself in expectation of the kingdom of God:)
Luke 23:52 he came to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus:
Luke 23:53 and he took it down and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre hewn in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid.
Luke 23:54 Now <transChange>that</transChange> day was the preparation, and the sabbath was coming on:
Luke 23:55 wherefore the women, that came with Him from Galilee, followed <transChange>Joseph,</transChange> and saw the sepulchre, and how the body was laid:
Luke 23:56 but returned and prepared spices and perfumes; and <transChange>then</transChange> rested <transChange>on</transChange> the sabbath-<transChange>day,</transChange> according to the commandment. <chapter eID="gen2861" osisID="Luke.23"/>
Luke 24:0 <chapter osisID="Luke.24" sID="gen2918"/>
Luke 24:1 And on the first <transChange>day</transChange> of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; (and some <transChange>others</transChange> with them:) and found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre:
Luke 24:2 so they went in,
Luke 24:3 but found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke 24:4 And while they were in perplexity about it, behold, two men stood by them in shining robes.
Luke 24:5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down <transChange>their</transChange> faces to the ground, <transChange>the men</transChange> said unto them, Why do ye seek the living among the dead?
Luke 24:6 He is not here, He is risen: remember how He spake to you, when He was yet in Galilee,
Luke 24:7 saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified; and the third day rise again.</q>
Luke 24:8 And they remembered his words,
Luke 24:9 and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these <transChange>things</transChange> to the eleven <transChange>apostles,</transChange> and to all the rest.
Luke 24:10 Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <transChange>the mother</transChange> of James, and the other <transChange>women</transChange> with them, that told these things to the apostles:
Luke 24:11 and their words appeared to them as an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
Luke 24:12 But Peter arose and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves: and he went away, wondering in himself at what had happened.
Luke 24:13 And behold two of them were going that day to a village <transChange>about</transChange> threescore furlongs from Jerusalem, called Emmaus.
Luke 24:14 And they were conversing together about all these <transChange>things</transChange> which had happened.
Luke 24:15 And while they were discoursing and reasoning together, Jesus himself drew near and went along with them.
Luke 24:16 But their eyes were <transChange>so</transChange> restrained that they did not know Him.
Luke 24:17 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What subjects <transChange>are</transChange> these, which ye are discoursing of to one another as ye walk, and <transChange>why</transChange> are <transChange>ye</transChange> sorrowful?</q>
Luke 24:18 And one <transChange>of them,</transChange> whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to Him, Art thou only a sojourner at Jerusalem, and hast not heard of the things which have been done there within these <transChange>few</transChange> days?
Luke 24:19 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What <transChange>things?</transChange></q> And they replied, Those concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful <transChange>both</transChange> in work and word before God and all the people:
Luke 24:20 how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.
Luke 24:21 But we hoped that it was He that would have delivered Israel: and besides all this, to-day is the third day since these <transChange>things</transChange> were done.
Luke 24:22 And indeed some women of our company much surprised us: who having been early at the sepulchre,
Luke 24:23 and not finding his body <transChange>there,</transChange> came and said likewise that they had seen a vision of angels, who said He was alive.
Luke 24:24 And some of those <transChange>that were</transChange> with us went to the sepulchre, and found <transChange>it</transChange> so as the women had said: but Him they did not see.
Luke 24:25 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">O <transChange>people</transChange> void of understanding and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.</q>
Luke 24:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Was not the Messiah to suffer these <transChange>things,</transChange> and <transChange>so</transChange> to enter into his glory?</q>
Luke 24:27 And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, He explained to them in all the scriptures <transChange>the things that were spoken</transChange> concerning Himself.
Luke 24:28 And they drew nigh to the village whither they were going: and He made as if He was going farther.
Luke 24:29 And they pressed Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And He went in to tarry with them.
Luke 24:30 And as He sat at table with them, He took bread and blessed <transChange>it,</transChange> and <transChange>then</transChange> brake <transChange>it</transChange> and gave to them.
Luke 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him.
Luke 24:32 And He disappeared from them. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, as He was talking with us by the way, and while He was opening to us the scriptures?
Luke 24:33 And they rose up immediately and returned to Jerusalem; and sound the eleven and others with them assembled together, saying,
Luke 24:34 The Lord is risen indeed, and hath been seen by Simon.
Luke 24:35 <transChange>Then</transChange> these also related what <transChange>had happened</transChange> by the way, and how He became known to them in breaking of bread.
Luke 24:36 And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Peace <transChange>be</transChange> to you.</q>
Luke 24:37 But they being terrified and frighted, thought they saw a spirit.
Luke 24:38 And He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Why are ye troubled? and why do <transChange>such</transChange> thoughts rise in your hearts?</q>
Luke 24:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</q>
Luke 24:40 And when He said this, He shewed them <transChange>his</transChange> hands and feet.
Luke 24:41 But they not yet believing for joy, and being amazed, He said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have ye here any thing to eat?</q>
Luke 24:42 And they gave Him part of a broiled fish and some honey-comb:
Luke 24:43 and He took, and did eat before them.
Luke 24:44 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">These <transChange>are</transChange> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled, <transChange>which are</transChange> written in the law of Moses, and <transChange>in</transChange> the prophets, and Psalms, concerning me.</q>
Luke 24:45 Then He opened their mind, to understand the scriptures:
Luke 24:46 and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">thus it is written, and thus it was necessary that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead <transChange>on</transChange> the third day;</q>
Luke 24:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and that in his name should be preached repentance and remission of sins to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</q>
Luke 24:48 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And ye are witnesses of these <transChange>things:</transChange> and I <transChange>will</transChange> send upon you the promise of my Father;</q>
Luke 24:49 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but do ye continue in the city <transChange>of</transChange> Jerusalem, till ye are endued with power from on high.</q>
Luke 24:50 And He led them out as far as to Bethany: and lifted up his hands and blessed them.
Luke 24:51 And while He was blessing them, He was parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.
Luke 24:52 And they worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
Luke 24:53 And they were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. <chapter eID="gen2918" osisID="Luke.24"/> <div eID="gen1796" osisID="Luke" type="book"/>

John 1:1 <hi type="bold">In</hi> the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.
John 1:3 By Him were all <transChange>things</transChange> made, and without Him was not <transChange>any</transChange> one thing made that was made.
John 1:4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
John 1:5 And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness attained it not.
John 1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name <transChange>was</transChange> John:
John 1:7 this <transChange>man</transChange> came for witness, that he might testify concerning the light, that through him all might believe.
John 1:8 He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of the light.
John 1:9 The true light was <transChange>that</transChange> which enlightneth every man that cometh into the world.
John 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and <transChange>yet</transChange> the world knew Him not:

John 1:12 But as many as received Him, to them granted He the privilege to become the children of God, <transChange>even</transChange> to them that believe on his name;
John 1:13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, <transChange>being</transChange> full of grace and truth: and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.
John 1:15 Of Him did John bare witness, and publicly declared, saying, This was He of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is <transChange>preferred</transChange> before me; for He was before me.
John 1:16 And of his fulness have we all received, even grace for grace.
John 1:17 For the law was given by Moses, <transChange>but</transChange> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ:
John 1:18 <transChange>and though</transChange> no one hath ever seen God, <transChange>or can see Him: yet</transChange> the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, hath made Him known.
John 1:19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?
John 1:20 he confessed, and denied not; but declared openly, I am not the Christ.
John 1:21 And they asked him, What then? art thou Elias? And he said, I am not. Art thou a prophet? and he answered, No.
John 1:22 Therefore said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us: What dost thou say of thy self?
John 1:23 <transChange>and</transChange> he said, I <transChange>am</transChange> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Make straight the way of the Lord," according to Esaias the prophet.
John 1:24 Now they that were sent, were of the pharisees:
John 1:25 and they asked him, and said to him, Why then dost thou baptize, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor a prophet?
John 1:26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth <transChange>one</transChange> among you, whom ye know not;
John 1:27 that cometh after me, <transChange>but</transChange> is preferred before me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.
John 1:28 These things passed at Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John 1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming towards him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
John 1:30 This is <transChange>He</transChange> of whom I said, After me cometh a man, who is preferred before me: for He was before me.
John 1:31 And I knew Him not: but therefore came I baptizing with water, that He might be made known to Israel.
John 1:32 And John testified saying, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and <transChange>it</transChange> abode upon Him.
John 1:33 And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him, the same is he that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.
John 1:34 And I saw <transChange>it,</transChange> and <transChange>therefore</transChange> testified that this is the Son of God.
John 1:35 The day following John was standing, (and two of his disciples,)
John 1:36 and looking upon Jesus as He was walking, he saith, "Behold the lamb of God."
John 1:37 And when the two disciples heard what he said, they followed Jesus.
John 1:38 And Jesus turning, and seeing them following <transChange>Him,</transChange> saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What do ye seek?</q> They said unto Him, Rabbi (that is to say, Master,) where is thine abode?
John 1:39 He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Come and see.</q> <transChange>And</transChange> they came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.
John 1:40 <transChange>Now</transChange> Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two that heard <transChange>what</transChange> John <transChange>said,</transChange> and <transChange>thereupon</transChange> followed Jesus.
John 1:41 He first meeteth with his own brother Simon, and telleth him, "We have found the Messiah, which is to say, the Christ."
John 1:42 And <transChange>Andrew</transChange> brought him to Jesus: and Jesus looking at him said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou art Simon the son of Jonas, thou shalt be called Cephas; which is interpreted a stone.</q>
John 1:43 The day following Jesus had a mind to go out into Galilee, and meeting with Philip, saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Follow me.</q>
John 1:44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter.
John 1:45 Philip meeting Nathaniel, saith unto him, We have found <transChange>Him,</transChange> of whom Moses in the law, and <transChange>of whom</transChange> the prophets <transChange>also</transChange> wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Jeseph.
John 1:46 And Nathaniel said unto him, Can any <transChange>thing</transChange> good come out of Nazareth? Philip replied, Come and see.
John 1:47 <transChange>And</transChange> when Jesus saw Nathaniel coming towards Him, He saith concerning him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."</q>
John 1:48 Nathaniel saith unto Him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Before Philip called thee, I saw thee, when under the fig-tree.</q>
John 1:49 Nathaniel replied, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the king of Israel.
John 1:50 Jesus answered and said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Because I told thee <transChange>that</transChange> I saw thee under the fig-tree, thou believest: thou shalt see greater <transChange>things</transChange> than these.</q>
John 1:51 And He saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily verily I say unto you, Ye shall hereafter see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</q> <chapter eID="gen2973" osisID="John.1"/>
John 2:0 <chapter osisID="John.2" sID="gen3025"/>
John 2:1 And <transChange>on</transChange> the third day <transChange>after,</transChange> there was a marriage at Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.
John 2:2 And Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.
John 2:3 And the wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith unto Him, They have no wine.
John 2:4 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Woman, what have I to do with thee? my time is not yet come.</q>
John 2:5 His mother saith to the servants, Whatsoever he ordereth you <transChange>to do,</transChange> do <transChange>it.</transChange>
John 2:6 And there were six stone waterpots, placed according to the custom of purifying among the Jews, containing each about two or three firkins.
John 2:7 Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Fill the water-pots with water:</q> and they filled them up to the brim.
John 2:8 And he saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Draw out now, and carry <transChange>it</transChange> to the master of the feast.</q> And they carried <transChange>it to him.</transChange>
John 2:9 And when the manager of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants, that drew the water, knew,) he called the bride-groom,
John 2:10 and saith unto him, Every man sets <transChange>out</transChange> good wine at first, and when they have drank plentifully, then <transChange>that which is</transChange> worse; <transChange>but</transChange> thou hast keep the good wine till now.
John 2:11 This beginning of <transChange>his</transChange> miracles Jesus wrought at Cana of Galilee, and made manifest his glory: and his disciples believed on Him.
John 2:12 After this He went down to Capernaum, He and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: but they staid there not many days.
John 2:13 For the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And He found in the temple those that sold oxen,
John 2:14 and sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting:
John 2:15 and having made a whip of small cords He drove <transChange>them</transChange> all, out of the temple; with the sheep and the oxen: and He poured out the changers money, and threw down the tables.
John 2:16 And said to them that sold doves, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take away these <transChange>things</transChange> from hence, and make not my Father's house an house of traffick.</q>
John 2:17 And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
John 2:18 The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him, What sign dost thou shew us, seeing thou dost these <transChange>things?</transChange>
John 2:19 Jesus answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up <transChange>again:</transChange></q> then said the Jews,
John 2:20 Forty and six years has this temple been <transChange>in</transChange> building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? but He spake of the temple of his body.
John 2:21 Therefore when he was risen from the dead,
John 2:22 his disciples remembered, that He <transChange>had</transChange> said this to them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus <transChange>had</transChange> said.
John 2:23 And when he was in Jerusalem at the passover on the feast-<transChange>day,</transChange> many believed in his name, seeing his miracles, which He wrought.
John 2:24 But Jesus did not trust Himself to them;
John 2:25 for He knew all <transChange>men,</transChange> and He had no need that any should testify concerning man; for He knew what was in man. <chapter eID="gen3025" osisID="John.2"/>
John 3:0 <chapter osisID="John.3" sID="gen3051"/>
John 3:1 Now there was a man of the pharisees, whose name <transChange>was</transChange> Nicodemus, a ruler among the Jews:
John 3:2 who came to Jesus by night, and said unto Him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for none can do these miracles which thou dost, unless God be with him.
John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily verily I tell thee, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</q>
John 3:4 Nicodemus saith unto Him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
John 3:5 Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I tell thee of a truth, Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</q>
John 3:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">That, which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that, which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</q>
John 3:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do not wonder that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</q>
John 3:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>As</transChange> the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound of it, but knowest not whence it cometh, or whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</q>
John 3:9 Nicodemus answered and said unto Him, How can these <transChange>things</transChange> be?
John 3:10 Jesus answered and said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not these <transChange>things?</transChange></q>
John 3:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I assure thee, that we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; though ye receive not our testimony.</q>
John 3:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I have told you earthly <transChange>things</transChange> and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I should tell you heavenly <transChange>ones?</transChange></q>
John 3:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For no one hath ascended up into heaven, but He that came down from heaven, <transChange>even</transChange> the Son of man who is in heaven.</q>
John 3:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up:</q>
John 3:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that whosoever believeth on Him may not perish, but have eternal life.</q>
John 3:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him might not perish, but have everlasting life:</q>
John 3:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved by Him.</q>
John 3:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that believeth on Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is already condemned; because he hath not believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</q>
John 3:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</q>
John 3:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For every one that doth evil, hateth the light; and he cometh not to the light, least his deeds should be reproved.</q>
John 3:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But he that acts <transChange>according to</transChange> truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</q>
John 3:22 After these <transChange>things</transChange> came Jesus, and his disciples into the land of Judea: and He stayed with them there, and baptized.
John 3:23 And John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim; because there was much water there: and <transChange>people</transChange> came to <transChange>him</transChange> and were baptized.
John 3:24 For John was not yet cast into prison.
John 3:25 Now there arose a dispute between <transChange>some</transChange> of the disciples of John, and the Jews, about purifying.
John 3:26 And they came to John, and said unto him, Rabbi, He that was with thee on the other side Jordan, to whom thou barest testimony, behold, He baptizeth and all <transChange>the people</transChange> come to Him.
John 3:27 John answered and said, A man can take nothing <transChange>upon him,</transChange> unless it be given him from heaven.
John 3:28 Ye your selves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but am sent before Him.
John 3:29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with <transChange>great</transChange> joy at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore my joy is complete.
John 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
John 3:31 He, that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and talketh <transChange>like one</transChange> of the earth:
John 3:32 <transChange>but</transChange> He that cometh from heaven, is above all: and what He hath seen and heard, this He testifieth: and <transChange>yet</transChange> scarce any one receiveth his testimony.
John 3:33 He that hath received his testimony, hath set his seal to <transChange>this,</transChange> that God is true:
John 3:34 for He, whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God giveth the Spirit <transChange>to Him</transChange> not by measure.
John 3:35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all into his hand:
John 3:36 <transChange>wherefore</transChange> he that believeth on the Son, hath eternal life; and he that obeyeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. <chapter eID="gen3051" osisID="John.3"/>
John 4:0 <chapter osisID="John.4" sID="gen3088"/>
John 4:1 Therefore when the Lord knew, the pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
John 4:2 (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)
John 4:3 He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
John 4:4 And as He must pass through <transChange>the country of</transChange> Samaria, He came to a Samaritan city called Sichar,
John 4:5 near the piece of ground which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
John 4:6 And Jacob's well was there. Now Jesus was tired with <transChange>his</transChange> journey, and sat down at the well: <transChange>and</transChange> it was about the sixth hour <transChange>of the day,</transChange>
John 4:7 <transChange>when</transChange> a woman of Samaria coming to draw water, Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Give me to drink.</q>
John 4:8 (For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy food.)
John 4:9 But the Samaritan saith unto Him, How is it that thou who art a Jew askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan? for the Jews have no <transChange>friendly</transChange> intercourse with the Samaritans.
John 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.</q>
John 4:11 The woman saith unto Him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?
John 4:12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?
John 4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst again;</q>
John 4:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but he that drinketh of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst: but the water, which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain of water springing up unto eternal life.</q>
John 4:15 The woman saith unto Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.
John 4:16 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go call thine husband, and come hither.</q>
John 4:17 The woman answered, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou hast said right, I have no husband:</q>
John 4:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for thou hast had five husbands; and he, whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: this thou hast said true.</q>
John 4:19 The woman saith unto Him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
John 4:20 Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where <transChange>men</transChange> ought to worship.
John 4:21 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Woman, believe me, the time is coming, when ye shall worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</q>
John 4:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye worship ye know not what; <transChange>but</transChange> we worship what we know: for salvation is from the Jews.</q>
John 4:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But the time is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for the Father requireth such worshippers of Him.</q>
John 4:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">God is a spirit, and they that worship Him, must worship in spirit and truth.</q>
John 4:25 <transChange>Then</transChange> saith the woman unto Him, I know that <transChange>the</transChange> Messiah, that is to say <transChange>the</transChange> Christ, is coming; <transChange>and</transChange> when He comes, He will tell us all <transChange>things.</transChange>
John 4:26 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I, who am talking to thee, am <transChange>He.</transChange></q>
John 4:27 And upon this came his disciples and wondered that He talked with the woman: (though none <transChange>of them</transChange> said, What dost thou seek? or, Why dost thou talk with her?)
John 4:28 therefore the woman left her water-pot, and went away into the city,
John 4:29 and saith to the people, Come, see a man who hath told me all that ever I did; is not this the Christ?
John 4:30 They therefore went out of the city, and came to Him.
John 4:31 In the mean time his disciples addressed Him, saying, Master, eat.
John 4:32 But He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I have food to eat, which ye know not of.</q>
John 4:33 Therefore the disciples said one to another, Hath any one brought Him <transChange>aught</transChange> to eat?
John 4:34 Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My food is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish his work.</q>
John 4:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do not ye say, it is yet four months, and <transChange>then</transChange> cometh harvest? Behold, lift up your eyes, and see the fields, they are already white for harvest.</q>
John 4:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth <transChange>the</transChange> fruit together unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together;</q>
John 4:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for herein the saying is verified, that one soweth, and another reapeth,</q>
John 4:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>in as much as</transChange> I have sent you to reap <transChange>that on</transChange> which ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labors.</q>
John 4:39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on Him, because of what the woman said, testifying, He told me all that ever I did.
John 4:40 Therefore when the Samaritans came to Him, they desired Him to stay with them: and He staid there two days.
John 4:41 And many more believed on account of his own discourse:
John 4:42 and said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what thou hast spoken; for we ourselves have heard <transChange>Him,</transChange> and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
John 4:43 And after two days he departed thence, and went into <transChange>Cana of</transChange> Galilee.
John 4:44 For Jesus himself <transChange>had</transChange> testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
John 4:45 And when He was come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.
John 4:46 Therefore Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine.
John 4:47 And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum: who, when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, went to Him, and intreated Him, that he would come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
John 4:48 Jesus therefore said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.</q>
John 4:49 The nobleman saith unto Him, Lord, come down before my child die.
John 4:50 Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go, thy son is well.</q> And the man believed what Jesus said unto him, and went <transChange>his way.</transChange>
John 4:51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told <transChange>him,</transChange> saying, Thy son is well.
John 4:52 He inquired therefore of them the hour in which he grew better: and they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
John 4:53 So the father knew that <transChange>it was</transChange> in that <transChange>same</transChange> hour, in which Jesus said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thy son is well.</q> And he and his whole family believed.
John 4:54 This <transChange>is</transChange> the second miracle <transChange>that</transChange> Jesus wrought, <transChange>upon</transChange> coming out of Judea into Galilee. <chapter eID="gen3088" osisID="John.4"/>
John 5:0 <chapter osisID="John.5" sID="gen3143"/>
John 5:1 After these <transChange>things</transChange> there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John 5:2 Now there is at Jerusalem near the sheep-<transChange>market</transChange> a pool, called in Hebrew Bethesda, with five porticos <transChange>about it.</transChange>
John 5:3 In these lay a great number of <transChange>people that were</transChange> infirm, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
John 5:4 For an angel descended at a certain season into the pool, and moved the water; the first therefore that went in after the disturbing of the water, was cured of whatever malady he laboured under.
John 5:5 And there was a man who had been under illness thirty eight years.
John 5:6 Jesus seeing him lie <transChange>there,</transChange> and knowing that he had been now a long time <transChange>ill,</transChange> saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Dost thou desire to be cured?</q>
John 5:7 The infirm <transChange>man</transChange> answered Him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is moved, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
John 5:8 Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</q>
John 5:9 And immediately the man was cured: and he took up his bed and walked.
John 5:10 Now this was the sabbath-day, therefore the Jews said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath, it is not lawful for thee to carry <transChange>thy</transChange> bed.
John 5:11 He answered them, He, that made me well, said unto me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take up thy bed and walk.</q>
John 5:12 Therefore they asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take up thy bed and walk?</q>
John 5:13 but he, that was healed, did not know who it was: for Jesus had withdrawn himself, there being many people in the place.
John 5:14 Afterwards Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold, thou art healed; sin no more, least something worse befal thee.</q>
John 5:15 <transChange>And</transChange> the man went away, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had healed him.
John 5:16 And for this did the Jews persecute Jesus, and endeavoured to put Him to death; because He had done these <transChange>things</transChange> on the sabbath-<transChange>day.</transChange>
John 5:17 But Jesus answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My Father worketh without intermission, and <transChange>so</transChange> do I.</q>
John 5:18 For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He had not only broken the sabbath, but had also called God his own Father, making Himself equal with God.
John 5:19 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do: for whatsoever He doth, these also the Son doth in like manner.</q>
John 5:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth Him all <transChange>things,</transChange> which He Himself doth: and He will shew Him greater than these, that ye may wonder.</q>
John 5:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For as the Father raiseth up the dead and giveth life: even so the Son maketh alive whom He pleaseth.</q>
John 5:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For neither doth the Father judge any one, but hath committed all judgement to the Son;</q>
John 5:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that all <transChange>men</transChange> may honour the Son, <transChange>even</transChange> as they honour the Father: he, that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that sent Him.</q>
John 5:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I say unto you, he, that heareth my word, and believeth <transChange>in</transChange> Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come under condemnation; but is passed from death to life.</q>
John 5:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I tell you, that the time is coming, and <transChange>even</transChange> now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</q>
John 5:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself.</q>
John 5:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And hath given Him authority also to execute judgement, because He is the Son of man.</q>
John 5:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wonder not at this; for the time is coming, in which all <transChange>that are</transChange> in the graves shall hear his voice,</q>
John 5:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.</q>
John 5:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I can do nothing of my self: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father that hath sent me.</q>
John 5:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I <transChange>alone</transChange> bear witness of my self, my testimony is not true <transChange>in law:</transChange></q>
John 5:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>but</transChange> there is another who testifieth concerning me; and I know that the testimony, which he giveth concerning me, is true.</q>
John 5:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye <transChange>your selves</transChange> sent unto John, and he bore witness to the truth:</q>
John 5:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">though I need not testimony from man; but I say these <transChange>things</transChange> that ye may be saved.</q>
John 5:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He was <transChange>indeed</transChange> a burning and shining light, and for a while ye willingly rejoiced in his light.</q>
John 5:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But I have a testimony greater than John's: for the works which the Father hath given me to perform, the very works which I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</q>
John 5:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And the Father who sent me, hath Himself borne witness of me: and <transChange>yet</transChange> ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</q>
John 5:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And ye have not his word abiding in you; because ye believe not Him, whom He hath sent.</q>
John 5:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye search the scriptures; for ye think that in them ye have eternal life:</q>
John 5:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and they testify of me: and <transChange>yet</transChange> ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</q>
John 5:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>Though</transChange> I desire not applause from men:</q>
John 5:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</q>
John 5:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him ye will receive.</q>
John 5:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">How can ye believe, who receive applause from each other, and the glory <transChange>which is</transChange> from God only, ye seek not?</q>
John 5:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: there is <transChange>one</transChange> that accuseth you, <transChange>even</transChange> Moses, in whom ye trust.</q>
John 5:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote concerning me:</q>

John 6:0 <chapter osisID="John.6" sID="gen3191"/>
John 6:1 After these <transChange>things</transChange> Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is <transChange>the sea</transChange> of Tiberias.
John 6:2 And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw his miracles which He performed on them that were diseased.
John 6:3 So Jesus went up to a mountain, and there He sat down with his disciples.
John 6:4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.
John 6:5 Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude come to Him, saith to Philip, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whence shall we buy bread that these <transChange>people</transChange> may eat?</q>
John 6:6 (and this He said to try him, for He knew what He was going to do:)
John 6:7 Philip answered Him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
John 6:8 One of his disciples, <transChange>to wit,</transChange> Andrew the brother of Simon Peter,
John 6:9 saith unto Him, There is a lad here, that hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?
John 6:10 And Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Make the men sit down:</q> (now there was much grass in the place:) so the men sat down <transChange>in</transChange> number about five thousand.
John 6:11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed <transChange>them</transChange> to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sat down; and of the fishes likewise, as much as they would <transChange>take.</transChange>
John 6:12 And when they were filled, He saith to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Gather up the fragments that are left, that nothing may be lost.</q>
John 6:13 They therefore gathered <transChange>them</transChange> together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained after they had eaten.
John 6:14 Therefore the people when they had seen the miracle that Jesus wrought, said, this is certainly the Prophet who was to come into the world.
John 6:15 Jesus therefore knowing that they would come, and take Him by force <transChange>if possible,</transChange> to make Him king, retired again to the mountain Himself alone.
John 6:16 And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea:
John 6:17 and having entered into a ship were going over the Sea towards Capernaum: and it was now dark, and Jesus was not <transChange>yet</transChange> come to them.
John 6:18 And the sea rose <transChange>high by reason of</transChange> a violent wind.
John 6:19 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and near the ship: and they were affrighted.
John 6:20 But He saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is I: be not afraid.</q>
John 6:21 They desired therefore to take Him into the ship: and immediately the vessel was at the land to which they were going.
John 6:22 The day following the people that staid on the other side of the sea, seeing there was no other boat there, but that one into which his disciples embarked, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but <transChange>that</transChange> his disciples went away alone:
John 6:23 though there came other vessels from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten bread after the Lord had given thanks: when therefore the people saw that Jesus was not there,
John 6:24 nor his disciples; they also went into <transChange>those</transChange> vessels, and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
John 6:25 And when they found Him on the other side of the Sea, they said unto Him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
John 6:26 Jesus answered them and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</q>
John 6:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Labour not <transChange>so much</transChange> for the meat that perisheth, but <transChange>rather</transChange> for that food which endureth unto life eternal, which the Son of man will give you: for Him hath God the Father sealed.</q>
John 6:28 Therefore said they unto Him, What should we do, that we may work the works <transChange>approved</transChange> of God?
John 6:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him, whom He hath sent.</q>
John 6:30 Therefore said they unto Him, What sign dost thou shew, that we may see <transChange>it,</transChange> and believe Thee? What work dost thou do?
John 6:31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
John 6:32 Therefore Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily, I tell you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</q>
John 6:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For the bread of God is that which descendeth from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</q>
John 6:34 Therefore said they unto Him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
John 6:35 Then Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</q>
John 6:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But I have told you, <transChange>so</transChange> that ye have seen me, and <transChange>yet</transChange> ye do not believe.</q>
John 6:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">All that the Father giveth me, will come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will not cast out.</q>
John 6:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.</q>
John 6:39 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of all that He hath given me, I should lose none, but should raise them up at the last day.</q>
John 6:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one who looketh <transChange>attentively</transChange> at the Son, and <transChange>so</transChange> believeth on Him, may have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</q>
John 6:41 The Jews then murmured about Him; because He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the bread that came down from heaven.</q>
John 6:42 And they said <transChange>to one another,</transChange> Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we knew? How then does He say, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I came down from heaven?</q>
John 6:43 Jesus therefore said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Murmur not among yourselves.</q>
John 6:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">No one can come to me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</q>
John 6:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is written in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught of God." Every <transChange>one</transChange> therefore that hath heard and learned from the Father, cometh unto me.</q>
John 6:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Not that any <transChange>one</transChange> hath seen the Father, but He who is from God.</q>
John 6:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He hath seen the Father. Verily, verily, I declare unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</q>
John 6:48 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead:</q>
John 6:49 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>but</transChange> this is the bread which cometh down from heaven,</q>
John 6:50 <q marker="" who="Jesus">that any <transChange>one</transChange> may eat thereof and not die.</q>
John 6:51 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the living bread, which came down from heaven: if any <transChange>one</transChange> eat of this bread, he shall live for ever. And the bread, that I will give, is my flesh, which I will give <transChange>up</transChange> for the life of the world.</q>
John 6:52 The Jews therefore cavilled amongst themselves, saying, How can this <transChange>man</transChange> give us his flesh to eat?
John 6:53 Then said Jesus unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I tell you truly, <transChange>that</transChange> unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</q>
John 6:54 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</q>
John 6:55 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink: he that feedeth on my flesh and drinketh my blood,</q>
John 6:56 <q marker="" who="Jesus">abideth in me and I in him.</q>
John 6:57 <q marker="" who="Jesus">As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that feedeth on me he also shall live by me.</q>
John 6:58 <q marker="" who="Jesus">This is the bread that came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat, and <transChange>yet</transChange> are dead. He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.</q>
John 6:59 These things He said in the synagogue, <transChange>when He was</transChange> teaching in Capernaum.
John 6:60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard <transChange>Him,</transChange> said, This discourse is hard to be <transChange>understood,</transChange> who can take it in?
John 6:61 But Jesus knowing in Himself, that his disciples were murmuring about it, said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Does this offend you?</q>
John 6:62 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>What</transChange> then, if ye should see the Son of man ascending up, where He was before?</q>
John 6:63 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The spirit is the principle of life, the flesh availeth nothing: <transChange>now</transChange> the words that I speak unto you are spirit, and <transChange>therefore</transChange> life.</q>
John 6:64 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But there are some of you that believe not:</q> (for Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who would betray Him:
John 6:65 and He said,) <q marker="" who="Jesus">therefore I told you, that no one can come unto me except it be given him from my Father.</q>
John 6:66 From this <transChange>time</transChange> many of his disciples went away, and walked no more with Him.
John 6:67 Jesus therefore said to the twelve, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have ye also a mind to go away?</q>
John 6:68 Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
John 6:69 Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and know that thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
John 6:70 Jesus answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</q>
John 6:71 Now He spake of Judas Iscariot, <transChange>the son</transChange> of Simon; for he was about to betray Him, though he was one of the twelve <transChange>apostles.</transChange> <chapter eID="gen3191" osisID="John.6"/>
John 7:0 <chapter osisID="John.7" sID="gen3263"/>
John 7:1 After these things Jesus resided in Galilee: for He would not appear in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
John 7:2 Now the Jews feast <transChange>called the feast</transChange> of tabernacles was near;
John 7:3 his brethren therefore said, Depart from hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples <transChange>there</transChange> also may see the works which thou performest.
John 7:4 For no man doth any <transChange>thing</transChange> in secret, who is himself desirous to be <transChange>known</transChange> in public. As thou dost these <transChange>wonderful</transChange> things, make thyself known to the world.
John 7:5 For neither did his brethren believe in Him.
John 7:6 Then saith Jesus unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My time is not yet come: but your time is always <transChange>alike</transChange> ready; for the world cannot hate you:</q>
John 7:7 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but me it hates, because I bear <transChange>my</transChange> testimony concerning it, that it's deeds are evil.</q>
John 7:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go ye up to this feast <transChange>as soon as ye please; for</transChange> I am not yet going up to it, because my time is not yet fully come.</q>
John 7:9 And after He had said these <transChange>things</transChange> unto them, He stayed <transChange>a while</transChange> in Galilee.
John 7:10 But when his brethren were gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not in a public manner but as it were in private.
John 7:11 The Jews therefore sought for Him at the feast, and said, Where is He?
John 7:12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him: <transChange>for</transChange> some said, He is a good <transChange>man;</transChange> others said, No: He deceiveth the people.
John 7:13 No one however spake openly <transChange>in favor</transChange> of Him, for fear of the Jews.
John 7:14 But <transChange>when it was</transChange> now <transChange>about</transChange> the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
John 7:15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this <transChange>man</transChange> letters, who never learnt?
John 7:16 Jesus answered them and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The doctrine that I teach is not mine, but his that sent me.</q>
John 7:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any <transChange>man</transChange> desire to do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <transChange>whether</transChange> I speak of myself.</q>
John 7:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He, that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of Him that sent him is true, and there is no imposture in him.</q>
John 7:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Did not Moses give you the law, and <transChange>yet</transChange> none of you observeth the law? wherefore <transChange>else</transChange> do ye seek to kill me?</q>
John 7:20 The people answered and said, Thou art possessed by a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?
John 7:21 Jesus answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I performed one miracle <transChange>on the</transChange> <transChange>sabbath,</transChange> and ye are all amazed at it.</q>
John 7:22 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>Now</transChange> Moses gave you the <transChange>law of</transChange> circumcision, (not that it is <transChange>originally</transChange> from Moses, but from the patriarchs,) and ye circumcise <transChange>even</transChange> on the sabbath:</q>
John 7:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus">if <transChange>then</transChange> a man receive circumcision on the sabbath-<transChange>day,</transChange> that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye angry with me, because I made a man perfectly well on the sabbath-<transChange>day?</transChange></q>
John 7:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgement.</q>
John 7:25 Therefore some of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this He whom they seek to put to death?
John 7:26 and here He talketh openly, and they say nothing to Him: Do the rulers indeed know, that this is in truth the Messiah?
John 7:27 But we know whence this <transChange>man</transChange> is; whereas when Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence He is.
John 7:28 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye both know me, <transChange>ye say,</transChange> and ye know whence I am: now I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</q>
John 7:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He hath sent me.</q>
John 7:30 They sought therefore to seize Him, but no one laid hand on Him, because his hour was not yet come.
John 7:31 And many of the people believed on Him, and said, When the Messiah cometh, will He do more miracles than this <transChange>man</transChange> hath done?
John 7:32 <transChange>Now</transChange> the pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning Him: and they, with the chief priests, sent officers to seize Him.
John 7:33 Therefore Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Yet a little while I am <transChange>to be</transChange> among you, and <transChange>then</transChange> I <transChange>shall</transChange> go to Him that sent me.</q>
John 7:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <transChange>me:</transChange> and where I am <transChange>to be,</transChange> ye cannot come.</q>
John 7:35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will He go, that we shall not find Him? will He go to them that are dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
John 7:36 What is <transChange>the meaning of</transChange> this speech, that He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <transChange>me:</transChange> and where I am <transChange>to be,</transChange> ye cannot come?"</q>
John 7:37 And on the last day, the great <transChange>day</transChange> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any one thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</q>
John 7:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, rivers of living water shall flow from within him.</q>
John 7:39 (This He spake of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive; for the holy Spirit was not yet <transChange>given,</transChange> because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
John 7:40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard <transChange>this</transChange> discourse, said, This is in truth a prophet.
John 7:41 Others said, This is the Messiah. But some said, Shall the Messiah come out of Galilee?
John 7:42 Hath not the Scripture said, that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town whence David was.
John 7:43 So there was a division among the people about Him.
John 7:44 And some among them would have seized Him: but no one laid hands on Him.
John 7:45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees, and they said, Why have ye not brought Him? <transChange>and</transChange> the officers answered,
John 7:46 Never man spake like this man.
John 7:47 The pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also deceived?
John 7:48 have any of the rulers believed on Him, or of the pharisees?
John 7:49 but these people, who know not the law, are cursed.
John 7:50 <transChange>Upon this</transChange> Nicodemus, (who came to Him by night)
John 7:51 being one of them, saith to them, Doth our law judge any man, before <transChange>it</transChange> hear him, and know what he hath done?
John 7:52 They replied, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and see: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
John 7:53 And every <transChange>man</transChange> went to his own house. <chapter eID="gen3263" osisID="John.7"/>
John 8:0 <chapter osisID="John.8" sID="gen3317"/>
John 8:1 But Jesus went to the mount of Olives;
John 8:2 and returned early in the morning into the temple, and all the people came to Him: and He sat down, and taught them.
John 8:3 And the scribes and pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery;
John 8:4 and setting her in the midst, they said to Him, "This woman was caught in the very act, committing adultery.
John 8:5 Now Moses in the law has commanded us that such <transChange>women</transChange> should be stoned, but what sayest Thou?"
John 8:6 This they said to tempt Him, that they might have <transChange>something</transChange> to accuse Him <transChange>of.</transChange> But Jesus stooping down, wrote with <transChange>his</transChange> finger upon the ground.
John 8:7 And as they continued asking Him, He raised himself up and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Let him that is without sin among you, first cast a stone at her."</q>
John 8:8 Then He stooped down again and wrote on the ground.
John 8:9 But when they heard <transChange>his answer,</transChange> being convicted by their own conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the elder, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst <transChange>of the people.</transChange>
John 8:10 Then Jesus rising up, and seeing none but the woman, said unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</q>
John 8:11 And she said, None, Lord. Then said Jesus unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Neither do I condemn thee, Go thy way and sin no more.</q>
John 8:12 Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the light of the world; he, that followeth me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</q>
John 8:13 The pharisees therefore said to Him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy testimony is not true.
John 8:14 Jesus answered and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Though I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I am going; but ye know not whence I come, nor whither I go.</q>
John 8:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye judge according to the flesh, <transChange>but</transChange> I judge no man <transChange>as yet:</transChange></q>
John 8:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">though if I <transChange>should</transChange> judge, my judgement is true; for I am not alone, but I <transChange>am</transChange> with the Father that sent me.</q>
John 8:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And it is written in your own law, that the testimony of two persons is valid.</q>
John 8:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>Now</transChange> I am <transChange>one,</transChange> who bear witness of myself; and the Father, who sent me, beareth witness of me.</q>
John 8:19 Then said they unto Him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</q>
John 8:20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, when He was teaching in the temple: and no one laid hands on Him, for his hour was not yet come.
John 8:21 Jesus therefore said unto them again, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"I am going away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: where I go ye cannot come."</q>
John 8:22 The Jews therefore said, What! will He kill himself; that He says, <q marker="" who="Jesus">where I am going, ye cannot come?</q>
John 8:23 And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye are from beneath, I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</q>
John 8:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Therefore I said unto you, that ye shall die in your sins; for if ye believe not that I am <transChange>the Messiah,</transChange> ye shall die in your sins.</q>
John 8:25 Then said they to Him, Who art thou? And Jesus answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Even <transChange>the same</transChange> that I told you at first.</q>
John 8:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I have many things to say and to judge concerning you: but <transChange>I only say,</transChange> He that sent me is true, and I declare to the world those <transChange>things,</transChange> which I have heard from Him.</q>
John 8:27 <transChange>But</transChange> they did not know that He spake unto them <transChange>of</transChange> the Father.
John 8:28 Jesus therefore said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am <transChange>He,</transChange> and <transChange>that</transChange> I do nothing of myself, but as my Father hath instructed me, I speak these <transChange>things.</transChange></q>
John 8:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And He that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I always do the things <transChange>that are</transChange> pleasing to Him.</q>
John 8:30 As He spake these <transChange>words</transChange> many believed on Him.
John 8:31 Therefore said Jesus to the Jews that believed on Him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If ye continue in my word, ye are indeed my disciples.</q>
John 8:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</q>
John 8:33 They answered Him, We are the seed of Abraham, and never were slaves to any one, how <transChange>then</transChange> dost thou say, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye shall be made free?</q>
John 8:34 Jesus answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I say unto you, whosoever maketh a practice of sin, is the servant of sin.</q>
John 8:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now the servant does not continue always in the family: but the Son abideth always.</q>
John 8:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If therefore the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</q>
John 8:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I know that ye are the seed of Abraham, but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</q>
John 8:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I speak <transChange>that</transChange> which I have seen with my Father, and ye do what ye have seen with your father.</q>
John 8:39 They answered Him, Abraham is our father, Jesus replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham:</q>
John 8:40 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but now ye seek to kill me, who have told you the truth which I have heard from God: Abraham did not thus.</q>
John 8:41 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>But</transChange> ye do the works of your father.</q> Then said they unto Him, We are not born of fornication, we have one Father, <transChange>even</transChange> God.
John 8:42 Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If God were your father, ye would love me: for I came forth, and do come, from God; neither came I of myself, but He sent me.</q>
John 8:43 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>And</transChange> why do ye not understand my language, <transChange>but</transChange> because ye cannot bear my doctrine?</q>
John 8:44 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye are of <transChange>your</transChange> father the devil, and are bent upon doing the lusts of your father: he was a murderer from the beginning, and continued not in the truth: for there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh like himself, for he is a liar, and the father of such.</q>
John 8:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And because I say the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convicteth me of sin?</q>
John 8:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?</q>
John 8:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He, that is of God, receiveth the words of God; <transChange>but</transChange> ye therefore receive <transChange>them</transChange> not, because ye are not of God.</q>
John 8:48 The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him. Do we not rightly say, that thou art a Samaritan, and art possessed by a demon?
John 8:49 Jesus answered <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am not possessed by a demon, but I honour my Father, though ye dishonour me.</q>
John 8:50 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I seek not my own glory; there is <transChange>One</transChange> that seeketh <transChange>it,</transChange> and judgeth.</q>
John 8:51 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any <transChange>one</transChange> keep my word, he shall never see death.</q>
John 8:52 The Jews therefore said unto Him, Now we are sure that thou art possessed by a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets <transChange>too;</transChange> and thou sayest, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any <transChange>one</transChange> keep my word, he shall never taste of death:</q> art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead?
John 8:53 and the prophets are dead: whom dost thou pretend <transChange>to be?</transChange>
John 8:54 Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I honour myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom ye say that He is your God.</q>
John 8:55 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And <transChange>yet</transChange> ye know him not; but I know Him: and if I should say, That I know Him not, I shall be like you, a liar: but I know Him, and obey his word.</q>
John 8:56 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Your father Abraham longed to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</q>
John 8:57 Then said the Jews unto Him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Before Abraham was, I am.</q>
John 8:59 Therefore they took up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus concealed Himself, and went out of the temple, through the midst of them, and so passed on. <chapter eID="gen3317" osisID="John.8"/>
John 9:0 <chapter osisID="John.9" sID="gen3377"/>
John 9:1 And <transChange>as Jesus was</transChange> passing along, He saw a man, <transChange>who had been</transChange> blind from his birth.
John 9:2 And his disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned? this <transChange>man</transChange> or his parents? that he was born blind.
John 9:3 Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Neither did this <transChange>man</transChange> sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.</q>
John 9:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I must perform the works of Him that sent me, while it is day: the night is coming, when no man can work.</q>
John 9:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>But</transChange> as long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</q>
John 9:6 <transChange>And</transChange> when He had said these <transChange>things,</transChange> He spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind <transChange>man</transChange> with the clay,
John 9:7 and said to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go wash at the pool of Siloam</q> (which signifies Sent.) He went therefore and washed, and came <transChange>again</transChange> seeing.
John 9:8 And the neighbors, and they that had seen him before, that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat begging?
John 9:9 Some said, this is <transChange>he:</transChange> and others, <transChange>It</transChange> is like him: <transChange>but</transChange> he said, I am <transChange>the man.</transChange>
John 9:10 Therefore they said to him, How were thine eyes opened?
John 9:11 He answered and said, A man <transChange>who is</transChange> called Jesus, made clay and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go to the pool of Siloam and wash:</q> and I went and washed and received my sight.
John 9:12 Then said they unto him, Where is He? he answered, I know not.
John 9:13 <transChange>So</transChange> they brought him, that had formerly been blind, to the pharisees.
John 9:14 Now it was the sabbath-<transChange>day,</transChange> when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
John 9:15 Therefore the pharisees also asked him again, how he recovered his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
John 9:16 Then said some of the pharisees, This man is not of God, because He doth not keep the sabbath: <transChange>but</transChange> others said, How can a wicked man do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
John 9:17 <transChange>So</transChange> they asked the blind man again, What sayst thou concerning Him? as He hath opened thine eyes.
John 9:18 And he said, He is a prophet. But the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and recovered sight, till they called the parents of him, that had received his sight.
John 9:19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say, was born blind? how then doth he now see?
John 9:20 His parents answered them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
John 9:21 but how <transChange>it is that</transChange> he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age, ask him; he can speak for himself.
John 9:22 These <transChange>things</transChange> said his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed, that if any one confessed Him <transChange>to be</transChange> Christ, he should be turned out of the synagogue.
John 9:23 Therefore his parents said, he is of age, ask him.
John 9:24 Then they called a second time <transChange>for</transChange> the man that had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: <transChange>for</transChange> we know that this man is a <transChange>great</transChange> sinner.
John 9:25 He answered, and said, Whether He be a sinner, I know not: <transChange>but</transChange> one <transChange>thing</transChange> I know, that I who was blind, do now see.
John 9:26 Then said they to him again, What did he do to thee? how did He open thine eyes?
John 9:27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye would not hear? why would ye <transChange>now</transChange> hear it again? have ye also a mind to be his disciples?
John 9:28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses: we know that God spake to Moses:
John 9:29 but <transChange>as for</transChange> this <transChange>man,</transChange> we know not whence He is.
John 9:30 The man answered, and said unto them, Why this is <transChange>something</transChange> strange, that ye know not whence He is, and <transChange>yet</transChange> He hath opened mine eyes.
John 9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any <transChange>man</transChange> be a servant of God, and do his will, him He heareth.
John 9:32 From <transChange>the beginning of</transChange> the world it was never heard, that any <transChange>one</transChange> opened the eyes of <transChange>a person</transChange> that was born blind.
John 9:33 <transChange>And</transChange> if this <transChange>man</transChange> were not from God, He could do nothing.
John 9:34 They answered, and said unto him, Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us?
John 9:35 And they cast him out. <transChange>Now</transChange> Jesus heard that they had turned him out <transChange>of the synagogue;</transChange> and when He met him, He said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</q>
John 9:36 He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe on Him?
John 9:37 Jesus said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou hast seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee.</q>
John 9:38 And he said, Lord, I believe; and worshipped Him.
John 9:39 And Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am come into this world to <transChange>execute</transChange> judgement; that they who see not, may see; and <transChange>that</transChange> they who <transChange>say they</transChange> see, may be made blind.</q>
John 9:40 And <transChange>some</transChange> of the pharisees who were present, heard these <transChange>words,</transChange> and said to Him, Are we blind also?
John 9:41 Jesus replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If ye were blind, ye would not have sin: but now ye say, We see; your sin therefore remaineth.</q> <chapter eID="gen3377" osisID="John.9"/>
John 10:0 <chapter osisID="John.10" sID="gen3419"/>
John 10:1 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I say unto you, He that entreth not into the sheep-fold by the door, but climbeth up some other way, is a thief and a robber.</q>
John 10:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But he that cometh in by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.</q>
John 10:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice; and He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</q>
John 10:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And when he bringeth forth his sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him; because they know his voice.</q>
John 10:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.</q>
John 10:6 This parable Jesus spake unto them; but they did not understand what He said to them.
John 10:7 Jesus therefore said unto them again, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I tell you, that I am the door of the sheep.</q>
John 10:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not regard them.</q>
John 10:9 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the door: by me if any <transChange>man</transChange> enter in, he shall be saved; and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</q>
John 10:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">The thief cometh only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and may have <transChange>it</transChange> in perfection.</q>
John 10:11 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.</q>
John 10:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But the hireling, that is not the <transChange>true</transChange> shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf seizeth them, and disperseth the sheep.</q>
John 10:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</q>
John 10:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the good shepherd, and I know my <transChange>own sheep,</transChange> and am known by them.</q>
John 10:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</q>
John 10:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they will hear my voice; so there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</q>
John 10:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For this doth the Father love me; because I lay down my life: that I may take it again.</q>
John 10:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">None taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.</q>
John 10:19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews on account of these words.
John 10:20 And many of them said, He is a demoniac, and is mad; why do ye hear Him?
John 10:21 Others said, These are not the words of a demoniac; can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
John 10:22 Now it was the feast of dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter.
John 10:23 And Jesus was walking about the temple, in Solomon's portico.
John 10:24 Then the Jews came round Him, and said unto Him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou be the Messiah, tell us plainly.
John 10:25 Jesus answered them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I have told you, and ye do not believe <transChange>me: though</transChange> the works that I do in the name of my Father, testify of me.</q>
John 10:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But ye believe not; because ye are not of my sheep: <transChange>for</transChange> as I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice,</q>
John 10:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and I know them, and they follow me.</q>
John 10:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; nor shall any one force them out of my hand.</q>
John 10:29 <q marker="" who="Jesus">My Father who gave <transChange>them</transChange> to me, is greater than all: and <transChange>therefore</transChange> none is able to force <transChange>them</transChange> out of my Father's hand.</q>
John 10:30 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I and the Father are one. Then the Jews again took up stones to stone Him.</q>
John 10:31 <transChange>But</transChange> Jesus said unto them,
John 10:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Many good works have I shewn you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</q>
John 10:33 The Jews answered Him, saying, We do not <transChange>go about to</transChange> stone thee for a good work, but for blasphemy; and because thou being a man makest thyself God.
John 10:34 Jesus replied, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Is it not written in your law, "I have said, ye are gods?"</q>
John 10:35 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>And</transChange> if <transChange>it</transChange> stiled them gods, to whom the word of God came, (and the scripture cannot be made void,)</q>
John 10:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">do ye say <transChange>of Him,</transChange> whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?</q>
John 10:37 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</q>
John 10:38 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe, that the Father <transChange>is</transChange> in me, and I in Him.</q>
John 10:39 Therefore they sought again to seize Him; but He escaped out of their hand, and went away again beyond Jordan,
John 10:40 to the place where John was at first baptizing, and there He abode.
John 10:41 And many resorted to Him, and said, John wrought no miracle, but all that he said concerning this <transChange>man,</transChange> was true.
John 10:42 And many there believed on Him. <chapter eID="gen3419" osisID="John.10"/>
John 11:0 <chapter osisID="John.11" sID="gen3462"/>
John 11:1 Now there was a certain <transChange>person</transChange> sick, <transChange>to wit,</transChange> Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and Martha her sister.
John 11:2 (And it was Mary, that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
John 11:3 <transChange>His</transChange> sisters therefore sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
John 11:4 But when Jesus heard <transChange>it,</transChange> He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.</q>
John 11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John 11:6 Therefore when He heard that <transChange>Lazarus</transChange> was sick, He stayed indeed two days in the place where He was:
John 11:7 <transChange>and</transChange> after that He saith to his disciples, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let us go again into Judea.</q>
John 11:8 The disciples say unto Him, Master, the Jews very lately attempted to stone thee, and art thou going thither again?
John 11:9 Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any <transChange>man</transChange> walk in the day, he doth not stumble; for he seeth the light of this world:</q>
John 11:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">but if any <transChange>one</transChange> walk in the night, he stumbleth; because he hath no light.</q>
John 11:11 Having thus answered them, He afterwards saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Our friend Lazarus is asleep; but I am going to awake him.</q>
John 11:12 Therefore his disciples said, Lord, if he sleep, he will do well.
John 11:13 But Jesus spake of his death; though they thought that He was speaking of the refreshment of sleep.
John 11:14 Then Jesus said to them plainly, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Lazarus is dead:</q>
John 11:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and I am glad for your sakes, I was not there, that ye may believe: but let us go to him.</q>
John 11:16 Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
John 11:17 And when Jesus came, He found that he had been four days in the grave.
John 11:18 Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, <transChange>being but</transChange> about fifteen furlongs from <transChange>it:</transChange>
John 11:19 and many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
John 11:20 Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him: but Mary was sitting in the house.
John 11:21 And Martha said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John 11:22 But I know that even now whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will grant it thee.
John 11:23 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thy brother shall rise again.</q>
John 11:24 Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
John 11:25 Jesus <transChange>then</transChange> told her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth on me, though he were dead, shall live <transChange>again.</transChange></q>
John 11:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And every one that is alive, and believeth in me, shall never die.</q>
John 11:27 Dost thou believe this? She saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.
John 11:28 And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister, telling <transChange>her</transChange> privately, The Master is coming and calleth for thee.
John 11:29 As soon as she heard <transChange>it,</transChange> she gets up with <transChange>all</transChange> speed and comes to Him.
John 11:30 For Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him.
John 11:31 The Jews therefore that were with her in the house to comfort her, seeing Mary that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the grave to weep there.
John 11:32 Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw Him, fell down at his feet, saying unto Him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John 11:33 Jesus therefore, when He saw her weeping, and the Jews <transChange>also</transChange> weeping, that came with her, groaned in spirit and was troubled.
John 11:34 And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Where have ye laid him?</q>
John 11:35 They say unto Him, Lord, come and see: <transChange>and</transChange> Jesus wept.
John 11:36 The Jews therefore said, Behold, how he loved him!
John 11:37 but some of them said, Could not He, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused also that this <transChange>man</transChange> should not have died?
John 11:38 Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre: which was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
John 11:39 Jesus saith, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Take away the stone.</q> Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith unto Him, Lord, by this time he is offensive; for it is the fourth day.
John 11:40 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Did I not tell thee, that if thou believest, thou shalt see the glory of God?</q>
John 11:41 So they took away the stone <transChange>from the place</transChange> where the corpse was laid. And Jesus lifted up <transChange>his</transChange> eyes and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Father, I thank Thee, that Thou hast heard me.</q>
John 11:42 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I knew indeed that Thou always hearest me: but because of the people standing by I say <transChange>this,</transChange> that they may believe that Thou hast sent me.</q>
John 11:43 And when He had said these <transChange>things,</transChange> He cried with a loud voice, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Lazarus, come forth.</q>
John 11:44 And he that had been dead came forth, having <transChange>his</transChange> feet and hands rolled up in grave-cloths: and his face bound about with a napkin. <transChange>Then</transChange> Jesus bid them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Loosen him and let him go.</q>
John 11:45 Therefore many of the Jews, that came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed on Him.
John 11:46 But some of them went to the pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
John 11:47 Therefore the chief priests and the pharisees held a council and said, What are we doing? for this man worketh many miracles.
John 11:48 If we suffer Him <transChange>to go on</transChange> thus, all <transChange>the people</transChange> will believe on Him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and nation.
John 11:49 But Caiaphas <transChange>who was</transChange> one of them, being high-priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all;
John 11:50 nor do ye consider, that it is better for us that one man should die for the people, than that the whole nation should perish.
John 11:51 This however he spake not of himself, but being high-priest at that time he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation:
John 11:52 and not for the <transChange>Jewish</transChange> nation only, but that he might also gather together the children of God that are dispersed.
John 11:53 From that day therefore they consulted together to put Him to death.
John 11:54 Wherefore Jesus appeared no longer publicly among the Jews; but went away from thence into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
John 11:55 Now the passover of the Jews was near; and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country, before the passover, to purify themselves.
John 11:56 So they sought for Jesus, and said to one another in the temple, What think ye? that He will not come to the feast?
John 11:57 Now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given order, that if any <transChange>one</transChange> knew where He was, he should inform <transChange>them,</transChange> that they might take Him. <chapter eID="gen3462" osisID="John.11"/>
John 12:0 <chapter osisID="John.12" sID="gen3520"/>
John 12:1 Jesus however, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, <transChange>and</transChange> whom He raised from the dead.
John 12:2 Therefore they made Him a supper there, and Martha waited <transChange>at table,</transChange> but Lazarus was one of them that sat down with Him.
John 12:3 And Mary taking a pound of ointment of spikenard of great value, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
John 12:4 Therefore said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, <transChange>the son</transChange> of Simon, who was about to betray Him,
John 12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?
John 12:6 He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the <transChange>common</transChange> purse he carried what was put in<transChange>to it.</transChange>
John 12:7 Jesus therefore said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Let her alone, she hath reserved this <transChange>as</transChange> for the day of my burial.</q>
John 12:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For the poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always.</q>
John 12:9 And a great number of the Jews understanding that He was there, came not only on account of Jesus, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom He <transChange>had</transChange> raised from the dead.
John 12:10 Wherefore the chief priests took counsel to put Lazarus also to death.
John 12:11 Because on his account many of the Jews went away <transChange>from them,</transChange> and believed on Jesus.
John 12:12 The next day a great multitude that were come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm-trees,
John 12:13 and went out to meet Him, and cried, Hosanna! blessed <transChange>be</transChange> the king of Israel, who cometh in the name of the Lord.
John 12:14 And Jesus having gotten a young ass sat thereon,
John 12:15 as it is written, "Fear not, O daughter of Sion, behold thy king cometh sitting on an ass's colt."
John 12:16 Now his disciples did not understand these <transChange>things</transChange> at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these <transChange>things</transChange> were written concerning Him, and <transChange>that</transChange> they had done thus unto Him.
John 12:17 And the people that were with Him testified, that He called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead:
John 12:18 and for this reason the people went to meet Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.
John 12:19 The pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do ye <transChange>not</transChange> see that ye prevail nothing? Behold, <transChange>all</transChange> the world is gone after Him.
John 12:20 And among those that came up to worship at the feast there were certain Greeks:
John 12:21 that came to Philip <transChange>who was</transChange> of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we have a desire to see Jesus.
John 12:22 <transChange>And</transChange> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
John 12:23 And Jesus answered them saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">The time is come that the Son of man is to be glorified.</q>
John 12:24 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>Though</transChange> I tell you indeed and in truth, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it produceth much fruit.</q>
John 12:25 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>So</transChange> he, that loveth his life, shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it unto life eternal.</q>
John 12:26 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If any <transChange>man</transChange> would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: and if any <transChange>one</transChange> serve me, him will my Father honour.</q>
John 12:27 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this <transChange>cause</transChange> came I to this hour.</q>
John 12:28 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Father, glorify thy name.</q> Then came a voice from heaven, <transChange>saying,</transChange> I have both glorified <transChange>it,</transChange> and will glorify <transChange>it</transChange> again.
John 12:29 The people therefore that stood <transChange>by,</transChange> and heard <transChange>it,</transChange> said, That it was thunder: <transChange>but</transChange> others said, <transChange>it was</transChange> an angel spake to Him.
John 12:30 Jesus answered and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.</q>
John 12:31 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now is the judgement of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</q>
John 12:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, shall draw all <transChange>men</transChange> unto me.</q>
John 12:33 This He said, signifying what death He should die.
John 12:34 The people answered Him, We have heard out of the law, that the Messiah abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, <q marker="" who="Jesus">the Son of man must be lifted up?</q> who is this Son of man?
John 12:35 Then Jesus said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Yet a little while the light is <transChange>to be</transChange> with you; walk while ye have the light, least darkness overtake you; for he that walketh in the dark knoweth not whither he goeth.</q>
John 12:36 <q marker="" who="Jesus">While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</q> These <transChange>things</transChange> spake Jesus, and <transChange>then</transChange> went away, and concealed himself from them.
John 12:37 But though He had done so many miracles before their eyes, <transChange>yet</transChange> they did not believe on Him:
John 12:38 <transChange>so</transChange> that the word of Esaias the prophet was fulfilled, which he spake, <transChange>saying,</transChange> Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
John 12:39 <transChange>And</transChange> therefore they could not believe; for Esaias <transChange>had</transChange> also said,
John 12:40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they might not see with <transChange>their</transChange> eyes, and understand with <transChange>their</transChange> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
John 12:41 These <transChange>things</transChange> said Esaias when he saw his glory, and spake concerning Him.
John 12:42 <transChange>There were</transChange> however many of the chief rulers <transChange>that</transChange> believed on Him; but because of the pharisees they did not confess <transChange>it,</transChange> lest they should be excommunicated.
John 12:43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
John 12:44 And Jesus raised his voice, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me <transChange>only,</transChange> but on Him that sent me:</q>
John 12:45 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth Him that sent me.</q>
John 12:46 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, might not abide in darkness.</q>
John 12:47 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And if any <transChange>one</transChange> hear my words and believe not, I do not condemn him: for I am not <transChange>now</transChange> come to condemn the world, but to save the world.</q>
John 12:48 <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath <transChange>one</transChange> that judgeth him: the word, that I have spoken, will condemn him at the last day.</q>
John 12:49 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father, who sent me, gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.</q>
John 12:50 <q marker="" who="Jesus">And I know that his commandment is life eternal: <transChange>the things</transChange> therefore which I speak, I so speak, as the Father hath directed me.</q> <chapter eID="gen3520" osisID="John.12"/>

John 13:1 Now before the feast of the passover, (Jesus knowing that his hour was come, when He should pass out of this world unto the Father, as He had loved his own, who were <transChange>yet</transChange> in the world, He loved them unto the end:)
John 13:2 supper being prepared, (the devil having put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, <transChange>the son</transChange> of Simon, to betray Him) Jesus,
John 13:3 who knew that the Father had given all <transChange>things</transChange> into his hands, and that He came from God, and was going to God,
John 13:4 riseth from supper, and turneth aside his clothes, and took a towel and tied <transChange>it</transChange> about Him;
John 13:5 <transChange>and</transChange> then pouring water into a bason, began to wash the feet of <transChange>his</transChange> disciples, and to wipe <transChange>them</transChange> with the towel wherewith He was girded.
John 13:6 He cometh therefore to Simon Peter <transChange>among the rest,</transChange> who saith unto Him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
John 13:7 Jesus answered and said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What I do thou dost not now understand, but thou shalt know hereafter.</q>
John 13:8 Peter saith to Him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I do not wash thee, thou hast no part with me.</q>
John 13:9 Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also <transChange>my</transChange> hands and <transChange>my</transChange> head.
John 13:10 Jesus saith to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">He that hath been bathing, hath need only to wash his feet, being <transChange>then</transChange> clean all over: and <transChange>thus</transChange> ye are clean, but not all <transChange>of you.</transChange></q>
John 13:11 For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye are not all clean.</q>
John 13:12 And when He had washed their feet, and taken his clothes <transChange>about Him,</transChange> He sat down again, and said to them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Do ye know <transChange>the intent of</transChange> what I have been doing to you?</q>
John 13:13 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ye call me, Master, and Lord; and ye say well; for <transChange>so</transChange> I am.</q>
John 13:14 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I then <transChange>your</transChange> Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</q>
John 13:15 <q marker="" who="Jesus">For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.</q>
John 13:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord, nor <transChange>is</transChange> the messenger greater than he that sent him.</q>
John 13:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">If ye know these <transChange>things,</transChange> happy are ye, if ye do them.</q>
John 13:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen: but <transChange>have done it</transChange> that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.</q>
John 13:19 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>And</transChange> I tell you now, before it come, that when it comes to pass ye may believe that I am <transChange>the Messiah.</transChange></q>
John 13:20 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I say unto you, He that receiveth <transChange>him,</transChange> whom I shall send, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.</q>
John 13:21 Jesus having said these <transChange>things</transChange> was troubled in spirit, and He <transChange>openly</transChange> testified and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I tell you, that one of you will betray me.</q>
John 13:22 The disciples therefore looked on one another, doubting of whom He spake.
John 13:23 Now there was one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, sitting next Him.
John 13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him to ask, who it was concerning whom He spake.
John 13:25 And he, reclining on the breast of Jesus, saith unto Him, Lord, who is it?
John 13:26 Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is he to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped <transChange>it:</transChange></q> and He dipped in a sop and gave <transChange>it</transChange> to Judas <transChange>the</transChange> Iscariot <transChange>the son</transChange> of Simon.
John 13:27 And after the sop Satan entred into him. Then Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What thou dost, do quickly.</q>
John 13:28 But none of those that sat at table knew wherefore He said this to him.
John 13:29 For some <transChange>of them</transChange> thought, because Judas kept the purse, that Jesus said to him, Buy what <transChange>things</transChange> we have need of against the feast: or that he should give something to the poor.
John 13:30 He therefore, when he had taken the sop, immediately went out. And it was night.
John 13:31 And when he was gone out Jesus said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him:</q>
John 13:32 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>and</transChange> if God be glorified in Him, God will glorify Him in Himself, and will soon glorify Him.</q>
John 13:33 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Little children, I am <transChange>to be</transChange> with you <transChange>but</transChange> a little <transChange>while</transChange> longer. Ye will wish for me, and as I said to the Jews, "Whither I go ye cannot come", so I now tell you.</q>
John 13:34 <q marker="" who="Jesus">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; ---as I have loved you, that ye also love one another: <transChange>for</transChange> by this shall all <transChange>men</transChange> know that ye are my disciples,</q>

John 13:36 Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, whither art thou going? Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whither I am going thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me hereafter.</q>
John 13:37 Peter saith unto Him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
John 13:38 Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily verily I tell thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.</q> <chapter eID="gen3571" osisID="John.13"/>

John 17:1 When Jesus had spoken these <transChange>words,</transChange> He lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,---<q marker="" who="Jesus">"Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify Thee:</q>
John 17:2 <q marker="" who="Jesus">as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, that <transChange>as to</transChange> all which Thou hast given Him, He might give them eternal life;</q>
John 17:3 <q marker="" who="Jesus">and this is life eternal, to know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</q>
John 17:4 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I have glorified Thee on earth, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do:</q>

John 17:6 <q marker="" who="Jesus">I have manifested thy name to the men, whom Thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and Thou gavest them to me, and they have kept thy word.</q>

John 17:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name; I have preserved <transChange>those</transChange> whom Thou gavest me, and none of them is lost; except the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.</q>

John 18:0 <chapter osisID="John.18" sID="gen3731"/>
John 18:1 When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with his disciples over the brook Kedron; where there was a garden, into which He entred, and his disciples. Now Judas who was <transChange>gone</transChange> to betray Him,
John 18:2 knew the place: for Jesus often met there together with his disciples: Judas therefore having got a band <transChange>of soldiers,</transChange>
John 18:3 and officers from the chief priests and pharisees, cometh thither with candles, and lamps, and arms.
John 18:4 Upon which Jesus, who knew all that was coming upon Him, went forth and said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whom do ye seek?</q> They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene.
John 18:5 Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am <transChange>He.</transChange></q> And Judas that betrayed Him, was standing with them.
John 18:6 Now as soon as He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am <transChange>He,</transChange></q> they went backwards and fell to the ground.
John 18:7 Then He asked them again, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Whom do ye seek?</q>
John 18:8 And they said, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I have told you that I am <transChange>He:</transChange> if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</q>
John 18:9 That the word might be fulfilled which He had spoken, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Of those, whom Thou hast given me, I have lost none."</q>
John 18:10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
John 18:11 But Jesus said to Peter, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</q>
John 18:12 So the band with the captain, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus, and bound Him:
John 18:13 and led Him away to Annas first: (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high-priest that year:)
John 18:14 and Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high-priest. Now Caiaphas was he who had said in council to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
John 18:15 And Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. And that <transChange>other</transChange> disciple being known to the high priest went in with Jesus into the high-priest's hall.
John 18:16 But Peter stood at the door without: the other disciple therefore, who was known to the high-priest, went out and spake to her that kept the door, and brought Peter in.
John 18:17 Then saith the maid, that kept the door, to Peter, Art not thou also <transChange>one</transChange> of this man's disciples? <transChange>and</transChange> he said, I am not.
John 18:18 And the servants and officers stood <transChange>there,</transChange> having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and were warming themselves: and Peter was standing with them and warming himself.
John 18:19 The high-priest therefore asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and his doctrine.
John 18:20 Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I spake openly to the world, I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither the Jews are continually resorting: and in secret have said nothing. Why dost thou ask me?</q>
John 18:21 <q marker="" who="Jesus">ask them that heard <transChange>me,</transChange> what I have said unto them: for they know what I have said.</q>
John 18:22 And upon his saying these <transChange>things,</transChange> one of the officers that stood by struck Jesus, saying, Dost thou answer the high-priest thus?
John 18:23 Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I have <transChange>ever</transChange> spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why dost thou strike me?</q>
John 18:24 <transChange>[See verse 24 between verse 13 and 14.]</transChange>
John 18:25 And Simon Peter stood warming himself: and they said to him, Art not thou <transChange>one</transChange> of his disciples? <transChange>and</transChange> he denied <transChange>it,</transChange> and said, I am not.
John 18:26 <transChange>Then</transChange> said one of the servants of the high-priest, kinsman <transChange>to him</transChange> whose ear Peter cut off, Did not I see thee in the garden with Him?
John 18:27 Peter then denied <transChange>it</transChange> again, and immediately the cock crew.
John 18:28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the pretorium: (now it was morning) and they themselves went not in to the court, least they should be defiled, and <transChange>so might</transChange> not eat <transChange>of</transChange> the passover.
John 18:29 Therefore Pilate went out to them, and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man?
John 18:30 They answered him, If He were not a malefactor, we should not have delivered Him to thee.
John 18:31 Then said Pilate to them, Take Him, and judge Him according to your law. But the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
John 18:32 that what Jesus had said might be fulfilled, signifying by what death He should die.
John 18:33 Pilate therefore went into the palace again, and called Jesus and said to Him, Art thou the king of the Jews?
John 18:34 Jesus answered him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Dost thou say this from thyself, or did others tell <transChange>it</transChange> thee of me?</q>
John 18:35 Pilate replied, Am I a Jew? thine own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?
John 18:36 Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought, that I might not have been delivered to the Jews: but my kingdom is not from hence.</q>
John 18:37 Pilate therefore said unto Him, Art thou then a king? Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou sayest <transChange>right,</transChange> I am a king. For this <transChange>end</transChange> was I born, and for this came I into the world, <transChange>even</transChange> that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.</q>
John 18:38 Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? And as soon as he had spoke, he went out again to the Jews,
John 18:39 and saith unto them, I find no fault at all in Him. But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover; will ye therefore <transChange>that</transChange> I release to you the king of the Jews?
John 18:40 Then they all cried out again, saying, Not Him, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. <chapter eID="gen3731" osisID="John.18"/>
John 19:0 <chapter osisID="John.19" sID="gen3772"/>
John 19:1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged <transChange>Him.</transChange>
John 19:2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put <transChange>it</transChange> on his head,
John 19:3 and threw a purple robe about Him, and said, "Hail king of the Jews," and struck Him with their hands.
John 19:4 Pilate therefore came out again, and saith unto them, Behold I bring Him out to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in Him.
John 19:5 So Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, "Behold the man."
John 19:6 When the chief priests therefore and the officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify <transChange>Him,</transChange> crucify <transChange>Him.</transChange>" Pilate saith unto them, Take Him yourselves, and crucify <transChange>Him:</transChange> for I find no fault in Him.
John 19:7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law He ought to die, because He made himself the Son of God.
John 19:8 Now when Pilate heard this he was the more afraid;
John 19:9 and went into the palace again, and saith to Jesus, From whence art thou? but Jesus gave him no answer.
John 19:10 Pilate therefore saith unto Him, Dost thou not speak to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
John 19:11 Jesus answered, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above; wherefore he, that delivered me up to thee, hath the greater sin.</q>
John 19:12 Upon this Pilate sought to release Him; but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this <transChange>man,</transChange> thou art not Cesar's friend; <transChange>for</transChange> whosoever maketh himself a king, opposeth Cesar.
John 19:13 Therefore when Pilate heard this he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John 19:14 (And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour.) And he saith to the Jews, Behold your king. But they cried out,
John 19:15 Away with <transChange>Him,</transChange> away with <transChange>Him,</transChange> crucify Him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.
John 19:16 Then delivered he Him therefore unto them to be crucified.
John 19:17 And they took Jesus, and led Him away. And He went out, bearing his cross, into a place called <transChange>the place</transChange> of a scull, in Hebrew Golgotha:
John 19:18 where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, <transChange>one</transChange> on each side, and Jesus in the middle.
John 19:19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross: and there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John 19:20 Many of the Jews therefore read this inscription; for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, <transChange>and</transChange> Latin.
John 19:21 And the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not "The king of the Jews," but that "He said, I am king of the Jews."
John 19:22 Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
John 19:23 And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, (and made four parts, to each soldier a part,) and <transChange>his</transChange> coat. Now the coat had no seam <transChange>in it,</transChange> being woven from the top throughout:
John 19:24 they said therefore to one another, Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, "They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots." These <transChange>things</transChange> therefore the soldiers did.
John 19:25 Now there stood near the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary <transChange>the wife</transChange> of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John 19:26 Jesus therefore seeing <transChange>his</transChange> mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, saith to his mother, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Woman, behold thy son:</q>
John 19:27 <transChange>and</transChange> then saith to the disciple, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Behold thy mother.</q> And from that hour the <transChange>same</transChange> disciple took her to his own home.
John 19:28 After this Jesus knowing that all <transChange>things</transChange> were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I thirst.</q>
John 19:29 Now there was set a vessel <transChange>there</transChange> full of vinegar: so they filled a spunge with <transChange>the</transChange> vinegar, and putting it upon hyssop, held it up to his mouth.
John 19:30 And when Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is finished.</q> And reclining his head, He yielded up the ghost.
John 19:31 The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath-<transChange>day,</transChange> because it was <transChange>now</transChange> the preparation, (for that sabbath-day was an high-<transChange>day</transChange>) desired Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <transChange>that</transChange> they might be taken away.
John 19:32 So the soldiers came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with Him. But coming to Jesus,
John 19:33 as they saw He was dead already, they did not break his legs:
John 19:34 but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.
John 19:35 And he that saw <transChange>it</transChange> testifieth <transChange>it,</transChange> and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe.
John 19:36 For these <transChange>things</transChange> were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of Him shall be broken.
John 19:37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.
John 19:38 And after these <transChange>things</transChange> Joseph of Arimathea (who was a disciple of Jesus, but <transChange>a</transChange> concealed <transChange>one</transChange> for fear of the Jews) petitioned Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave <transChange>him</transChange> leave: he came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.
John 19:39 And there came also Nicodemus (who at first came to Jesus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound <transChange>weight.</transChange>
John 19:40 So they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
John 19:41 Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified; and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which none had ever yet been laid.
John 19:42 There therefore they laid Jesus, because of the Jews preparation-<transChange>day;</transChange> for the sepulchre was near. <chapter eID="gen3772" osisID="John.19"/>
John 20:0 <chapter osisID="John.20" sID="gen3815"/>
John 20:1 Now on the first <transChange>day</transChange> of the week Mary Magdalene cometh early in the morning, while it was yet dark, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
John 20:2 She therefore runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid Him.
John 20:3 Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
John 20:4 So they both ran together, but the other disciple out-ran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre:
John 20:5 and stooping down <transChange>to look in</transChange> saw the linen cloths lying; but did not go in.
John 20:6 Then cometh Simon Peter, who followed him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen cloths lying <transChange>there;</transChange>
John 20:7 and the napkin that was upon his head, not laid with the linen cloths, but folded up by itself.
John 20:8 Then went in also the other disciple; who came first to the sepulchre, and he saw and believed.
John 20:9 For they did not before understand the scripture, that He must rise from the dead.
John 20:10 So the <transChange>two</transChange> disciples went away again to their own company.
John 20:11 But Mary stood without near the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept she stooped down to <transChange>look into</transChange> the sepulchre; and <transChange>there</transChange> seeth two angels in white sitting,
John 20:12 one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
John 20:13 And they said to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.
John 20:14 And having said this, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
John 20:15 <transChange>Then</transChange> said Jesus to her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Woman, why dost thou weep? whom dost thou seek?</q> She thinking that it was the gardener, saith to Him, Sir, if thou hast carried Him <transChange>hence,</transChange> tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away.
John 20:16 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Mary:</q> <transChange>and</transChange> she turned herself and said unto Him, Rabboni, that is to say, Master.
John 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Touch me not <transChange>now;</transChange> for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go <transChange>directly</transChange> to my brethren, and tell them, "I <transChange>am to</transChange> ascend to my Father and your Father, and <transChange>to</transChange> my God and your God."</q>
John 20:18 <transChange>So</transChange> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and <transChange>that</transChange> He <transChange>had</transChange> said these <transChange>things</transChange> to her.
John 20:19 Now the same day at evening, <transChange>being</transChange> the first <transChange>day</transChange> of the week, and the doors where the disciples were being shut, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Peace <transChange>be</transChange> to you.</q>
John 20:20 And when He had said this, He shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
John 20:21 Then said Jesus unto them again, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Peace <transChange>be</transChange> to you. As <transChange>my</transChange> Father sent me, even so send I you.</q>
John 20:22 And when He said this, He breathed upon <transChange>them,</transChange> and saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Receive <transChange>ye</transChange> the holy Spirit:</q>
John 20:23 <q marker="" who="Jesus"><transChange>and</transChange> whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; <transChange>but</transChange> whose soever <transChange>sins</transChange> ye retain, they are retained.</q>
John 20:24 But Thomas called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.
John 20:25 The other disciples therefore told him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and my hand into his side, I will not believe.
John 20:26 And after eight days his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them: <transChange>and</transChange> Jesus came (the doors being shut <transChange>as before</transChange>) and stood in the midst, and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Peace <transChange>be</transChange> to you.</q>
John 20:27 Then saith He to Thomas, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach <transChange>hither</transChange> thy hand, and put <transChange>it</transChange> into my side; and be not incredulous, but believing.</q>
John 20:28 And Thomas answered, and said, "My Lord and my God."
John 20:29 Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed <transChange>are</transChange> they that have not seen, and <transChange>yet</transChange> have believed.</q>
John 20:30 And indeed Jesus wrought many other signs also in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
John 20:31 but these <transChange>things</transChange> are written, that ye may believe, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life through his name. <chapter eID="gen3815" osisID="John.20"/>
John 21:0 <chapter osisID="John.21" sID="gen3847"/>
John 21:1 After these <transChange>things</transChange> Jesus shewed Himself again to the disciples near the sea of Tiberias; and He shewed <transChange>Himself</transChange> thus.
John 21:2 Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <transChange>sons</transChange> of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together:
John 21:3 <transChange>and</transChange> Simon Peter saith unto them, I <transChange>will</transChange> go a fishing, <transChange>and</transChange> they say to him, We <transChange>will</transChange> also go with thee. <transChange>So</transChange> they went out, and forthwith entered into a ship: and that night they caught nothing.
John 21:4 But when it was morning, Jesus stood on the shore: though the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
John 21:5 Then Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Young men, have ye any thing to eat?</q>
John 21:6 They answered Him, No. And He said unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye will find <transChange>some.</transChange></q> So they cast <transChange>it,</transChange> and they were not able to draw it <transChange>up</transChange> by reason of the multitude of fishes.
John 21:7 Whereupon that disciple whom Jesus loved, saith to Peter, "It is the Lord." Then Simon Peter perceiving that it was the Lord, girded on his coat, (for he was stript,) and threw himself into the sea;
John 21:8 and the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net of fishes; for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits.
John 21:9 And as soon as they were come to land, they saw a fire laid, and fish upon <transChange>it,</transChange> and bread.
John 21:10 <transChange>And</transChange> Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Bring <transChange>some</transChange> of the fish, which ye have now caught.</q>
John 21:11 <transChange>Then</transChange> Simon Peter went aboard, and drew the net to land, full of large fishes, an hundred fifty-three: and though there were so many, the net was not broken.
John 21:12 Jesus saith unto them, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Come, <transChange>and</transChange> dine.</q> And none of the disciples presumed to ask Him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
John 21:13 Jesus therefore cometh and taketh bread, and giveth <transChange>it</transChange> to them, and fish likewise.
John 21:14 This was the third time that Jesus shewed Himself to <transChange>a number of</transChange> his disciples, after He was risen from the dead.
John 21:15 Now when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Simon <transChange>son</transChange> of Jonas, dost thou love me more than these?</q> He saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Feed my lambs.</q>
John 21:16 He saith to him again the second time, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Simon <transChange>son</transChange> of Jonas, dost thou love me?</q> He saith unto Him, Yes, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee.
John 21:17 He saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Feed my sheep.</q> He saith unto him the third time, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Simon <transChange>son</transChange> of Jonas, dost thou love me?</q> Peter was grieved, that He said to him the third time, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Dost thou love me?</q> And he said unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Feed my sheep.</q>
John 21:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">Verily, verily I say unto thee, When thou wast younger, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst about where thou wouldest: but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch out thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee where thou wouldest not.</q>
John 21:19 This He said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had said this, He saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Follow me.</q>
John 21:20 And Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, (and who leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that will betray Thee?) following <transChange>them;</transChange>
John 21:21 <transChange>and upon</transChange> seeing him, Peter saith to Jesus, Lord, what <transChange>shall</transChange> this <transChange>man do?</transChange>
John 21:22 Jesus saith unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">If I will that he stay till I come, what <transChange>is it</transChange> to thee? Follow thou me.</q>
John 21:23 This rumor therefore was spread among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: though Jesus did not say that he should not die, but---<q marker="" who="Jesus">if I will that he stay till I come, what <transChange>is that</transChange> to thee?</q>
John 21:24 This is the disciple that testifieth of these <transChange>things,</transChange> and that writeth them: and we know that his testimony is true.
John 21:25 There are also many other <transChange>things</transChange> that Jesus did, which if they were <transChange>to be</transChange> described particularly, I suppose that the whole world could not contain the books <transChange>that would be</transChange> written <transChange>concerning them.</transChange> Amen. <chapter eID="gen3847" osisID="John.21"/> <div eID="gen2972" osisID="John" type="book"/>

Acts 1:1 <hi type="bold">The</hi> former treatise, O Theophilus, I made concerning all that Jesus undertook both to do and to teach;

Acts 1:4 And meeting <transChange>them</transChange> together He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, <q marker="" who="Jesus">which,</q> <transChange>said He,</transChange> <q marker="" who="Jesus">ye have heard from me;</q>
Acts 1:5 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall within a few days be baptized with the holy Spirit.</q>

Acts 1:8 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But ye shall receive power <transChange>from</transChange> the holy Spirit coming upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the uttermost <transChange>part</transChange> of the earth.</q>
Acts 1:9 And having said these <transChange>things,</transChange> as they were looking <transChange>upon Him,</transChange> He was lifted up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
Acts 1:10 And while they were looking stedfastly toward heaven, as He went <transChange>up,</transChange> behold two men in white stood by them;
Acts 1:11 who said, Ye men of Galilee, why do ye stand gazing up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in the manner ye have seen Him going into heaven.
Acts 1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey.
Acts 1:13 And when they were come in <transChange>to the city,</transChange> they went up into an upper room, where Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James <transChange>the son</transChange> of Alpheus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude <transChange>the brother</transChange> of James, <transChange>usually</transChange> abode.
Acts 1:14 These all persevered with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brethren.
Acts 1:15 And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, (now the number of the persons <transChange>that were</transChange> together was about an hundred and twenty,)
Acts 1:16 and said, Men <transChange>and</transChange> brethren, it was necessary that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the holy Ghost spake by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was guide to them that apprehended Jesus:
Acts 1:17 for he was numbered with us, and had obtained a part of this ministry.
Acts 1:18 (Now this <transChange>man</transChange> purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling down on his face, burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out:
Acts 1:19 (and it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field is called in their own dialect, Aceldama, that is, the field of blood:)
Acts 1:20 for it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let none dwell in it; and <transChange>again,</transChange> Let another take his office.)
Acts 1:21 Wherefore it is necessary that one of these men, who have been conversant with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and out among us,

Acts 1:25 to take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas is fallen by his transgression, that he might go to his own place.

Acts 2:2 And suddenly there was a sound from heaven as of a strong rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Acts 2:3 And there appeared unto them divided tongues, as it were of fire, and it sat upon each of them:
Acts 2:4 and they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Acts 2:5 Now there were at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.

Acts 2:7 And they were all amazed and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not all these, that are speaking, Galileans?
Acts 2:8 and how do we every one hear them in our own native tongue?
Acts 2:9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those that dwell in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Capadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia,
Acts 2:10 Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers from Rome, Jews and proselytes,

Acts 2:13 but others scoffing said, they are full of sweet wine.
Acts 2:14 But Peter standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said unto them, <transChange>Ye</transChange> men of Judea, and all <transChange>ye</transChange> that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and listen to my words:
Acts 2:15 for these <transChange>men</transChange> are not drunk, as ye suppose; for it is <transChange>but</transChange> the third hour of the day.
Acts 2:16 But this is that <transChange>which was</transChange> spoken of by the prophet Joel,
Acts 2:17 "And it shall come to pass in the last days (saith God) <transChange>that</transChange> I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
Acts 2:18 yea and on my servants and on my handmaids, in those days, I will pour out of my Spirit, and they <transChange>also</transChange> shall prophesy.
Acts 2:19 And I will give prodigies in the heaven, and signs upon the earth; blood, and fire, and smoky vapour.
Acts 2:20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and illustrious day of the Lord come.
Acts 2:21 And whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved."
Acts 2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and prodigies, and signs, which God wrought by Him in the midst of you,
Acts 2:23 (as <transChange>ye</transChange> yourselves also know,) Him being given up by the determinate counsel and fore-knowlege of God ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.
Acts 2:24 Whom God hath raised up again, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.
Acts 2:25 For David saith concerning Him, "I set the Lord always before me, for He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved: therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;

Acts 2:27 that Thou wilt not leave my soul in the invisible state, nor suffer thine holy <transChange>one</transChange> to see corruption.
Acts 2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; <transChange>and</transChange> Thou wilt fill me with joy by <transChange>the light of</transChange> thy countenance."
Acts 2:29 Men <transChange>and</transChange> brethren, allow me to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that he is dead and buried, and his sepulchre is among us to this day.
Acts 2:30 Therefore being a prophet; and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Messiah, to sit on his throne;
Acts 2:31 foreseeing <transChange>this</transChange> he spake of the resurrection of Christ, <transChange>when he said,</transChange> that his soul was not left in the invisible state, nor did his flesh see corruption.
Acts 2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up <transChange>from the dead,</transChange> of which we all are witnesses.

Acts 2:35 Sit <transChange>thou</transChange> at my right <transChange>hand,</transChange> till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
Acts 2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made this very Jesus, whom ye crucified, <transChange>both</transChange> Lord and Christ.
Acts 2:37 Now when they heard <transChange>this,</transChange> they were pricked to the heart, and said unto Peter, and <transChange>to</transChange> the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?
Acts 2:38 And Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of <transChange>your</transChange> sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy Spirit:
Acts 2:39 for the promise is to you and to your children, <transChange>yea</transChange> and to all that are afar off, <transChange>even</transChange> as many as the Lord our God shall call.
Acts 2:40 And with many other words did he press and exhort <transChange>them,</transChange> saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.
Acts 2:41 They therefore that received his word with readiness were baptized: and in that <transChange>same</transChange> day there were added unto <transChange>them</transChange> about three thousand souls.
Acts 2:42 And they continued stedfast in the apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and <transChange>in</transChange> the breaking of bread, and <transChange>in</transChange> prayers.

Acts 3:1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple together at the hour of prayer, <transChange>which is</transChange> the ninth <transChange>hour.</transChange>
Acts 3:2 And a certain man who had been lame from his birth was carried <transChange>along;</transChange> whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, <transChange>which is</transChange> called Beautiful, to ask alms of those that were going into the temple:
Acts 3:3 who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked alms <transChange>of them.</transChange>
Acts 3:4 But Peter, and John, looking earnestly at him said, Look on us.
Acts 3:5 And he fixed <transChange>his eyes</transChange> upon them, expecting to receive something from them.
Acts 3:6 But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.
Acts 3:7 And taking him by the right hand, he raised <transChange>him</transChange> up: and immediately his feet and ancles were strengthened:
Acts 3:8 and leaping up he stood <transChange>firm,</transChange> and walked; and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
Acts 3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
Acts 3:10 and knew that it was he who sat <transChange>to ask</transChange> for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with astonishment and extasy at what had befallen him.
Acts 3:11 And as the lame <transChange>man</transChange> that was healed had hold of Peter and John, all the people being astonished ran together to them to the porch called Solomon's <transChange>porch.</transChange>
Acts 3:12 And Peter seeing <transChange>this</transChange> said to the people, Men of Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye <transChange>so</transChange> earnestly on us, as if by our own power or piety we had made this <transChange>man able</transChange> to walk?
Acts 3:13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and denied before Pilate, when he determined to release <transChange>Him.</transChange>
Acts 3:14 But ye refused the holy and righteous <transChange>One,</transChange> and desired a murderer to be granted unto you:
Acts 3:15 and put to death the prince of life; whom God hath raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
Acts 3:16 And through faith in his name, hath strengthened this <transChange>man,</transChange> whom ye see and know: his name, <transChange>I say,</transChange> and saith in Him, hath wrought this perfect cure before you all.
Acts 3:17 And now, brethren, I know that ye did it through ignorance, as <transChange>did</transChange> also your rulers:
Acts 3:18 but thus hath God accomplished those things which He had foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer.
Acts 3:19 Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out: that seasons of refreshing may come <transChange>upon you</transChange> from the presence of the Lord;
Acts 3:20 and He may send Jesus Christ, who was before preached unto you:
Acts 3:21 whom heaven must indeed receive till the times of settling all things, of which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets from the beginning.
Acts 3:22 For Moses said unto the fathers, the Lord your God will raise up a prophet unto you, of your brethren, <transChange>like</transChange> me, Him shall ye hear in all <transChange>things</transChange> whatever He shall say unto you;
Acts 3:23 and every soul, who will not hearken to that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people: yea and all the prophets from Samuel,
Acts 3:24 and those that followed, as many as have prophesied, have also foretold these days.
Acts 3:25 <transChange>Now</transChange> ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant, which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed:"
Acts 3:26 <transChange>and</transChange> to you first God having raised up his son Jesus, sent Him to bless you; in <transChange>your</transChange> turning away every one of you from your iniquities. <chapter eID="gen3949" osisID="Acts.3"/>

Acts 4:1 And while they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the sadducees came upon them,
Acts 4:2 being vexed that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts 4:3 And they laid hands on them, and put them into custody till the next day: for it was now evening.
Acts 4:4 But many of them who heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was about five thousand.
Acts 4:5 And on the morrow their rulers, and elders, and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem:
Acts 4:6 and <transChange>with them</transChange> Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
Acts 4:7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked <transChange>them,</transChange> By what power, or in what name have ye done this?
Acts 4:8 Then Peter filled with the holy Spirit said unto them, Ye rulers of the people,
Acts 4:9 and elders of Israel, if we are this day examined about the benefit done to the impotent man,
Acts 4:10 by what <transChange>means</transChange> he is cured, be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, <transChange>but</transChange> whom God hath raised from the dead, <transChange>even</transChange> by Him doth this <transChange>man</transChange> stand <transChange>here</transChange> before you whole.
Acts 4:11 This is the stone that was set at nought by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
Acts 4:12 And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we can be saved.
Acts 4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were plain and illiterate men, they were amazed; and they knew them again that they had been with Jesus:
Acts 4:14 but seeing the man that was cured standing with them, they had nothing to say against <transChange>it.</transChange>
Acts 4:15 Therefore they ordered them to withdraw from the council,
Acts 4:16 and conferred among themselves, saying, What shall we do with these men? for that indeed an evident miracle hath been wrought by them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny <transChange>it.</transChange>
Acts 4:17 But that it may spread no farther among the people, let us severely charge them to speak no more to any man in this name.
Acts 4:18 So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.
Acts 4:19 But Peter and John answered them, and said, Whether it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather than God, judge <transChange>ye:</transChange>
Acts 4:20 for we cannot but speak <transChange>the things</transChange> which we have seen and heard.
Acts 4:21 So they threatened them more <transChange>severely,</transChange> and let them go; not finding how to punish them, because of the people: for they all glorified God for that which was done.
Acts 4:22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miraculous cure was wrought.
Acts 4:23 Being dismissed they went to their own <transChange>company,</transChange> and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
Acts 4:24 And when they heard <transChange>it,</transChange> they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, Thou <transChange>art</transChange> God, who hast made heaven and earth, and sea, and all <transChange>things</transChange> therein:
Acts 4:25 who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain <transChange>things?</transChange>
Acts 4:26 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his anointed.
Acts 4:27 For of a truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, <transChange>the</transChange> Gentiles and <transChange>the</transChange> people of Israel, combined against thy holy child Jesus,
Acts 4:28 (whom Thou hast anointed,) to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had before determined to be done.
Acts 4:29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings; and give unto thy servants to speak thy word with all freedom, while Thou art stretching forth thy hand to heal,
Acts 4:30 and <transChange>while</transChange> signs and wonders are done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
Acts 4:31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with freedom.
Acts 4:32 And the heart and soul of the multitude that believed was one: no one called any of his possessions his own <transChange>property,</transChange> but they had all <transChange>things</transChange> common.
Acts 4:33 And with great power did the apostles give <transChange>their</transChange> testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
Acts 4:34 Neither was there any indigent <transChange>person</transChange> among them; for as many as were proprietors of lands or houses, sold them and brought the prices of what were sold,
Acts 4:35 and laid them at the apostles feet; and distribution was made to every <transChange>one</transChange> according to their necessity.
Acts 4:36 So Joses <transChange>who was</transChange> by the apostles sirnamed Barnabas, which is a son of consolation,
Acts 4:37 a Levite, by birth a Cyprian, having an estate, sold <transChange>it</transChange> and brought the money, and laid <transChange>it</transChange> at the feet of the apostles. <chapter eID="gen3976" osisID="Acts.4"/>

Acts 5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, <transChange>together</transChange> with Sapphira his wife,
Acts 5:2 sold a possession, and secreted part of the price, his wife also being conscious <transChange>to it;</transChange> and bringing: some part, laid <transChange>it</transChange> at the feet of the apostles.
Acts 5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan <transChange>so</transChange> filled thine heart, that thou shouldst lie to the holy Ghost, and keep back <transChange>part</transChange> of the price of the land?
Acts 5:4 While it remained, did it not remain thy own? and <transChange>when</transChange> sold, was <transChange>it not</transChange> in thy own power? what <transChange>is the meaning</transChange> that thou hast taken this into thine heart? Thou hast not lyed to men, but to God.
Acts 5:5 And Ananias <transChange>at the</transChange> hearing <transChange>of</transChange> these words fell down and expired: and great fear came on all that heard these <transChange>things.</transChange>
Acts 5:6 And <transChange>some of</transChange> the young <transChange>men</transChange> arose, and wrapped him up; and they carried <transChange>him</transChange> out, and buried <transChange>him.</transChange>
Acts 5:7 And about the space of three hours after, his wife also came in, not knowing what had happened.
Acts 5:8 And Peter said to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.
Acts 5:9 Then Peter said unto her, Wherefore have ye agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold the feet of those, who have been burying thy husband, <transChange>now</transChange> at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
Acts 5:10 And immediately she fell down at his feet and expired: and the young men coming in found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
Acts 5:11 And great fear came upon the whole assembly, and upon all that heard these things.
Acts 5:12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people: And they all met with one accord in Solomon's portico:
Acts 5:13 but no other presumed to join himself to them; however the people magnified them.
Acts 5:14 And <transChange>true</transChange> believers were the more <transChange>willingly</transChange> added to the Lord, <transChange>even</transChange> multitudes both of men and women.
Acts 5:15 insomuch that they brought the sick out into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at lest the shadow of Peter, as he came by, might pass over some of them.
Acts 5:16 And a great number <transChange>out</transChange> of the cities round about also came together to Jerusalem, bringing those that were infirm and <transChange>that were</transChange> troubled with impure spirits; and they were all cured.
Acts 5:17 Then the high priest rose up, and all <transChange>that were</transChange> with him, (being <transChange>of</transChange> the sect of the sadducees,) and were filled with rage:
Acts 5:18 and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.
Acts 5:19 But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison by night, and having brought them out said,
Acts 5:20 "Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
Acts 5:21 And hearing <transChange>this,</transChange> they went early in the morning into the temple and taught <transChange>the people.</transChange> But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, <transChange>to the council-chamber,</transChange> they called together the Sanhedrim, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent <transChange>orders</transChange> to the prison that they should be brought <transChange>before them.</transChange>
Acts 5:22 But when the officers came they found them not in the prison: so they returned,
Acts 5:23 and told <transChange>them,</transChange> saying, the prison we found shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we opened <transChange>them,</transChange> we found no body within.
Acts 5:24 Now when the <transChange>high</transChange> priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt concerning them, what this would come to;
Acts 5:25 when there came one and told them, saying, behold, the men whom ye put in prison, are in the temple teaching the people.
Acts 5:26 Then the captain went with the officers and brought them, <transChange>but</transChange> not with violence; for they were afraid of the people least they should be stoned:
Acts 5:27 and when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
Acts 5:28 saying, Did not we strictly charge you not to teach in this name? and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring this man's blood upon us.
Acts 5:29 But Peter, and the <transChange>other</transChange> apostles, answered, and said, <transChange>We</transChange> ought to obey God rather than men.
Acts 5:30 The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
Acts 5:31 Him hath God exalted <transChange>with</transChange> his right hand <transChange>as</transChange> a prince and saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins:
Acts 5:32 and we are his witnesses of what we declare; and so <transChange>is</transChange> the holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey Him.
Acts 5:33 And when they heard <transChange>this,</transChange> they were cut <transChange>to the heart,</transChange> and took counsel to put them to death.
Acts 5:34 But a certain pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, held in <transChange>much</transChange> esteem by all the people, stood up in the council, and ordered the apostles to be taken out a little while; and <transChange>then</transChange> he said unto them,
Acts 5:35 Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves, what ye are about to do, as to these men.
Acts 5:36 For some time ago one Theudas arose, pretending to be some <transChange>extraordinary person,</transChange> to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred: who was slain, and all that followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
Acts 5:37 After him arose Judas the Galilean, at the time of the registring, and drew much people after him: <transChange>but</transChange> he also perished, and all that followed him were dispersed.
Acts 5:38 And <transChange>therefore</transChange> as to the present affair I advise you <transChange>to</transChange> refrain from these men and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing;
Acts 5:39 but if it be of God, ye cannot defeat it, least ye be found fighting even against God.
Acts 5:40 So they took his advice, and having called for the apostles and scourged <transChange>them,</transChange> they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
Acts 5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer disgrace for his name.
Acts 5:42 And every day in the temple and from house to house they ceased not <transChange>from</transChange> teaching and preaching <transChange>that</transChange> Jesus <transChange>was</transChange> the Christ. <chapter eID="gen4014" osisID="Acts.5"/>
Acts 6:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.6" sID="gen4057"/>
Acts 6:1 Now in those days, as the number of disciples increased, there rose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution.
Acts 6:2 So the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to <transChange>them</transChange> and said, It is not seemly that we should leave the word of God and attend at tables.
Acts 6:3 Wherefore, brethren, look out from among you seven men of good character, full of the holy Spirit, and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this matter:
Acts 6:4 but we will constantly attend to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
Acts 6:5 And the advice pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch.
Acts 6:6 These they set before the apostles; who, when they had prayed, laid <transChange>their</transChange> hands upon them.
Acts 6:7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly multiplied; and a great number of the priests became obedient to the faith.
Acts 6:8 Now Stephen <transChange>being</transChange> full of grace and power, wrought miracles and great signs among the people.
Acts 6:9 But there rose up some of the synagogue, which is called <transChange>that</transChange> of the libertines, and <transChange>some</transChange> of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia, and Asia, to dispute with Stephen:
Acts 6:10 and they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spake.
Acts 6:11 Then they suborned men to say, we heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and <transChange>against</transChange> God.
Acts 6:12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon <transChange>him,</transChange> and forced him along with <transChange>them,</transChange> and brought <transChange>him</transChange> to the council:
Acts 6:13 and they set up false witnesses; who said, This man is continually speaking blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law.
Acts 6:14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and change the rites which Moses delivered to us.
Acts 6:15 (And all that were sitting in the council, looking stedfastly at him, saw his face like the face of an angel.) <chapter eID="gen4057" osisID="Acts.6"/>
Acts 7:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.7" sID="gen4073"/>
Acts 7:1 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
Acts 7:2 And he said, "Brethren and fathers, hearken,---The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
Acts 7:3 and said to him, Depart from thy <transChange>native</transChange> country and from thy kindred, and come into the country which I shall shew thee.
Acts 7:4 Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, after his father died, He removed him into this land in which ye now dwell:
Acts 7:5 though He gave him no inheritance in it, no not the breadth of a foot; but He promised to give it to him for a possession, even to his seed after him; though he had <transChange>then</transChange> no child."
Acts 7:6 And God spake thus <transChange>unto him,</transChange> "that his seed should sojourn in a strange country, and they shall in slave and abuse them four hundred years:"
Acts 7:7 and God said, "I will judge the nation, to which they shall be in slavery; and afterwards they shall come out, and shall worship me in this place."
Acts 7:8 And He gave him the covenant of circumcision: and he begat Isaac, and circumcised him <transChange>on</transChange> the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
Acts 7:9 And the patriarchs, envying <transChange>him,</transChange> sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
Acts 7:10 and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he appointed him governor over Egypt, and <transChange>over</transChange> all his houshold.
Acts 7:11 And there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction; and our fathers could not find sustenance.
Acts 7:12 But Jacob hearing that there was corn in Egypt, sent out our fathers first:
Acts 7:13 and at the second <transChange>time</transChange> Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known to Pharaoh.
Acts 7:14 Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and all his kindred, even seventy-five souls.
Acts 7:15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died <transChange>there,</transChange> he and our fathers:
Acts 7:16 and were carried to Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre which he had bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor <transChange>the father</transChange> of Sychem.
Acts 7:17 But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt.
Acts 7:18 Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph. This <transChange>king</transChange> formed crafty schemes against our nation,
Acts 7:19 and oppressed our fathers, causing their children to be exposed, that their race might be extinguished.
Acts 7:20 In which time Moses was born, who was exceeding beautiful, and he was nourished up in his father's house three months: and when he was exposed,
Acts 7:21 Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son.
Acts 7:22 And Moses was trained up in all the wisdom of the Egyptians: and he was mighty in words, and in deeds.
Acts 7:23 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
Acts 7:24 And seeing one of them injured he defended <transChange>him,</transChange> and smiting the Egyptian he avenged him that was wronged.
Acts 7:25 Now he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would give them deliverance by his hand: but they understood not.
Acts 7:26 And the next day he came to them, as they were <transChange>two of them</transChange> fighting, and <transChange>would have</transChange> persuaded them to agree, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren, why do ye injure one another?
Acts 7:27 But he, that injured his neighbor, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
Acts 7:28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
Acts 7:29 Upon this Moses fled, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
Acts 7:30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
Acts 7:31 Now Moses, when he saw it, was amazed at the sight; and as he came near to observe it, there was a voice of the Lord to him,
Acts 7:32 <transChange>saying,</transChange> "I <transChange>am</transChange> the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;" but Moses trembling durst not look on.
Acts 7:33 And the Lord said to him, "Take off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.
Acts 7:34 I have seen the oppression of my people <transChange>that are</transChange> in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. Therefore come now, and I will send thee into Egypt."
Acts 7:35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? did God send, by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush, <transChange>to be their</transChange> ruler and deliverer.
Acts 7:36 <transChange>And</transChange> he brought them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wilderness, forty years.
Acts 7:37 ---This is that Moses who said unto the children of Israel, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear."
Acts 7:38 This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel that spake to him on mount Sinai, and <transChange>with</transChange> our fathers; <transChange>and</transChange> who received the oracles of life to give unto us.
Acts 7:39 To whom our fathers would not be subject, but renounced <transChange>him,</transChange> and in their hearts turned <transChange>back</transChange> into Egypt,
Acts 7:40 saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for <transChange>as to</transChange> this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. And they made a calf in those days,
Acts 7:41 and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
Acts 7:42 Then God turned <transChange>away,</transChange> and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, "O house of Israel, did ye offer to me <transChange>your</transChange> victims and sacrifices, for <transChange>the space of</transChange> forty years in the wilderness?
Acts 7:43 yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them <transChange>by:</transChange> and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
Acts 7:44 The tabernacle of witness was among our fathers in the wilderness, as He, that spake unto Moses, ordered <transChange>him</transChange> to make it according to the model which he had seen <transChange>in the mount:</transChange>
Acts 7:45 and which our fathers receiving, <transChange>they</transChange> with Joshua, brought into the territory of the nations, whom God drove out from before the face of our fathers, till the days of David, who found favor in the sight of God,
Acts 7:46 and was desirous to provide an habitation for the God of Jacob.
Acts 7:47 But Solomon built Him an house.
Acts 7:48 Though the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as the prophet saith,
Acts 7:49 "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what house will ye build for me, saith the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
Acts 7:50 hath not my hand made all these <transChange>things?</transChange>" ---
Acts 7:51 Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the holy Spirit: as your fathers <transChange>did,</transChange> so <transChange>do</transChange> ye.
Acts 7:52 Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and slew those who prophesied concerning the coming of that righteous <transChange>One,</transChange> of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers;
Acts 7:53 who received the law by the ministration of angels, and <transChange>yet</transChange> have not kept <transChange>it.</transChange>
Acts 7:54 And when they heard these <transChange>things,</transChange> they were cut to the heart and gnashed <transChange>their</transChange> teeth at him.
Acts 7:55 But he being full of the holy Spirit looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right <transChange>hand</transChange> of God:
Acts 7:56 and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right <transChange>hand</transChange> of God.
Acts 7:57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
Acts 7:58 and cast <transChange>him</transChange> out of the city and stoned <transChange>him:</transChange> and the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.
Acts 7:59 And they stoned Stephen calling upon <transChange>God,</transChange> and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
Acts 7:60 And bending his knees, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this he fell asleep. <chapter eID="gen4073" osisID="Acts.7"/>
Acts 8:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.8" sID="gen4134"/>
Acts 8:1 And Saul was well pleased with his execution. For at that time there was a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all dispersed through the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Acts 8:2 And <transChange>some</transChange> pious men carried Stephen <transChange>to his burial,</transChange> and made great lamentation for him.
Acts 8:3 But Saul made havock of the church, entring into the houses, and dragging <transChange>out</transChange> men and women, committed <transChange>them</transChange> to prison.
Acts 8:4 Now they that were dispersed went about preaching the word.
Acts 8:5 And Philip coming to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.
Acts 8:6 And the people unanimously attended to the things which were spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he wrought:
Acts 8:7 for impure spirits crying with a loud voice came out of many that were possessed <transChange>by them;</transChange> and many paralytic and lame <transChange>persons</transChange> were cured.
Acts 8:8 And there was great joy in that city.
Acts 8:9 But there was before in the city a man named Simon practising magic and bewitching the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great <transChange>person.</transChange>
Acts 8:10 Whom they all <transChange>greatly</transChange> regarded, from the lest to the greatest, saying, This <transChange>man</transChange> is <transChange>as</transChange> the great power of God.
Acts 8:11 And they were attentive to him, because he had for a considerable time astonished them by <transChange>his</transChange> magic <transChange>arts.</transChange>
Acts 8:12 But as they believed Philip, preaching the <transChange>things</transChange> concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women;
Acts 8:13 and Simon himself also believed, and was baptized, and kept constantly with Philip: and beholding the signs and miracles <transChange>that were</transChange> wrought, he was amazed.
Acts 8:14 Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:
Acts 8:15 who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy Spirit: (for He was not yet fallen upon any of them,
Acts 8:16 only they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus:) <transChange>and</transChange> then they laid <transChange>their</transChange> hands on them,
Acts 8:17 and they received the holy Spirit.
Acts 8:18 And when Simon saw that the holy Spirit was given by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,
Acts 8:19 saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the holy Spirit.
Acts 8:20 But Peter said unto him, Let thy money perish with thee, since thou thoughtest to purchase the gift of God with money.
Acts 8:21 Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
Acts 8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if so be the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee:
Acts 8:23 for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity.
Acts 8:24 And Simon answered, and said, Do ye pray to the Lord for me, that none <transChange>of the things</transChange> which ye have spoken may come upon me.
Acts 8:25 And they having testified and declared the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
Acts 8:26 And an angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise and go southward to the way that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.
Acts 8:27 And he arose and went; and behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, and her high-treasurer, who had come to Jerusalem to worship,
Acts 8:28 was returning, and as he sat in his chariot, was reading the prophet Esaias:
Acts 8:29 and the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot. And Philip running <transChange>up</transChange> to <transChange>him,</transChange>
Acts 8:30 heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said, Dost thou understand what thou readest?
Acts 8:31 And he said, How can I, unless some one guide me? and he desired Philip to come up and sit with him.
Acts 8:32 And the portion of scripture, which he was reading, was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before it's shearer <transChange>is</transChange> dumb, so He opened not his mouth:
Acts 8:33 in his humiliation his judgement was taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth."
Acts 8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom doth the prophet say this? of himself, or of some other <transChange>person?</transChange>
Acts 8:35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.
Acts 8:36 And as they went on <transChange>their</transChange> way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See <transChange>here is</transChange> water, what hindereth me from being baptized?
Acts 8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
Acts 8:38 And he ordered the chariot to stop: and they both went down to the water, Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
Acts 8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: but went on his way rejoicing.
Acts 8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus; and as he passed along, he preached the gospel in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea. <chapter eID="gen4134" osisID="Acts.8"/>
Acts 9:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.9" sID="gen4175"/>
Acts 9:1 But Saul still breathing <transChange>out</transChange> threatnings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest, and desired of him letters to the synagogues at Damascus,
Acts 9:2 that if he should find any of this persuasion, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
Acts 9:3 And as he was on his journey, and came near to Damascus, suddenly there shone <transChange>round</transChange> about him a light from heaven;
Acts 9:4 and he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</q>
Acts 9:5 And he said, Who art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am Jesus <transChange>the Nazarene</transChange> whom thou art persecuting: <transChange>it is</transChange> hard for thee to kick against the goads.</q>
Acts 9:6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee, what thou must do.</q>
Acts 9:7 And the men that went along with him, stood astonished, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
Acts 9:8 And Saul rose from the earth, but when he opened his eyes he could not see: so they led him by the hand, and brought him to Damascus.
Acts 9:9 And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.
Acts 9:10 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Ananias,</q> and he said, Behold, I <transChange>am here,</transChange> Lord.
Acts 9:11 And the Lord <transChange>said</transChange> unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Arise and go into the street which is called Strait, and enquire in the house of Judas for <transChange>one</transChange> Saul, of Tarsus:</q>
Acts 9:12 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for behold he is praying, and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in and putting <transChange>his</transChange> hand upon him, that he might recover his sight.</q>
Acts 9:13 And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much mischief he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
Acts 9:14 and here <transChange>too</transChange> he hath authority from the chief priests to apprehend all that call upon thy name.
Acts 9:15 But the Lord said unto him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go thy way, for he is the instrument I have chosen, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</q>
Acts 9:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for I will shew him how great <transChange>sufferings</transChange> he must endure for my name.</q>
Acts 9:17 And Ananias went away and came into the house; and putting his hands on him, said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, <transChange>even</transChange> Jesus, who appeared to thee on the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy Spirit."
Acts 9:18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales; and he instantly recovered his sight, and arose and was baptized.
Acts 9:19 And when he had taken <transChange>some</transChange> nourishment, he was strengthened. Now Saul was with the disciples at Damascus <transChange>for</transChange> some time.
Acts 9:20 And he immediately preached Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.
Acts 9:21 But all that heard him, were amazed, and said, Is not this he that persecuted those in Jerusalem who called on this name, and came hither for this end, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?
Acts 9:22 But Saul prevailed more <transChange>and more,</transChange> and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, fully proving that this <transChange>same Jesus</transChange> is the Christ.
Acts 9:23 And after a considerable time, the Jews conspired to kill him:
Acts 9:24 but Saul was apprised of their design. And they watched the gates day and night, to make away with him:
Acts 9:25 but the disciples took him by night, and let <transChange>him</transChange> down by the wall, in a basket.
Acts 9:26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
Acts 9:27 But Barnabas took and brought him to the apostles, and related to them, how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him; and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
Acts 9:28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and preaching openly in the name of the Lord Jesus:
Acts 9:29 and he talked and disputed with the Hellenists, who attempted to kill him:
Acts 9:30 but when the brethren knew <transChange>it,</transChange> they brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.
Acts 9:31 Then the churches throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had rest, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord; and through the consolation of the holy Spirit were multiplied.
Acts 9:32 And it came to pass that as Peter was going through all <transChange>parts,</transChange> he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
Acts 9:33 And there he found a man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, with the palsy.
Acts 9:34 And Peter said unto him, Eneas, Jesus the Messiah, healeth thee. Arise, and make thy bed. And he rose up immediately.
Acts 9:35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and <transChange>in</transChange> Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
Acts 9:36 And there was at Joppa a certain female disciple named Tabitha, who by interpretation is called <transChange>in Greek</transChange> Dorcas: <transChange>and</transChange> she was full of good works and alms-deeds.
Acts 9:37 And it happened, about the same time, that she fell sick and died: and when they had washed her they laid her <transChange>out</transChange> in an upper chamber.
Acts 9:38 And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men to him, intreating <transChange>him</transChange> that he would not delay to come to them.
Acts 9:39 Then Peter arose, and went with them: and when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood round him weeping, and shewing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made when she was with them.
Acts 9:40 But Peter, putting them all out, kneeled down and prayed: and <transChange>then</transChange> turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
Acts 9:41 And giving her <transChange>his</transChange> hand he raised her up, and calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.
Acts 9:42 And it was <transChange>soon</transChange> known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.
Acts 9:43 And he staid many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner. <chapter eID="gen4175" osisID="Acts.9"/>
Acts 10:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.10" sID="gen4219"/>
Acts 10:1 Now there was a certain man at Cesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian <transChange>band:</transChange> a pious man,
Acts 10:2 and one that feared God, with all his house; giving also much alms to the people, and praying to God continually.
Acts 10:3 He evidently saw in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius!
Acts 10:4 and he looking earnestly at him, and being afraid, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up as a memorial before God.
Acts 10:5 And now send men to Joppa, and fetch hither <transChange>one</transChange> Simon, whose sirname is Peter.
Acts 10:6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea-<transChange>side:</transChange> he shall tell thee what thou must do.
Acts 10:7 As soon as the angel, that spake to Cornelius, was departed, he called two of his domestic servants, and a devout soldier, that constantly attended him.
Acts 10:8 And when he had related all to them, he sent them to Joppa.
Acts 10:9 On the morrow, while they were on their journey, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the top of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.
Acts 10:10 And he was very hungry, and desired <transChange>something</transChange> to eat: but while they were getting <transChange>it</transChange> ready, he fell into a trance; and saw heaven opened,
Acts 10:11 and some thing descending to him, like a great sheet tied at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
Acts 10:12 in which were all kinds of four-footed creatures, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
Acts 10:13 And there was a voice <transChange>which said</transChange> to him, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</q>
Acts 10:14 But Peter said, By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing polluted or unclean.
Acts 10:15 And the voice <transChange>said</transChange> to him again the second time, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What God hath cleansed, do not thou account polluted.</q>
Acts 10:16 This was done thrice, and the vessel was taken up again into heaven.
Acts 10:17 Now while Peter was doubting in himself what might be <transChange>the meaning</transChange> of the vision which he had seen, behold the men that were sent from Cornelius, having enquired for Simon's house, stood at the door;
Acts 10:18 and called, and asked, if Simon sirnamed Peter lodged there.
Acts 10:19 And as Peter was pondering upon the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold there are three men enquiring for thee:
Acts 10:20 arise therefore and go down, and go along with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.
Acts 10:21 Then Peter went down to the men that were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold I am <transChange>the person</transChange> whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye are come?
Acts 10:22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man, and one that feareth God, and of a good character among all the nation of the Jews, hath been warned from God by an holy angel, to send for thee to his house, and to hear what thou shalt say.
Acts 10:23 Then he invited them in, and entertained <transChange>them that night.</transChange> And on the morrow Peter set out with them; and some of the brethren from Joppa went with him.
Acts 10:24 And the next day they came into Cesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relations and intimate friends.
Acts 10:25 And as Peter came in, Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet did <transChange>him</transChange> reverence.
Acts 10:26 But Peter raised him up, saying, I myself also am a man.
Acts 10:27 And <transChange>as he was</transChange> conversing with him, he went in, and found many assembled together.
Acts 10:28 And he said unto them, Ye know how unlawful it is for a man that is a Jew, to associate with or go to <transChange>the house of</transChange> one of another nation: but God hath shewn me, that I should not call any man polluted or unclean.
Acts 10:29 And therefore I came <transChange>to you,</transChange> when I was sent for, without demur. I ask therefore on what account ye sent for me.
Acts 10:30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, when behold a man stood before me in bright raiment,
Acts 10:31 and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are remembered before God.
Acts 10:32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, who is sirnamed Peter, (he lodgeth in the house of <transChange>one</transChange> Simon a tanner, by the sea-<transChange>side,</transChange>) who when he cometh, will talk with thee.
Acts 10:33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well that thou art come. And now we are all here present before God, to hear all the things which God hath charged thee with <transChange>to us.</transChange>
Acts 10:34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
Acts 10:35 but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to Him.
Acts 10:36 <transChange>According to</transChange> the declaration which He made to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
Acts 10:37 Ye know the report that was <transChange>spread</transChange> through all Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached: <transChange>concerning</transChange> Jesus of Nazareth,
Acts 10:38 how God anointed Him with the holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil: for God was with Him.
Acts 10:39 And we are witnesses of all <transChange>things</transChange> that He did, both in the country of Judea, and in <transChange>the city of</transChange> Jerusalem: whom <transChange>notwithstanding</transChange> they put to death, hanging <transChange>Him</transChange> on a tree.
Acts 10:40 Him God raised up the third day, and gave Him to be seen openly; not to all the people,
Acts 10:41 but to witnesses before appointed by God, <transChange>even</transChange> to us, who did eat and drink with Him, after He rose from the dead.
Acts 10:42 And He commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He who is appointed by God <transChange>to be</transChange> judge of the living and of the dead.
Acts 10:43 To Him do all the prophets bear witness, that whosoever believeth on Him shall receive the forgiveness of <transChange>their</transChange> sins through his name.
Acts 10:44 While Peter was yet speaking these words, the holy Spirit fell upon all them that heard the word.
Acts 10:45 And those of the circumcision <transChange>that were</transChange> believers, who came with Peter, were astonished, that the gift of the holy Spirit was conferred upon the Gentiles also:
Acts 10:46 for they heard them speaking in <transChange>divers</transChange> languages, and glorifying God.
Acts 10:47 Then said Peter, Can any one forbid water, that these <transChange>persons</transChange> should not be baptized, who have received the holy Spirit, as well as we?
Acts 10:48 And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. And they desired him to stay <transChange>there</transChange> some days. <chapter eID="gen4219" osisID="Acts.10"/>
Acts 11:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.11" sID="gen4268"/>
Acts 11:1 Now the apostles and brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts 11:2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, those <transChange>that were</transChange> of the circumcision contended with him, saying,
Acts 11:3 Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them.
Acts 11:4 But Peter began and laid <transChange>the matter</transChange> in order before them,
Acts 11:5 saying, I was praying in the city <transChange>of</transChange> Joppa; and in a trance I saw a vision, some thing like a large sheet descending from heaven, let down by the four corners; and it came close to me.
Acts 11:6 And looking stedfastly upon it, I observed four-footed creatures and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air.
Acts 11:7 And I heard a voice saying to me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</q>
Acts 11:8 But I said, By no means, Lord: for nothing polluted or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.
Acts 11:9 And the voice answered me a second time from heaven, <q marker="" who="Jesus">What God hath cleansed do not thou call polluted.</q>
Acts 11:10 And this was done thrice: and <transChange>then</transChange> they were all drawn up again to heaven.
Acts 11:11 And behold at that very time there came three men to the house where I was, sent from Cesarea to me.
Acts 11:12 And the Spirit ordered me to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brethren also came with me, and we entred into the man's house;
Acts 11:13 and he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and fetch hither Simon,
Acts 11:14 whose sirname is Peter, who will tell thee things, by which thou shalt be saved and all thy family.
Acts 11:15 And when I began to speak, the holy Spirit fell on them, even as <transChange>it did</transChange> upon us at the beginning.
Acts 11:16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the holy Spirit.</q>
Acts 11:17 As therefore God gave to them the like gift that <transChange>He did</transChange> to us, upon our believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, <transChange>that I should be</transChange> able to withstand God?
Acts 11:18 And when they heard these things they acquiesced, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God given to the Gentiles also repentance unto life.
Acts 11:19 Now they that were dispersed by the trouble, which arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but the Jews only.
Acts 11:20 But some of them were Cyprians, and Cyrenians, who when they came to Antioch, discoursed with the Grecians <transChange>also,</transChange> preaching the Lord Jesus.
Acts 11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
Acts 11:22 And the report of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem; and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
Acts 11:23 Who, when he was come, and saw the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted them all with steadiness of heart to adhere to the Lord.
Acts 11:24 For he was a good man, and full of the holy Spirit, and of faith: and many were added unto the Lord.
Acts 11:25 Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to seek Saul: and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.
Acts 11:26 And they assembled in the church a whole year, and taught much people: and the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.
Acts 11:27 And in these days came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts 11:28 And one of them, named Agabus, stood up and signified by the Spirit, that there would be a great famine over all the earth: which accordingly came to pass in the reign of Claudius Cesar.
Acts 11:29 And each of the disciples, according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea.
Acts 11:30 Which they also did, sending <transChange>it</transChange> to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. <chapter eID="gen4268" osisID="Acts.11"/>
Acts 12:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.12" sID="gen4299"/>
Acts 12:1 About that time Herod the king exerted his power to distress some of the church.
Acts 12:2 And he cut off James, the brother of John, with the sword.
Acts 12:3 And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to apprehend Peter also, (in the days of unleavened bread:)
Acts 12:4 whom he seized and put into prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending, after the passover, to bring him out to the people.
Acts 12:5 Peter was therefore kept in custody: but incessant prayer was made to God for him by the church.
Acts 12:6 And when Herod was about to bring him forth, that <transChange>very</transChange> night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the guards at the door watched the prison.
Acts 12:7 And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the room; and smiting Peter on the side, he waked him, and said, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from <transChange>his</transChange> hands.
Acts 12:8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself and tie on thy sandals: and he did so. And he saith unto him, Throw thy garment round thee, and follow me.
Acts 12:9 So he went out and followed him; and he did not know, that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision.
Acts 12:10 And passing through the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate, that leadeth into the city, which of its own accord opened to them: and they went out and passed on through one street; and then the angel departed from him.
Acts 12:11 And Peter being come to himself said, Now I know truly, that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me from the hand of Herod, and <transChange>from</transChange> all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
Acts 12:12 And considering with <transChange>himself,</transChange> he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, <transChange>who was</transChange> sirnamed Mark, where many were gathered together and praying.
Acts 12:13 And when Peter knocked at the door of the porch, a servant named Rhoda came to ask who was there.
Acts 12:14 And knowing Peter's voice, through <transChange>excess of</transChange> joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told <transChange>them,</transChange> that Peter was standing at the door.
Acts 12:15 And they said to her, Thou art mad: but she confidently affirmed that it was so. Then said they, It is his angel.
Acts 12:16 But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened <transChange>the door,</transChange> they saw him, and were astonished.
Acts 12:17 But he made a sign to them with <transChange>his</transChange> hand to be silent, and related to them, how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go, tell these things to James and to the <transChange>other</transChange> brethren. And he departed and went to another place.
Acts 12:18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
Acts 12:19 And Herod searching for him, and not finding <transChange>him,</transChange> brought the keepers to a trial, and ordered them to be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Cesarea, and abode <transChange>there.</transChange>
Acts 12:20 And Herod was going to make war upon the Tyrians and Sidonians: but they came to him with one consent, and making interest with Blastus the king's chamberlain, they sued for peace; because their territory was supplied with provision by the king's <transChange>country.</transChange>
Acts 12:21 And upon a set day, Herod arrayed in <transChange>his</transChange> royal robes, and sitting upon his throne, made an oration to them.
Acts 12:22 And the people gave a shout, <transChange>saying, It is</transChange> the voice of a god, and not of a man:
Acts 12:23 but immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and being devoured by worms he died.
Acts 12:24 But the word of God grew and was multiplied.
Acts 12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their charge, taking along with them John <transChange>who was</transChange> sirnamed Mark. <chapter eID="gen4299" osisID="Acts.12"/>
Acts 13:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.13" sID="gen4325"/>
Acts 13:1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers, as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenean, and Manaen who had been educated with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul;
Acts 13:2 and as they were ministring to the Lord, and fasting, the holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.
Acts 13:3 Then having fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent <transChange>them</transChange> away.
Acts 13:4 These therefore being sent forth by the holy Spirit came down to Seleucia, and from thence they sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts 13:5 And when they arrived at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John for <transChange>their</transChange> assistant.
Acts 13:6 And going <transChange>quite</transChange> through the island even to Paphos, they found <transChange>there</transChange> a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus.
Acts 13:7 Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an understanding man: who calling for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.
Acts 13:8 But Elymas the magician (for so his name signifies) withstood them endeavouring to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
Acts 13:9 Then Saul, who also <transChange>is called</transChange> Paul, being filled with the holy Spirit, and looking earnestly at him,
Acts 13:10 said, O thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, <transChange>who art</transChange> full of all deceit and craft, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
Acts 13:11 And now behold, the hand of the Lord <transChange>is</transChange> upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing <transChange>even</transChange> the sun for a time. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and groping about he sought for some<transChange>body</transChange> to lead him by the hand.
Acts 13:12 Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed, being struck <transChange>with admiration</transChange> at the doctrine of the Lord.
Acts 13:13 Now Paul and those that were with him loosing from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia: but John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
Acts 13:14 And they passing on from Perga came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sat down.
Acts 13:15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation to the people, deliver <transChange>it.</transChange>

Acts 13:23 Of this man's seed, according to the promise, hath God raised up to Israel Jesus the Saviour:
Acts 13:24 John having preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Acts 13:25 And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom do ye take me to be? I am not <transChange>He:</transChange> but behold there cometh <transChange>one</transChange> after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.
Acts 13:26 ---Men <transChange>and</transChange> brethren, children of the race of Abraham, and <transChange>all</transChange> those among you that fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
Acts 13:27 For the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and their rulers, not knowing Him, have indeed fulfilled the words of the prophets, which are read every sabbath-day, <transChange>in</transChange> condemning <transChange>Him.</transChange>
Acts 13:28 And though they found <transChange>in Him</transChange> no capital offence, yet they desired <transChange>of</transChange> Pilate that He might be put to death.
Acts 13:29 And when they had finished all <transChange>things that were</transChange> written concerning Him, they took <transChange>Him</transChange> down from the cross and laid <transChange>Him</transChange> in a tomb.
Acts 13:30 But God raised Him from the dead:
Acts 13:31 and He was seen for many days by those that came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
Acts 13:32 And we bring you good tidings,
Acts 13:33 that the promise made unto the fathers God hath fulfilled unto us their children, having raised up Jesus again: as it is also written in the second psalm, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
Acts 13:34 And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to <transChange>the place of</transChange> corruption, He hath said thus, "I will give you the sure mercies of David."
Acts 13:35 Wherefore he saith also in another <transChange>place,</transChange> Thou wilt not suffer thine holy <transChange>One</transChange> to see corruption.
Acts 13:36 Now David having served his own generation according to the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption: but He whom God raised,
Acts 13:37 did not see corruption.
Acts 13:38 Be it known therefore unto you, brethren, that through Him is preached unto you the remission of sins:
Acts 13:39 and by Him every one that believeth is justified from all <transChange>things,</transChange> from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
Acts 13:40 Beware therefore, least what is spoken in the prophets come upon you,
Acts 13:41 "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish; for I do a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though any <transChange>one</transChange> should declare it unto you."
Acts 13:42 As they went out of the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles desired that these words might be spoken to them on the following sabbath.
Acts 13:43 And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who addressing themselves to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
Acts 13:44 And on the next sabbath almost all the city came together to hear the word of God.
Acts 13:45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, opposing and reviling <transChange>him.</transChange>
Acts 13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas boldly said, It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you; but since ye reject it, and judge not yourselves worthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles:
Acts 13:47 for so the Lord hath commanded us, <transChange>saying,</transChange> "I have appointed thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the utmost <transChange>part</transChange> of the earth."
Acts 13:48 And when the Gentiles heard <transChange>this,</transChange> they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were determined for eternal life believed.
Acts 13:49 And the word of the Lord was spread through the whole country:
Acts 13:50 but the Jews stirred up devout and honorable women, and the heads of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territories.
Acts 13:51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
Acts 13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the holy Spirit. <chapter eID="gen4325" osisID="Acts.13"/>
Acts 14:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.14" sID="gen4378"/>
Acts 14:1 And at Iconium they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great number both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.
Acts 14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and inflamed the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
Acts 14:3 They therefore stayed a considerable time speaking freely of the Lord, who bare witness to the word of his grace, and gave signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
Acts 14:4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and some were for the Jews, and some for the apostles:
Acts 14:5 but when there was an effort both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, together with their rulers, to offer violence <transChange>to them,</transChange> and to stone them;
Acts 14:6 being apprised <transChange>of it</transChange> they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the adjacent country:
Acts 14:7 and there they preached the gospel.
Acts 14:8 And there was sitting at Lystra, a man disabled in his feet, who had never walked <transChange>at all,</transChange> being lame from his birth.
Acts 14:9 This <transChange>man</transChange> heard Paul speaking; who looking earnestly at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
Acts 14:10 said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up, and walked.
Acts 14:11 And the people, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voice, saying in the Lycaonian tongue, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
Acts 14:12 And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury; because he was the chief speaker.
Acts 14:13 And the priest of Jupiter, who<transChange>se image</transChange> was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and with the people would have offered sacrifices <transChange>to them.</transChange>
Acts 14:14 But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, when they heard <transChange>of it,</transChange> rent their clothes, and ran in among the people,
Acts 14:15 crying out, and saying, "Sirs, why do ye these <transChange>things?</transChange> we also are men subject to the like infirmities with you, and we preach the gospel unto you, that ye may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea,
Acts 14:16 and all <transChange>things</transChange> therein, who in generations past suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways: though He left not Himself without witness;
Acts 14:17 for He did <transChange>us</transChange> good, <transChange>in</transChange> giving us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
Acts 14:18 And saying these <transChange>things,</transChange> they with difficulty restrained the people from sacrificing to them.
Acts 14:19 But there came thither <transChange>some</transChange> Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and persuading the multitude, stoned Paul, and dragged <transChange>him</transChange> out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
Acts 14:20 But when the disciples were gathered round him, he rose up and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
Acts 14:21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch;
Acts 14:22 confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting <transChange>them</transChange> to continue in the faith, and <transChange>telling them</transChange> that through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God.
Acts 14:23 And when they had appointed them elders in every church, praying and fasting, they recommended them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.
Acts 14:24 And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
Acts 14:25 And when they had preached the word at Perga, they went down to Attalia.
Acts 14:26 And from thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for the work which they had <transChange>now</transChange> fulfilled.
Acts 14:27 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they related what God had done by them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
Acts 14:28 And they spent a considerable time there with the disciples. <chapter eID="gen4378" osisID="Acts.14"/>
Acts 15:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.15" sID="gen4407"/>
Acts 15:1 Now some that came down from Judea, taught the brethren, <transChange>saying,</transChange> Except ye be circumcised according to the law of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
Acts 15:2 A dissension therefore arising, and Paul and Barnabas having no small dispute with them, it was resolved that Paul and Barnabas, and some others, should go up to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem about this question.
Acts 15:3 They therefore, being brought forward on their way by the church, passed through Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles: and they gave great joy to all the brethren.
Acts 15:4 And when they came to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and <transChange>by</transChange> the apostles and elders, and they told them all that God had done by them.
Acts 15:5 But there rose up, <transChange>said they,</transChange> some of the sect of the pharisees that believed, saying, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and enjoin <transChange>them</transChange> to keep the law of Moses.
Acts 15:6 So the apostles and elders were assembled together to consider about this matter.
Acts 15:7 And after much debate, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago, God, <transChange>who was</transChange> among us, chose that the Gentiles should hear by my mouth the word of the gospel, and believe.
Acts 15:8 And God who knoweth the heart, bare witness to them, giving them the holy Spirit, as <transChange>He had done</transChange> also to us:
Acts 15:9 and made no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.
Acts 15:10 Now therefore why do ye tempt God, <transChange>in</transChange> imposing a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
Acts 15:11 But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, in like manner as they.
Acts 15:12 And all the multitude kept silence, and gave attention to Barnabas and Paul, relating what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
Acts 15:13 And after they had done speaking, James rose up and said, Brethren, hearken unto me.
Acts 15:14 ---Simeon hath related, how God at first condescended to take out of the Gentiles a people to his name.
Acts 15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets,
Acts 15:16 as it is written, "After this will I return, and rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will repair its ruins, and set it up again.
Acts 15:17 That the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the nations, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord who doth all these <transChange>things.</transChange>"
Acts 15:18 <transChange>Now</transChange> all his works are known unto God from the beginning of the world:
Acts 15:19 wherefore my advice is, not to trouble those who from among the Gentiles are converted to God; but to write to them,
Acts 15:20 that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and <transChange>from</transChange> fornication, and <transChange>from what is</transChange> strangled, and <transChange>from</transChange> blood.
Acts 15:21 For Moses hath <transChange>had</transChange> from ancient times those that preach him in every city, and is <transChange>still</transChange> read in the synagogues every sabbath-<transChange>day.</transChange>
Acts 15:22 Then it seemed good to the apostles, and elders, and the whole church, to send men chose from among themselves to Antioch <transChange>along</transChange> with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas sirnamed Barsabas, and Silas; leading men among the brethren:
Acts 15:23 and they wrote by their hand, as follows, The apostles and elders and brethren <transChange>here</transChange> to the Gentile brethren <transChange>which are</transChange> in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, send greeting.
Acts 15:24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that some who went out from us, have troubled you by <transChange>their</transChange> discourses, unsettling your minds, saying, <transChange>ye must</transChange> be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no <transChange>such</transChange> commission;
Acts 15:25 it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved <transChange>brethren</transChange> Barnabas and Paul,
Acts 15:26 who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts 15:27 We have therefore sent <transChange>with them</transChange> Judas and Silas, to tell <transChange>you</transChange> the same things also by word <transChange>of mouth.</transChange>
Acts 15:28 For it seemed good to the holy Spirit, and <transChange>so</transChange> to us, to lay no more burthen upon you than these necessary <transChange>things.</transChange>
Acts 15:29 That ye abstain from <transChange>meats</transChange> offered to idols, and from blood, and from <transChange>what has been</transChange> strangled, and from fornication: from which ye will do well to keep yourselves. Farewel.
Acts 15:30 Being thus dispatched they came to Antioch, and when they had assembled the brethren, they delivered the epistle.
Acts 15:31 And when they had read <transChange>it,</transChange> they rejoiced at the consolation <transChange>it brought.</transChange>
Acts 15:32 And Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves, exhorted and established: the brethren by many discourses.
Acts 15:33 And after <transChange>some</transChange> time, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the apostles.
Acts 15:34 But it seemed good to Silas to continue there: Paul also and Barnabas stayed at Antioch,
Acts 15:35 teaching and preaching, with many others likewise, the word of the Lord.
Acts 15:36 And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit our brethren in every city, where we have preached the word of the Lord, <transChange>and see</transChange> how they are.
Acts 15:37 And Barnabas proposed to take with <transChange>them</transChange> John, <transChange>who was</transChange> surnamed Mark.
Acts 15:38 But Paul did not think proper to take him with <transChange>them,</transChange> who left them in Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
Acts 15:39 And there was a sharp dispute, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus: but Paul chose Silas and departed,
Acts 15:40 being recommended to the grace of God.
Acts 15:41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the churches. <chapter eID="gen4407" osisID="Acts.15"/>
Acts 16:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.16" sID="gen4449"/>
Acts 16:1 Then he came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold there was a certain disciple there, named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but of a Grecian father.
Acts 16:2 Who was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium:
Acts 16:3 <transChange>wherefore</transChange> Paul was desirous that he should go forth with him, and took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts 16:4 And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been made by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.
Acts 16:5 And so the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
Acts 16:6 And when they had passed through Phrygia and Galatia, being forbidden by the holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, they came to Mysia, and endeavoured to go to Bithynia:
Acts 16:7 but the Spirit suffered them not.
Acts 16:8 So they passed by Mysia, and came down to Troas.
Acts 16:9 And Paul saw a vision in the night, There stood a certain man of Macedonia, intreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.
Acts 16:10 And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to depart into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord called us to preach the gospel to them.
Acts 16:11 Therefore we set sail from Troas, and came in a direct course to Samothracia, and the <transChange>day</transChange> following to Neapolis;
Acts 16:12 and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of <transChange>that</transChange> part of Macedonia, <transChange>and</transChange> a <transChange>Roman</transChange> colony. And we staid some time in this city.
Acts 16:13 And on the sabbath-day we went out of the city to a river-side, where there used to be prayer: and we sat down and preached to the women that resorted <transChange>thither.</transChange>
Acts 16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a purple-seller of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard <transChange>us:</transChange> whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things that were spoken by Paul.
Acts 16:15 And when she was baptized and her family, she requested <transChange>us,</transChange> saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and lodge <transChange>there.</transChange> And she constrained us.
Acts 16:16 Now as we were going to <transChange>the place of</transChange> prayer, there met us a young woman that had a spirit of divination, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
Acts 16:17 She following Paul and us, cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who shew us the way of salvation.
Acts 16:18 And this she did for many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
Acts 16:19 And he came out that instant. And when her masters saw, that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the court to the magistrates.
Acts 16:20 And when they brought them to the governors, they said, These men cause great disturbance in our city, for they are Jews, and teach customs,
Acts 16:21 which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor practise, who are Romans.
Acts 16:22 And the populace rose up together against them: and the officers stripped off their clothes, and ordered them to be scourged.
Acts 16:23 And when they had given them many stripes, they cast <transChange>them</transChange> into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely.
Acts 16:24 Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
Acts 16:25 Now in the middle of the night Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, and the prisoners heard them.
Acts 16:26 And on a sudden there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bonds were loosed.
Acts 16:27 The jailor waking, and seeing the prison-doors open, drew his sword and was going to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners were fled.
Acts 16:28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
Acts 16:29 Then he called for lights, and sprang in, and being in a tremor fell down before Paul and Silas:
Acts 16:30 and bringing them out, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Acts 16:31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thine house.
Acts 16:32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all in his family.
Acts 16:33 And he took them at that <transChange>very</transChange> time of the night, and bathed their stripes: and was baptized, he and all his immediately <transChange>after.</transChange>
Acts 16:34 And he brought them into his house, and spread a table <transChange>for them,</transChange> and rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.
Acts 16:35 And when it was the day the governors sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
Acts 16:36 And the jailor told these words to Paul, <transChange>saying,</transChange> the governors have sent <transChange>orders,</transChange> that you should be discharged; now therefore depart, and go in peace.
Acts 16:37 But Paul said unto them, They have publicly beaten us, uncondemned, <transChange>and</transChange> Romans, and cast us into prison, and do they now turn us out privately? No verily, let them come themselves and fetch us out.
Acts 16:38 And the serjeants reported these words to the governors: and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
Acts 16:39 And they came and intreated them, and when they had brought them out, they desired them to leave the city.
Acts 16:40 And when they were come out of the prison, they went into <transChange>the house of</transChange> Lydia: and seeing the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. <chapter eID="gen4449" osisID="Acts.16"/>
Acts 17:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.17" sID="gen4490"/>
Acts 17:1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts 17:2 And according to <transChange>his</transChange> custom Paul went in among them, and for three sabbath-<transChange>days</transChange> discoursed to them from the scriptures;
Acts 17:3 opening <transChange>them</transChange> and shewing, that the Messiah was to suffer and rise again from the dead: and that this is the Christ <transChange>even,</transChange> Jesus, whom, <transChange>said he,</transChange> I preach unto you.
Acts 17:4 And some of them believed and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and a great number of the devout Greeks, and of the women of distinction not <transChange>a</transChange> few.
Acts 17:5 But the unbelieving Jews being filled with envy, collected some loose profligate fellows, and making a tumult set <transChange>all</transChange> the city in an uproar: and assaulting Jason's house, they sought for them <transChange>in order</transChange> to bring them out to the populace.
Acts 17:6 But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some <transChange>of the</transChange> brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, these <transChange>men</transChange> that have turned the world upside down,
Acts 17:7 are come hither also, and Jason has privately received them. And they all act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, there is another king, <transChange>one</transChange> Jesus.
Acts 17:8 And they alarmed the people, and the rulers of the city <transChange>upon</transChange> hearing these <transChange>things:</transChange>
Acts 17:9 but they taking security of Jason and the rest, let them go.
Acts 17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who, when they were come <transChange>thither,</transChange> went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts 17:11 These were more ingenuous than those at Thessalonica; for they received the word with all readiness of mind, searching the scriptures daily, whether these <transChange>things</transChange> were so.
Acts 17:12 And therefore many of them believed: and of the Grecian women of quality, and of men <transChange>likewise</transChange> not <transChange>a</transChange> few.
Acts 17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, to stir up the people.
Acts 17:14 Then the brethren immediately sent away Paul towards the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.
Acts 17:15 And they that conducted Paul attended him to Athens: and receiving an order to Silas and Timothy, to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
Acts 17:16 Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his Spirit was greatly moved, when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry.
Acts 17:17 He therefore disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and <transChange>other</transChange> devout persons <transChange>on the sabbath-day,</transChange> and with whomsoever he met in public every day.
Acts 17:18 But some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him; and some said, What would this babler say? and others, He seemeth to be a proclaimer of foreign deities: because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts 17:19 And they took and brought him to the Areopagus, and said, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest?
Acts 17:20 For thou bringest strange <transChange>things</transChange> to our ears; we would therefore know what these <transChange>things</transChange> mean.
Acts 17:21 (Now all the Athenians, and strangers sojourning <transChange>among them,</transChange> spent their time in nothing else, but to tell or to hear something new.)
Acts 17:22 Then Paul stood up in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that you are indeed over-much religious:
Acts 17:23 for as I was passing along, and looking at what ye worshipped, I found an altar on which there was inscribed, "To the unknown God." Whom therefore ye worship unknown, Him do I declare unto you.
Acts 17:24 The God that made the world and all things therein, being lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands:
Acts 17:25 nor is He served by the hands of men, <transChange>as</transChange> needing any <transChange>thing:</transChange> for He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
Acts 17:26 and hath made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined the seasons before-appointed <transChange>them,</transChange> and the bounds of their habitation;
Acts 17:27 that they might seek the Lord, if possibly they might trace Him, and find <transChange>Him:</transChange> though indeed He is not far from every one of us.
Acts 17:28 For in Him we live and move, and exist; as some also of your own poets have said, "For we his offspring are."
Acts 17:29 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to imagine that the Deity is like to gold, or silver, or stone, carved by the art and device of man.
Acts 17:30 Wherefore though God overlooked the times of <transChange>this</transChange> ignorance, He now requireth all men every where to repent.
Acts 17:31 Because He hath fixed a day, in which He will judge the world in righteousness, by <transChange>that</transChange> man whom He hath appointed <transChange>thereto;</transChange> having given assurance <transChange>of it</transChange> to all <transChange>men, by</transChange> raising Him from the dead.
Acts 17:32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some laughed at <transChange>it:</transChange> and others said, We will hear thee again concerning this <transChange>matter.</transChange>
Acts 17:33 So Paul went out of the assembly.
Acts 17:34 Some however adhered to him, and believed: among whom <transChange>was</transChange> Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. <chapter eID="gen4490" osisID="Acts.17"/>
Acts 18:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.18" sID="gen4525"/>
Acts 18:1 After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
Acts 18:2 And finding <transChange>there</transChange> a certain Jew, named Aquila, a native of Pontus, <transChange>who was</transChange> lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, (because Claudius <transChange>Cesar</transChange> had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome,) he went to them;
Acts 18:3 and as he was of the same trade, he staid and worked with them: for they were tent-makers.
Acts 18:4 And he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath-<transChange>day,</transChange> and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
Acts 18:5 And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was <transChange>very</transChange> urgent in spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus <transChange>was</transChange> the Messiah.
Acts 18:6 But as they opposed and blasphemed, he shook his garment, and said unto them, Your blood <transChange>be</transChange> upon your own heads; I am clear <transChange>of it:</transChange> from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.
Acts 18:7 And departing thence, he went to the house of one named Justus, who worshipped God, whose house was contiguous to the synagogue.
Acts 18:8 But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house: and many of the Corinthians hearing <transChange>the word</transChange> believed, and were baptized.
Acts 18:9 And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Fear not, but speak: and be not silent:</q>
Acts 18:10 <q marker="" who="Jesus">for I am with thee, and no man shall lay <transChange>hands</transChange> on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city."</q>
Acts 18:11 And he staid a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.
Acts 18:12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose against Paul, and brought him to the seat of justice,
Acts 18:13 saying, this <transChange>fellow</transChange> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
Acts 18:14 And when Paul was going to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were indeed an act of injustice, or <transChange>some</transChange> wicked crime, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you.
Acts 18:15 But if it be a question about words, and names, and your law, settle <transChange>it</transChange> yourselves; for I will be no judge of these <transChange>matters.</transChange>
Acts 18:16 And he ordered them away from the tribunal.
Acts 18:17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him <transChange>even</transChange> before the tribunal: but Gallio did not concern himself about the matter.
Acts 18:18 And after Paul had staid <transChange>there</transChange> yet a considerable time, he took leave of the brethren, and sailed from thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, after he had shaved his head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow.
Acts 18:19 And he came to Esphesus, and left them there: but <transChange>before his departure</transChange> he himself went into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
Acts 18:20 Though when they desired him to stay longer with them, he did not consent: but took his leave of them,
Acts 18:21 saying, I must by all means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing. So he sailed from Ephesus;
Acts 18:22 and landing at Cesarea, went up <transChange>to Jerusalem,</transChange> and after he had saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
Acts 18:23 And when he had spent some time <transChange>there,</transChange> he departed, and went in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples.
Acts 18:24 Now there came to Ephesus a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, <transChange>and</transChange> mighty in the scriptures.
Acts 18:25 Who had been instructed in the way of our Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught clearly the things of the Lord, though he knew only the baptism of John.
Acts 18:26 And as he began to speak openly in the synagogue, Aquila and Priscilla heard him and took him home, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.
Acts 18:27 And as he was inclined to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples exhorting <transChange>them</transChange> to receive him: who when he arrived, was very helpful to those who had believed through grace.
Acts 18:28 For he disputed vehemently with the Jews in public, proving by the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ. <chapter eID="gen4525" osisID="Acts.18"/>
Acts 19:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.19" sID="gen4554"/>
Acts 19:1 Now it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul having passed through the upper parts <transChange>of Asia</transChange> came to Ephesus:
Acts 19:2 and finding some disciples <transChange>there,</transChange> he said unto them, Have ye received the holy Spirit since ye embraced the faith? And they said unto him, Nay, we had not even heard whether the holy Spirit be <transChange>yet given.</transChange>
Acts 19:3 And he said unto them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into the baptism of John.
Acts 19:4 Then said Paul, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people, that they should believe in Him that was coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.
Acts 19:5 And when they heard <transChange>this,</transChange> they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts 19:6 And as Paul laid <transChange>his</transChange> hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And the men were <transChange>in</transChange> all about twelve.
Acts 19:7 And he went into the synagogue,
Acts 19:8 and spake boldly, disputing <transChange>with them</transChange> for <transChange>the space of</transChange> three months, and persuading <transChange>them of</transChange> the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts 19:9 But as some were hardened and refractory, speaking evil of the way <transChange>of life</transChange> before the multitude, he departed from them, and took away the disciples <transChange>with him,</transChange> disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
Acts 19:10 And this he did for two years; so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord Jesus.
Acts 19:11 And God wrought extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:
Acts 19:12 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases lest them, and evil spirits went out of them.
Acts 19:13 Then some of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those that had evil spirits, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth."
Acts 19:14 Now there were seven sons of <transChange>one</transChange> Sceva a Jewish priest, who did this.
Acts 19:15 But the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?
Acts 19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leapt upon them, and mastered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts 19:17 And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Acts 19:18 And many of them that believed came confessing and declaring their <transChange>former</transChange> practices.
Acts 19:19 And a great number of those that had used inquisitive arts, brought the books, and burned <transChange>them</transChange> before <transChange>them</transChange> all: and they computed the price of them, and found <transChange>it to be</transChange> fifty thousand <transChange>pieces</transChange> of silver.
Acts 19:20 So mightily did the word of the Lord increase and prevail.
Acts 19:21 After these things, Paul purposed in spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia, and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
Acts 19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of those that ministred to him, Timothy and Erastus, <transChange>but he</transChange> himself stayed <transChange>some</transChange> time in Asia.
Acts 19:23 Now there happened at that time no small disturbance about the way <transChange>which he taught.</transChange>
Acts 19:24 For one Demetrius, a silver-smith, who made silver models of Diana's temple, brought no small gain to the artificers: whom he got together,
Acts 19:25 and <transChange>with them</transChange> the workmen <transChange>they employed</transChange> about such things, and said, My friends, ye know that by this employment we get our wealth.
Acts 19:26 And ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but in almost all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and perverted many people, saying, that they are no gods which are made by hands.
Acts 19:27 So that we are not only in danger of this, that the business <transChange>we follow</transChange> will come to nothing; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised; and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the <transChange>whole</transChange> world worshippeth.
Acts 19:28 Hearing <transChange>this</transChange> and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great <transChange>is</transChange> Diana of the Ephesians.
Acts 19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, dragging with <transChange>them</transChange> Gaius and Aristarchus <transChange>two</transChange> Macedonians, fellow-travellers with Paul.
Acts 19:30 And when Paul would have gone in unto the people, the disciples would not let him.
Acts 19:31 And some also of the chief <transChange>men</transChange> of Asia, being his friends, sent to him and desired him not to venture himself into the theatre.
Acts 19:32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.
Acts 19:33 And they brought Alexander forward out of the multitude, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander beckoning <transChange>with</transChange> the hand, would have made a defence to the people.
Acts 19:34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice, for near two hours, Great <transChange>is</transChange> Diana of the Ephesians.
Acts 19:35 And when the Secretary had appeased the multitude, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is devoted to the service of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
Acts 19:36 Since therefore these things are incontestible, ye ought to be quiet <transChange>and composed,</transChange> and to do nothing rashly.
Acts 19:37 For ye have brought these men <transChange>hither,</transChange> who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.
Acts 19:38 If Demetrius therefore, and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any <transChange>one,</transChange> the law-courts are open, and there are <transChange>Roman</transChange> proconsuls <transChange>likewise:</transChange> let them implead one another.
Acts 19:39 But if ye are enquiring any thing about other matters, let it be decided in a lawful assembly:
Acts 19:40 for we are in danger of being charged with sedition for <transChange>what has happened</transChange> this day, there being no cause by which we can give a reason for this concourse.
Acts 19:41 And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly. <chapter eID="gen4554" osisID="Acts.19"/>
Acts 20:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.20" sID="gen4596"/>
Acts 20:1 And after the tumult was over, Paul sent for the disciples to <transChange>him,</transChange> and having embraced them, departed to go into Macedonia.
Acts 20:2 And having passed through those parts, and given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.
Acts 20:3 And when he had spent three months <transChange>there,</transChange> the Jews having laid wait for him as he was going to embark for Syria, he determined to return by Macedonia.
Acts 20:4 And there accompanied him to Asia, Sopater the Berean, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy: and the Asiatics,
Acts 20:5 Tychicus and Trophimus, who went before and stayed for us at Troas.
Acts 20:6 And after the days of unleavened bread we sailed from Philippi, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.
Acts 20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples were assembled together to break bread, Paul being about to depart on the morrow, preached unto them, and continued his discourse till midnight.
Acts 20:8 And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.
Acts 20:9 And a young man named Eutychus, who sat in a window, falling into a deep sleep, as Paul was discoursing for a long time, sunk down and fell from the third story, and was taken up dead.
Acts 20:10 And Paul went down and leaned over him, and took him up and said, Be not disturbed; for his life is in him.
Acts 20:11 Then he went up again, and having broken bread and eaten, and conversed <transChange>with them</transChange> a considerable time, <transChange>even</transChange> till break of day, he departed.
Acts 20:12 And they brought <transChange>in</transChange> the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
Acts 20:13 But we went before to the ship, and sailed to Assos, being there to take in Paul: for so he had appointed, designing himself to go on foot.
Acts 20:14 And as soon as he joined us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.
Acts 20:15 And sailing from thence we came the next <transChange>day</transChange> over against Chios; and the <transChange>day</transChange> following we arrived at Samos, and stopping at Trogyllium, we came the <transChange>day</transChange> after to Miletus.
Acts 20:16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend time in Asia: for he endeavoured, if it were possible, to be at Jerusalem <transChange>on</transChange> the day of Pentecost.
Acts 20:17 But he sent from Miletus to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
Acts 20:18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know in what manner I behaved among you all the time, from the first day that I came into Asia.
Acts 20:19 Serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and trials which befel me by the ambushes of the Jews.
Acts 20:20 <transChange>And</transChange> how I with-held nothing <transChange>that was</transChange> useful, but have declared <transChange>it</transChange> to you, and have taught you publicly and from house to house:
Acts 20:21 testifying both to the Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts 20:22 And now, being constrained by the spirit, behold I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will befal me there:
Acts 20:23 save that the holy Spirit testifieth in every city, that bonds and afflictions await me.
Acts 20:24 But none of these things move me, nor do I account my life dear, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
Acts 20:25 And now behold I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
Acts 20:26 Wherefore I call you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all <transChange>men.</transChange>
Acts 20:27 For I have not failed to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
Acts 20:28 Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the holy Spirit hath appointed you bishops, to feed the church of God, which He purchased with his own blood.
Acts 20:29 For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
Acts 20:30 And from among yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse <transChange>things</transChange> to draw away disciples after them.
Acts 20:31 Watch therefore, remembering that for the space of three years I ceased not <transChange>by</transChange> night and <transChange>by</transChange> day to warn every one with tears.
Acts 20:32 And now, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his grace: who is able to edify <transChange>you,</transChange> and to give you an inheritance among all that are sanctified.
Acts 20:33 I have coveted no one's silver, or gold, or apparel:
Acts 20:34 and ye yourselves know that these hands have ministred to my necessities, and to those that were with me.
Acts 20:35 I have shewed you <transChange>in</transChange> all <transChange>things,</transChange> that <transChange>by</transChange> labouring thus ye ought to support the infirm; and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, who said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">It is more blessed to give than to receive.</q>
Acts 20:36 And when he had said these <transChange>things,</transChange> he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
Acts 20:37 And they were all much grieved, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him: sorrowing most <transChange>of all</transChange> at the word which he spake,
Acts 20:38 that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship. <chapter eID="gen4596" osisID="Acts.20"/>
Acts 21:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.21" sID="gen4635"/>
Acts 21:1 Now as soon as we had parted from them, and set sail, we came in a strait course to Coos, and the <transChange>day</transChange> following to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.
Acts 21:2 And finding a ship <transChange>there, which was</transChange> passing over to Phenicia, we went aboard <transChange>it,</transChange> and set sail.
Acts 21:3 And coming in fight of Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed to Syria, and came down to Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade.
Acts 21:4 And we stayed there seven days; having met with <transChange>some</transChange> disciples: who told Paul by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts 21:5 But when we had completed <transChange>these</transChange> days, we departed and went our way, all <transChange>of them</transChange> attending us with <transChange>their</transChange> wives and children, till <transChange>we were</transChange> out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed.
Acts 21:6 And having taken leave of each other, we went into the ship, and they returned home.
Acts 21:7 And we finishing our voyage, came down from Tyre to Ptolemais, and saluting the brethren stayed with them one day.
Acts 21:8 On the morrow Paul and those that were with him departed <transChange>from Ptolemais,</transChange> and came to Cesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was <transChange>one</transChange> of the seven <transChange>deacons,</transChange> we stayed with him.
Acts 21:9 And he had four daughters virgins, <transChange>that were</transChange> prophetesses.
Acts 21:10 And as we abode <transChange>there</transChange> several days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet named Agabus:
Acts 21:11 and he came to us, and taking up Paul's girdle, and binding his own hands and feet, he said, Thus saith the holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Acts 21:12 And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place intreated him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts 21:13 But Paul answered, What do ye <transChange>mean,</transChange> weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts 21:14 And as he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Acts 21:15 And after these days <transChange>were expired,</transChange> we packed up our things, and went to Jerusalem.
Acts 21:16 And there went also with us from Cesarea <transChange>some</transChange> of the disciples, who brought us to one Mnason a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge.
Acts 21:17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us with joy.
Acts 21:18 And the next day Paul went in with us to James: and all the elders were present.
Acts 21:19 And when he had saluted them, he gave a particular narrative of the things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
Acts 21:20 And when they heard <transChange>it,</transChange> they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the believing Jews, and they are all zealous for the law.
Acts 21:21 And they have heard of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews, who are among the Gentiles, to forsake <transChange>the law of</transChange> Moses, telling them not to circumcise <transChange>their</transChange> children, nor to walk after <transChange>our</transChange> customs.
Acts 21:22 What then is <transChange>to be done?</transChange> The people must necessarily meet together; for they will hear that thou art come.
Acts 21:23 Do this therefore, which we advise thee. <transChange>Here</transChange> are four men with us, that have a vow upon them: take these and be purified with them,
Acts 21:24 and join in their expences, that they may shave their head: and <transChange>that</transChange> all may know, that there is nothing in what they have heard of thee; but thou thyself walkest according to the law.
Acts 21:25 But as to the believing Gentiles, we have written and determined, that they <transChange>need</transChange> observe no such thing; only to keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from <transChange>any thing</transChange> strangled, and from fornication.
Acts 21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day being purified with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification till an offering should be offered for every one of them.
Acts 21:27 But when the seven days were near ended, the Jews <transChange>that came</transChange> from Asia seeing him in the temple, raised a tumult among the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help:
Acts 21:28 this is the man that teaches all <transChange>men</transChange> every where against the people <transChange>of the Jews,</transChange> and the law, and this <transChange>sacred</transChange> place? and besides, hath brought Greeks too into the temple, and polluted this holy place.
Acts 21:29 (For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they thought Paul had brought into the temple.)
Acts 21:30 And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people: and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the gates were shut.
Acts 21:31 And as they were going to kill him, a report came to the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar:
Acts 21:32 who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the chiliarch and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.
Acts 21:33 Then the commanding officer came near and took him, and ordered <transChange>him</transChange> to be bound with two chains; and inquired, who he was, and what he had done.
Acts 21:34 But some in the croud bawled out one thing and some another: and as he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
Acts 21:35 And when he was upon the stairs, he was <transChange>even</transChange> borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.
Acts 21:36 For the multitude followed crying out, Away with him.
Acts 21:37 And as Paul was going to be led into the castle, he said to the tribune, May I be allowed to speak <transChange>a word</transChange> to thee? And he said, Canst thou speak Greek?
Acts 21:38 Art not thou that Egyptian, who before this madest a sedition, and didst lead out into the wilderness four thousand murtherers?
Acts 21:39 But Paul said, I am indeed a Jew, a man of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beg thou wouldest permit me to speak to the people.
Acts 21:40 And when he gave him leave, Paul standing on the stairs made a sign with the hand to the people: and there being a great silence made, He spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, <chapter eID="gen4635" osisID="Acts.21"/>
Acts 22:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.22" sID="gen4676"/>
Acts 22:1 Brethren, and Fathers, hear now my apology to you,
Acts 22:2 ---(and when they heard that he spake to them in the Hebrew dialect, they the more <transChange>readily</transChange> kept silence, and he said,)
Acts 22:3 ---I am indeed a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, accurately instructed in the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as ye all are this day.
Acts 22:4 And I persecuted <transChange>those of</transChange> this persuasion even unto death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
Acts 22:5 As the high priest is my witness, and all the elders: from whom I received letters to <transChange>our</transChange> brethren, and went to Damascus to bring those also, that were there, bound to Jerusalem, to be punished.
Acts 22:6 And it came to pass that as I was on my journey and drew nigh to Damascus, about mid-day, on a sudden a great light from heaven shone round about me:
Acts 22:7 and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</q>
Acts 22:8 And I answered, Who art <transChange>thou,</transChange> Lord? And He said unto me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</q>
Acts 22:9 And they that were with me saw the light indeed, and were affrighted; but they did not hear the voice of Him that spake to me.
Acts 22:10 And I said, Lord, what shall I do? And the Lord said unto me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Arise, and go <transChange>on</transChange> to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which are appointed for thee to do.</q>
Acts 22:11 And as I could not see by reason of the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those that were with me, I came to Damascus.
Acts 22:12 And one Ananias, a devout observer of the law, who had a good character from all the Jews that dwelt <transChange>there,</transChange>
Acts 22:13 came to me, and stood by <transChange>me,</transChange> and said, Brother Saul, look up: and I immediately looked up upon him.
Acts 22:14 And he said, The God of our Fathers hath before appointed thee to know his will, and to see the just <transChange>One,</transChange> and to hear a voice from his mouth.
Acts 22:15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men, of what thou hast seen and heard.
Acts 22:16 And now why shouldst thou delay? Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.
Acts 22:17 And when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance.
Acts 22:18 And <transChange>I</transChange> saw Him saying unto me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</q>
Acts 22:19 And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and scourged in the synagogues them that believed on Thee.
Acts 22:20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also stood by and consented to his death, and kept the clothes of them that slew him.
Acts 22:21 But he said unto me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Go away; for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</q>---
Acts 22:22 And they heard him to this word, and <transChange>then</transChange> they exalted their voice, saying, Away with such <transChange>a fellow</transChange> from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live.
Acts 22:23 And as they were bawling out, and throwing <transChange>off</transChange> their clothes, and casting <transChange>up</transChange> dust into the air,
Acts 22:24 the tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and ordered him to be put to the question by scourging; that he might know for what reason they so cried out against him.
Acts 22:25 And as they were binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man <transChange>who is</transChange> a Roman, uncondemned?
Acts 22:26 And the centurion hearing <transChange>this,</transChange> went and told the tribune, saying, Consider what thou art about to do; for this man is a Roman.
Acts 22:27 Then the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yes.
Acts 22:28 And the tribune replied, I obtained this freedom with a large sum of money. And Paul said, But I was <transChange>free</transChange>-born.
Acts 22:29 Immediately therefore those who were going to put him to the question quitted him: and the tribune also was afraid, when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
Acts 22:30 And on the morrow, desiring to know for certain what he was accused of by the Jews, he loosed him from his bonds, and ordered the chief priests and all their council to attend; and he brought down Paul, and set him before them: <chapter eID="gen4676" osisID="Acts.22"/>
Acts 23:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.23" sID="gen4707"/>
Acts 23:1 and Paul looking earnestly at the sanhedrim, said, "Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God even to this day:"
Acts 23:2 but the high priest Ananias ordered those that stood next him, to smite him on the mouth.
Acts 23:3 Then said Paul to him, "God will smite thee, thou whited wall: dost thou sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law commandest me to be smitten?"
Acts 23:4 But they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high-priest?
Acts 23:5 And Paul said, I was not aware, brethren, that it was the high-priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
Acts 23:6 But Paul, knowing that the one part were sadducees, and the other pharisees, cried out in the sanhedrim, "Brethren, I am a pharisee, the son of a pharisee: for the hope of a resurrection of the dead I am <transChange>now</transChange> prosecuted."
Acts 23:7 Upon his saying this, there rose a contention between the pharisees and the sadducees; and the people were divided.
Acts 23:8 For the sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the pharisees acknowledge both.
Acts 23:9 So there was a great clamor: and the scribes <transChange>that were</transChange> of the party of the pharisees rose up and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
Acts 23:10 But as there arose much contention, the tribune fearing least Paul should be torn in pieces by them, ordered <transChange>a party of</transChange> soldiers to go down, and take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring him into the castle.
Acts 23:11 And the following night, the Lord standing by him said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Paul, be of good courage; for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou also bear testimony at Rome.</q>
Acts 23:12 And when it was day, some of the Jews, having formed a conspiracy, bound themselves with a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
Acts 23:13 And they were more than forty that had made this oath:
Acts 23:14 who came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves by a curse to eat nothing till we have killed Paul.
Acts 23:15 Now therefore do ye with <transChange>the rest of</transChange> the sanhedrim signify to the tribune, that he would bring him down to you to-morrow, as if you would examine more accurately some <transChange>things</transChange> concerning him: and we are ready to dispatch him before he come near <transChange>you.</transChange>"
Acts 23:16 But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
Acts 23:17 Then Paul called one of the centurions to <transChange>him,</transChange> and said, Introduce this young man to the tribune; for he hath something to tell him.
Acts 23:18 So he took him and brought him to the tribune, and said, Paul the prisoner called me to <transChange>him,</transChange> and desired me to introduce this young man unto thee, <transChange>as</transChange> having something to say to thee.
Acts 23:19 And the tribune took him by the hand, and retiring into a private <transChange>apartment</transChange> asked <transChange>him,</transChange> What is <transChange>it</transChange> which thou hast to tell me?
Acts 23:20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring down Paul to-morrow to the council, as if they would inquire something more strictly concerning him.
Acts 23:21 <transChange>But</transChange> do not thou comply with them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves with a curse neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and they are now ready, waiting for an order from thee.
Acts 23:22 Then the tribune dismissed the young man, charging <transChange>him,</transChange> Tell no one that thou hast discovered these <transChange>things</transChange> to me.
Acts 23:23 And he called two of the centurions to <transChange>him,</transChange> and said, Get ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night.
Acts 23:24 And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on and bring <transChange>him</transChange> safe to Felix the governor.
Acts 23:25 And he wrote a letter to this effect:
Acts 23:26 Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix <transChange>sendeth</transChange> greeting.
Acts 23:27 This man being seized by the Jews, and about to be killed by them, I came upon them with <transChange>some</transChange> soldiers and rescued him: for I understand that he is a Roman.
Acts 23:28 But desiring to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down into their council:
Acts 23:29 and I found he was accused about questions of their law, but had no charge <transChange>against him</transChange> deserving death or bonds.
Acts 23:30 But an ambush, <transChange>which was</transChange> going to be laid for the man by the Jews, being discovered to me, immediately I sent <transChange>him</transChange> to thee, telling his accusers also to say before thee what <transChange>they had</transChange> against him. Farewell.
Acts 23:31 The soldiers therefore, according to the orders given them, took up Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Acts 23:32 And the next day they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him;
Acts 23:33 who, when they came into Cesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
Acts 23:34 And when the governor had read <transChange>the letter,</transChange> and asked of what province he was; being informed that <transChange>he was</transChange> of Cilicia, he said,
Acts 23:35 I will hear thee, when thine accusers are also come. And he ordered him to be kept in Herod's palace. <chapter eID="gen4707" osisID="Acts.23"/>
Acts 24:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.24" sID="gen4743"/>
Acts 24:1 And after five days, the high-priest Ananias came down with the elders, and one Tertulius an orator, who appeared before the governor against Paul.
Acts 24:2 And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse <transChange>him,</transChange> saying, "As by thee we enjoy much peace, and glorious things are done to this nation by thy prudent administration,
Acts 24:3 we acknowledge <transChange>it</transChange> upon all occasions and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
Acts 24:4 But that I may not trespass upon thee too far, I beg thou wouldst hear us a few words with thy <transChange>wonted</transChange> goodness.
Acts 24:5 For having found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes,
Acts 24:6 and attempting to profane the temple, we apprehended him, and would have judged <transChange>him</transChange> according to our law.
Acts 24:7 But Lysias the tribune came upon us, and with great violence took <transChange>him</transChange> away out of our hands, commanding his accusers to come unto thee:
Acts 24:8 from whom thou mayst thyself <transChange>by</transChange> examining <transChange>him</transChange> come to the knowledge of all these <transChange>things</transChange> of which we accuse him."
Acts 24:9 And the Jews also assented, saying, that these <transChange>things</transChange> were so.
Acts 24:10 Then Paul, when the governor permitted him to speak, answered <transChange>in this manner,</transChange> "As I know that thou hast been many years a judge to this nation, I do the more chearfully answer for myself:
Acts 24:11 because thou mayst know, that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:
Acts 24:12 and they neither found me disputing with any one in the temple, or making sedition among the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
Acts 24:13 nor can they prove <transChange>the things</transChange> of which they now accuse me.
Acts 24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way, which they call heresy, so do I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things <transChange>which are</transChange> written in the law, and the prophets:
Acts 24:15 having hope in God, (which they themselves also expect) that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
Acts 24:16 And on this account do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence <transChange>both</transChange> towards God and <transChange>towards</transChange> men.
Acts 24:17 Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
Acts 24:18 Upon which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude nor with tumult:
Acts 24:19 who ought to have been here before thee, and make good their charge, if they had any thing against me.
Acts 24:20 Or let these themselves say, if they found any crime in me, when I stood before the sanhedrim;
Acts 24:21 unless for this one expression, that I cried out when I stood among them, For the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
Acts 24:22 And when Felix heard these <transChange>things</transChange> he put them off, (for he had been more particularly informed concerning this way <transChange>of religion,</transChange>) and said, When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will thoroughly examine your matters.
Acts 24:23 And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul <transChange>secure,</transChange> and to let him have <transChange>some</transChange> liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting him or coming to him.
Acts 24:24 Some days after Felix coming with his wife Drusilla, a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning faith in Christ.
Acts 24:25 And as he was reasoning of justice, temperance, and a future judgement, Felix trembled, and said, Go thy way for this time, and I will take a proper opportunity to call for thee <transChange>again.</transChange>
Acts 24:26 And hoping also that money would be given him by Paul, that he might discharge him; he sent for him the more frequently, and conversed with him.
Acts 24:27 But after two years Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; and being willing to gain favor with the Jews lest Paul confined. <chapter eID="gen4743" osisID="Acts.24"/>
Acts 25:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.25" sID="gen4771"/>
Acts 25:1 Festus therefore, being come into the province, after three days went up from Cesarea to Jerusalem.
Acts 25:2 And the high-priest and principal <transChange>men</transChange> among the Jews, appeared before him against Paul, and made application to him,
Acts 25:3 begging the favor of him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; <transChange>for they were</transChange> preparing an ambush to kill him by the way.
Acts 25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul was in custody at Cesarea, and that <transChange>he</transChange> himself should go <transChange>thither</transChange> soon.
Acts 25:5 Therefore, said he, let those of you who are able, go down with <transChange>me,</transChange> and if there be any thing <transChange>bad</transChange> in this man, let them accuse him.
Acts 25:6 And when he had staid among them more than ten days, he went down to Cesarea, and the next day sitting on the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought <transChange>before him.</transChange>
Acts 25:7 And when he was come, the Jews that came down from Jerusalem, stood <transChange>round</transChange> about, bringing many heavy charges against Paul, which they were not able to prove:
Acts 25:8 he answering in his <transChange>own</transChange> defence, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar have I committed any offence.
Acts 25:9 But Festus, being desirous to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there to be tried concerning these things before me?
Acts 25:10 Then said Paul, I stand at Cesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried: I have done no wrong to the Jews, as thou very well knowest.
Acts 25:11 For if I am indeed doing <transChange>them</transChange> wrong, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be nothing <transChange>in</transChange> what these <transChange>men</transChange> accuse me of, no one can give me up to them.
Acts 25:12 I appeal to Cesar. Then Festus, conferring with <transChange>his</transChange> council, answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? to Cesar thou shalt go.
Acts 25:13 And some days after king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea to salute Festus.
Acts 25:14 And as they spent several days there, Festus related Paul's <transChange>case</transChange> to the king, saying, There is a man left in custody by Felix: concerning whom,
Acts 25:15 when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews appeared <transChange>in court,</transChange> desiring judgement against him.
Acts 25:16 To whom I answered, it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have an opportunity of <transChange>making his</transChange> defence concerning the accusation.
Acts 25:17 Therefore when they were come hither, making no delay, I sat on the tribunal the next day, and ordered the man to be brought <transChange>before me.</transChange>
Acts 25:18 Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed <transChange>they would:</transChange>
Acts 25:19 but had certain questions against him concerning their own religion; and of one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Acts 25:20 But I being in doubt as to the dispute concerning these <transChange>matters,</transChange> asked <transChange>him,</transChange> if he would go to Jerusalem, and there be tried concerning these <transChange>things.</transChange>
Acts 25:21 But when Paul appealed, to be reserved to the hearing of <transChange>our</transChange> sovereign, I ordered him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.
Acts 25:22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, I should be willing to hear the man myself. And he said, thou shalt hear him to-morrow.
Acts 25:23 The next day therefore, Agrippa and Bernice coming with much pomp, and entering into the court, together with the chief officers, and men of <transChange>greatest</transChange> eminence in the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought <transChange>in.</transChange>
Acts 25:24 And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all that are here present with us, ye see this <transChange>man,</transChange> concerning whom all the Jews have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out, that he ought not to live.
Acts 25:25 But when I found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and as he himself has appealed to the emperor, I have determined to send him.
Acts 25:26 Concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to <transChange>our</transChange> sovereign: wherefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination <transChange>is</transChange> made I may have somewhat to write.
Acts 25:27 For it seems to me absurd, to send a prisoner and not to signify the crimes <transChange>laid</transChange> against him." <chapter eID="gen4771" osisID="Acts.25"/>
Acts 26:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.26" sID="gen4799"/>
Acts 26:1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth <transChange>his</transChange> hand, <transChange>thus</transChange> made his defence,
Acts 26:2 "O king Agrippa, I think myself happy, that I am this day to make my defence before thee, concerning all <transChange>the things</transChange> which I am accused of by the Jews:
Acts 26:3 especially as thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions <transChange>which are</transChange> among the Jews; wherefore I intreat thee to hear me patiently.
Acts 26:4 My manner of life then from <transChange>my</transChange> youth, as it has been from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews are acquainted with,
Acts 26:5 knowing me before, (if they would testify <transChange>it,</transChange>) that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a pharisee.
Acts 26:6 And now I stand arraigned for the hope of the promise <transChange>which was</transChange> made by God to our fathers:
Acts 26:7 to which <transChange>promise</transChange> our twelve tribes, worshipping continually night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, O king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
Acts 26:8 What! is it judged incredible by you, that God <transChange>should</transChange> raise the dead?
Acts 26:9 I indeed <transChange>once</transChange> thought with myself, that I ought to do many <transChange>things</transChange> contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene:
Acts 26:10 which I also did in Jerusalem; and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority <transChange>for it</transChange> from the chief priests; and when they were put to death I gave my voice against <transChange>them.</transChange>
Acts 26:11 And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled <transChange>them</transChange> to blaspheme, and being excessively enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
Acts 26:12 On which <transChange>accounts</transChange> as I was going to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests---at mid-day,
Acts 26:13 O king, <transChange>as I was</transChange> on the way <transChange>thither</transChange> I saw a light from heaven exceeding the splendor of the sun, shining <transChange>round</transChange> about me and those that were going with me.
Acts 26:14 And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, <q marker="" who="Jesus">Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? <transChange>It is</transChange> hard for thee to kick against the goads.</q>
Acts 26:15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And He said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.</q>
Acts 26:16 <q marker="" who="Jesus">But rise, and stand on thy feet: for to this <transChange>end</transChange> have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou hast seen, and <transChange>of those for</transChange> which I shall <transChange>hereafter</transChange> appear unto thee:</q>
Acts 26:17 <q marker="" who="Jesus">delivering thee from the people and <transChange>from</transChange> the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee,</q>
Acts 26:18 <q marker="" who="Jesus">to open their eyes, <transChange>and</transChange> to turn <transChange>them</transChange> from darkness to light, and <transChange>from</transChange> the power of satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.</q>
Acts 26:19 Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:
Acts 26:20 but declared first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea, and <transChange>then</transChange> to the Gentiles, that they should repent, and turn unto God, performing works suitable to repentance.
Acts 26:21 For these <transChange>things</transChange> the Jews seized me in the temple, and attempted to kill me.
Acts 26:22 But having obtained help of God, I continue until this day, testifying both to small and great, <transChange>and</transChange> saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses declared should come to pass; <transChange>even</transChange> that the Messiah should suffer,
Acts 26:23 <transChange>and</transChange> being the first of the resurrection from the dead should bring light to the people and to the Gentiles."
Acts 26:24 And as he was saying these things in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning turns thy brain.
Acts 26:25 But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but <transChange>I</transChange> speak the words of truth and of a sound mind.
Acts 26:26 For the king knoweth of these <transChange>things,</transChange> to whom also I speak with freedom; because I am persuaded that none of them are unknown to him; for this was not done in a corner.
Acts 26:27 O king Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?
Acts 26:28 I know that thou believest <transChange>them.</transChange> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou almost persuadest me to be a Christian.
Acts 26:29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
Acts 26:30 And when he had said this, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those that sat with them.
Acts 26:31 And when they were retired, they spake to each other, saying, this man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
Acts 26:32 And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cesar. <chapter eID="gen4799" osisID="Acts.26"/>
Acts 27:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.27" sID="gen4832"/>
Acts 27:1 Now as it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan cohort.
Acts 27:2 And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, we went off, intending to sail by the coasts of Asia; Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us.
Acts 27:3 And the next <transChange>day</transChange> we touched at Sidon. And Julius treating Paul with <transChange>great</transChange> humanity, permitted him to go to his friends to get <transChange>proper</transChange> supplies.
Acts 27:4 And when we departed from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
Acts 27:5 And sailing through the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra <transChange>a city</transChange> of Lycia.
Acts 27:6 And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria bound for Italy, he put us on board it.
Acts 27:7 And as we sailed slowly for many days, and were hardly got on to Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete by Salmone.
Acts 27:8 And passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called the Fair-havens, near to which was the city <transChange>of</transChange> Lasea.
Acts 27:9 And as much time was spent, and sailing was now dangerous, (for the fast was now past,) Paul exhorted <transChange>them,</transChange>
Acts 27:10 saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage is like to be prejudicial and <transChange>with</transChange> much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives.
Acts 27:11 But the centurion regarded the pilot and the master of the vessel, more than the <transChange>things</transChange> that were said by Paul.
Acts 27:12 And the haven not being commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to sail from thence, if they could possibly reach to Phenice to winter <transChange>at that</transChange> haven of Crete, which looks <transChange>both</transChange> to the south-west and north-west.
Acts 27:13 And as the south wind blew gently, thinking they were secure of <transChange>their</transChange> purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed close by Crete.
Acts 27:14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called Euroclydon.
Acts 27:15 And the ship being hurried on, and not able to face the wind, we gave it up and <transChange>so</transChange> were carried <transChange>along.</transChange>
Acts 27:16 And running under a certain island called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat.
Acts 27:17 Which when they had hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing least they should fall into the quick-sands, they struck fail, and so were driven.
Acts 27:18 And as we were exceedingly tossed by the storm, the next <transChange>day</transChange> they lightened the ship:
Acts 27:19 and the third <transChange>day</transChange> we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship <transChange>too.</transChange>
Acts 27:20 And as neither sun nor stars appeared for several days, and no small tempest lay on <transChange>us,</transChange> all hope of our being saved was now taken away.
Acts 27:21 But after long abstinence from food, Paul stood <transChange>up</transChange> in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not loosed from Crete, and so have saved this damage and loss.
Acts 27:22 However, I now exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of <transChange>any</transChange> life among you, but only of the ship:
Acts 27:23 for there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying,
Acts 27:24 Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Cesar, and behold God hath given thee all <transChange>that are</transChange> sailing with thee.
Acts 27:25 Wherefore, Sirs, be of good courage; for I trust in God, that it shall be so, according as it was told me.
Acts 27:26 But we must be cast upon some island.
Acts 27:27 And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic sea, about the middle of the night the mariners thought they drew near to some land:
Acts 27:28 and sounding they found <transChange>it</transChange> twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, and sounded again, they found <transChange>it</transChange> fifteen fathoms.
Acts 27:29 Then fearing least they should fall upon <transChange>some</transChange> rocky places, they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for day.
Acts 27:30 But the mariners endeavouring to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea, under pretence that they were going to stretch out anchors from the head of the ship,
Acts 27:31 Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers, Unless these <transChange>men</transChange> stay in the ship ye cannot be saved.
Acts 27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
Acts 27:33 And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted <transChange>them</transChange> all to take <transChange>some</transChange> food, saying, Fourteen days this day ye continue waiting without <transChange>proper</transChange> food, having taken nothing:
Acts 27:34 wherefore I exhort you to take <transChange>some</transChange> nourishment, for this is <transChange>necessary</transChange> for your safety: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.
Acts 27:35 And having spoken thus, he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of <transChange>them</transChange> all, and when he had broken <transChange>it</transChange> he began to eat.
Acts 27:36 And being all encouraged they also took <transChange>some</transChange> food.
Acts 27:37 And we were <transChange>in</transChange> all in the ship two hundred <transChange>and</transChange> seventy-six souls.
Acts 27:38 And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship and cast out the corn into the sea.
Acts 27:39 And when it was day, they did not know the land <transChange>near them:</transChange> but they perceived a certain creek with a shore, into which they were desirous, if they could, to have thrust the ship.
Acts 27:40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they trusted <transChange>the ship</transChange> to the sea, at the same time, loosing the rudder-bands; and hoisting up the main-sail to the wind, they made to the shore.
Acts 27:41 But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship a-ground; and the fore-part stuck fast, and remained immoveable, but the hinder part was dashed in pieces by the violence of the waves.
Acts 27:42 And the counsel of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, least any <transChange>of them</transChange> should swim out and escape.
Acts 27:43 But the centurion, desirous to save Paul, hindered them from <transChange>their</transChange> purpose, and ordered those that could swim to throw <transChange>themselves</transChange> out first, and get off to land:
Acts 27:44 and the rest, some on planks, and others on some <transChange>other things</transChange> out of the ship. And so it came to pass that <transChange>they</transChange> all got safe to land. <chapter eID="gen4832" osisID="Acts.27"/>
Acts 28:0 <chapter osisID="Acts.28" sID="gen4877"/>
Acts 28:1 And when they were safe <transChange>on shore,</transChange> they understood, that the island was called Melita.
Acts 28:2 And the barbarians shewed us uncommon humanity: for they kindled a fire and took us all in, because of the present rain, and of the cold.
Acts 28:3 And Paul having gathered together a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came out a viper from the heat, and fastened on his hand.
Acts 28:4 And when the barbarians saw the <transChange>venomous</transChange> creature hanging on his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, though he hath been saved from the sea, yet justice suffereth not to live.
Acts 28:5 But he shook off the creature into the fire, and suffered no hurt.
Acts 28:6 They however were expecting that he would swell, or suddenly fall down dead: but when they had waited a good while, and saw no hurt come to him, they changed <transChange>their opinion</transChange> and said that he was a god.
Acts 28:7 Now in the parts adjacent to <transChange>this</transChange> place was the seat of the chief <transChange>man</transChange> of the island, whose name was Publius, who took us into <transChange>his house,</transChange> and entertained us three days courteously.
Acts 28:8 And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery: to whom Paul went in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
Acts 28:9 Upon this, others also in the island, who had diseases came to <transChange>him</transChange> and were cured:
Acts 28:10 who also honoured us with many honors, and furnished <transChange>us,</transChange> when we departed, with such things as were necessary.
Acts 28:11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
Acts 28:12 And being arrived at Syracuse, we staid <transChange>there</transChange> three days.
Acts 28:13 From whence coasting round we came to Rhegium, and after one day a south-wind rising, we came the second day to Puteoli:
Acts 28:14 where finding <transChange>some</transChange> brethren, we were desired to stay with them seven days: and so we went <transChange>on</transChange> to Rome.
Acts 28:15 And when the brethren heard of us, they came from thence to meet us, <transChange>some</transChange> as far as Appii-forum, and <transChange>others to</transChange> the Three-taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.
Acts 28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to live by himself with the soldier that had him in custody.
Acts 28:17 And after three days Paul called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were come together, he said unto them, Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people <transChange>of the Jews,</transChange> or the customs of <transChange>our</transChange> fathers, <transChange>yet</transChange> was I delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:
Acts 28:18 who when they had examined me, would have set <transChange>me</transChange> at liberty, because there was no crime <transChange>worthy</transChange> of death <transChange>found</transChange> in me:
Acts 28:19 but the Jews opposing <transChange>it,</transChange> I was obliged to appeal to Cesar; <transChange>though</transChange> not as having any thing to accuse my nation of.
Acts 28:20 For this reason therefore I desired to see and to speak to you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
Acts 28:21 And they said to him, We have neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor has any of the brethren, that is come hither, related or spoken any ill of thee.
Acts 28:22 But we would willingly hear from thee what thou thinkest: for as to this sect, we know that it is every where spoken against.
Acts 28:23 And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he discoursed and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and <transChange>from</transChange> the prophets, from morning till evening.
Acts 28:24 And some regarded the things that were spoken, but others did not believe.
Acts 28:25 And <transChange>so</transChange> disagreeing one with another they separated, when Paul had said one word, <transChange>to wit,</transChange> that the holy Spirit spake rightly by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,
Acts 28:26 saying, Go to this people and say, Ye shall hear by <transChange>the</transChange> hearing <transChange>of the ear,</transChange> and not understand; and <transChange>in</transChange> seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is stupified,
Acts 28:27 and they hear heavily with <transChange>their</transChange> ears, and have closed their eyes; least they should see at all with <transChange>their</transChange> eyes, and hear with <transChange>their</transChange> ears, and understand with <transChange>their</transChange> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
Acts 28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear <transChange>it.</transChange>
Acts 28:29 And when he had said these <transChange>things,</transChange> the Jews departed, having much debate among themselves.
Acts 28:30 And Paul abode two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came to him:
Acts 28:31 preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom, none forbidding him. <chapter eID="gen4877" osisID="Acts.28"/> <div eID="gen3873" osisID="Acts" type="book"/>

Romans 1:1 <hi type="bold">Paul</hi> a servant of Jesus Christ, called <transChange>to be</transChange> an apostle,
Romans 1:2 separated unto the gospel of God, (which He had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures) concerning his Son,
Romans 1:3 who was of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Romans 1:4 <transChange>but</transChange> powerfully declared <transChange>to be</transChange> the Son of God, according to the spirit of holiness, by <transChange>his</transChange> resurrection from the dead, even Jesus Christ our Lord;
Romans 1:5 by whom we have received grace and apostleship to <transChange>preach</transChange> the obedience of faith for his name's sake, to all nations;
Romans 1:6 among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ;
Romans 1:7 to all that are in Rome beloved of God, called <transChange>and</transChange> holy: grace <transChange>be</transChange> to you, and peace from God our Father, and <transChange>from</transChange> the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 1:8 And first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is celebrated through the whole world:
Romans 1:9 for God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how incessantly I make mention of you always in my prayers,
Romans 1:10 intreating if I may now at length have a prosperous journey by the will of God, to come unto you.
Romans 1:11 For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established:
Romans 1:12 that is <transChange>to say,</transChange> that <transChange>being</transChange> among you we may be comforted together by the faith of each, both yours and mine.
Romans 1:13 And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I often purposed to come unto you, (but have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.
Romans 1:14 <transChange>For</transChange> I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to <transChange>the</transChange> learned and <transChange>the</transChange> unlearned:
Romans 1:15 therefore am I ready, as much as in me <transChange>lies,</transChange> to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.
Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, both Jew and Greek:
Romans 1:17 for the righteousness of God is therein revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."
Romans 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who withhold the truth in unrighteousness;
Romans 1:19 for what is to be known of God is manifest among them, for God hath manifested it to them.
Romans 1:20 <transChange>Inasmuch</transChange> as from the <transChange>first</transChange> creation of the world, the invisible things of Him, <transChange>even</transChange> his eternal power and Godhead, are, if attended to, clearly seen in <transChange>his</transChange> works:
Romans 1:21 so that they are inexcusable; because having <transChange>thus</transChange> known God they glorified Him not as God, neither were they thankful; but were infatuated by their <transChange>own</transChange> reasonings, and their heart <transChange>being</transChange> void of understanding was darkened.
Romans 1:22 Pretending to be wise they Became fools:
Romans 1:23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for an image like to corruptible man, and birds, and <transChange>beasts,</transChange> and reptiles.
Romans 1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to impurity, in the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves;
Romans 1:25 who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature instead of the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans 1:26 Therefore God gave them up to infamous passions: for even their women changed the natural use into that which is unnatural,
Romans 1:27 and the men likewise, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust to one another, men with men committing shame, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which they deserved.
Romans 1:28 And as they were not careful to acknowledge God, God gave them up to an undiscerning mind to do things <transChange>that were</transChange> not fit <transChange>to be done:</transChange>
Romans 1:29 being filled with all injustice, lewdness, wickedness, covetousness, malignity; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, <transChange>and every</transChange> evil habit; whisperers,
Romans 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, injurious, haughty, proud, inventers of mischief, undutiful to parents, void of understanding,
Romans 1:31 covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, <transChange>and</transChange> unmerciful:
Romans 1:32 who though they knew the just judgement of God, (that they who commit such practises are worthy of death) <transChange>yet</transChange> not only do these very things, but also countenance <transChange>and encourage others</transChange> in the practice <transChange>of them.</transChange> <chapter eID="gen4910" osisID="Rom.1"/>
Romans 2:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.2" sID="gen4943"/>
Romans 2:1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art, that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost the same <transChange>things.</transChange>
Romans 2:2 But we know that the judgement of God is according to truth against those that do such <transChange>things.</transChange>
Romans 2:3 And thinkest thou, O man, who judgest those that do such <transChange>things,</transChange> and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God?
Romans 2:4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
Romans 2:5 But by thy hardness and impenitence of heart thou art treasuring up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgement of God,
Romans 2:6 who will render to every <transChange>one</transChange> according to his works:
Romans 2:7 to them, who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life:
Romans 2:8 but to those who are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath.
Romans 2:9 Tribulation and anguish <transChange>shall be</transChange> upon every soul of man that worketh evil, both of the Jew, and of the Gentile:
Romans 2:10 but glory, and honor, and peace to every <transChange>one</transChange> that worketh good, both to the Jew, and to the Greek:
Romans 2:11 for there is no respect of persons with God.
Romans 2:12 For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
Romans 2:13 (for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:
Romans 2:14 for when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature <transChange>the</transChange> <transChange>duties</transChange> of the law, these though they have not the law, are a law to themselves,
Romans 2:15 and shew the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience witnessing together with <transChange>it,</transChange> and their <transChange>own</transChange> thoughts either accusing, or excusing <transChange>them,</transChange>)
Romans 2:16 in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
Romans 2:17 Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest on the law, and boastest in God,
Romans 2:18 and knowest <transChange>his</transChange> will, and approvest things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
Romans 2:19 and art persuaded that thou art a guide of the blind,
Romans 2:20 a light to them that are in the darkness, an instructor of the simple, a teacher of babes, having the form of the knowledge and of the truth <transChange>which is</transChange> in the law.
Romans 2:21 Thou then, who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? <transChange>Thou,</transChange> that preachest <transChange>a man should</transChange> not steal, dost thou steal?
Romans 2:22 <transChange>Thou,</transChange> that sayest <transChange>a man should</transChange> not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? <transChange>Thou,</transChange> that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
Romans 2:23 <transChange>Thou,</transChange> that boastest in the law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?
Romans 2:24 for through you the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.
Romans 2:25 For circumcision indeed is profitable, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.
Romans 2:26 Therefore if the uncircumcised keep the righteous precepts of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be accounted to him for circumcision?
Romans 2:27 and shall not the uncircumcision that is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law? for he is not a Jew, who is <transChange>only</transChange> so in appearance;
Romans 2:28 nor is <transChange>that</transChange> circumcision, which is <transChange>only</transChange> in appearance, in the flesh;
Romans 2:29 but he <transChange>is</transChange> a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision <transChange>is that</transChange> of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter: whose praise is not from men, but from God. <chapter eID="gen4943" osisID="Rom.2"/>
Romans 3:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.3" sID="gen4973"/>
Romans 3:1 What then <transChange>is</transChange> the advantage of the Jew, or what <transChange>is</transChange> the profit of circumcision?
Romans 3:2 Much, every way: chiefly, because they were intrusted with the oracles of God.
Romans 3:3 For what if some did not believe? shall their incredulity make the faithfulness of God of no effect?
Romans 3:4 God forbid: yea, let God be <transChange>acknowledged</transChange> true, though every man <transChange>be</transChange> a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest overcome, when thou judgest.
Romans 3:5 "But if our unrighteousness confirm the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <transChange>Is</transChange> not God unrighteous, who inflicteth <transChange>his</transChange> wrath?" (I speak as a man) God forbid:
Romans 3:6 for then how shall God judge the world?
Romans 3:7 "But, <transChange>say you,</transChange> if the truth of God hath abounded unto his glory through my falshood, why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
Romans 3:8 and <transChange>why</transChange> may we not do evil that good may come?"---as we are injuriously charged, and as some affirm that we say; whose condemnation is just.
Romans 3:9 "What then are we the better?" Not at all, <transChange>in point of justification;</transChange> for we have before proved that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin: as it is written,
Romans 3:10 "There is none righteous, no not one;
Romans 3:11 there is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God.
Romans 3:12 They are all gone out of the way, they are become unprofitable, there is none that practiseth goodness, no not one.
Romans 3:13 Their throat <transChange>is</transChange> an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
Romans 3:14 whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
Romans 3:15 their feet <transChange>are</transChange> swift to shed blood:
Romans 3:16 destruction and misery <transChange>are</transChange> in their ways:
Romans 3:17 and the way of peace they have not known; <transChange>and</transChange> the fear of God is not before their eyes."
Romans 3:18 Now we know that whatsoever the law saith,
Romans 3:19 it saith to those under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world obnoxious to the justice of God.
Romans 3:20 Wherefore by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him: for by the law <transChange>is</transChange> the knowledge of sin.
Romans 3:21 But now, without <transChange>the</transChange> law, righteousness before God is manifested, being attested by the law and the prophets;
Romans 3:22 and <transChange>this</transChange> righteousness of God <transChange>is</transChange> by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all believers; for there is no difference;
Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God;
Romans 3:24 being justified freely by his grace, because of the redemption <transChange>that is</transChange> in Christ Jesus:
Romans 3:25 whom God hath appointed <transChange>to be</transChange> a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, in the remission of past sins, according to the forbearance of God;
Romans 3:26 for a demonstration, <transChange>I say,</transChange> of his righteousness at this time: that He might be just, and the justifier of him, that believeth in Jesus.
Romans 3:27 Where then <transChange>is</transChange> boasting? it is excluded: by what law? of works? no: but by the law of faith.
Romans 3:28 Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law:
Romans 3:29 or is He the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles?
Romans 3:30 surely of the Gentiles also: seeing <transChange>it is</transChange> one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision <transChange>also</transChange> through faith.
Romans 3:31 Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: yea we establish the law. <chapter eID="gen4973" osisID="Rom.3"/>
Romans 4:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.4" sID="gen5005"/>
Romans 4:1 What shall we say then that Abraham our father obtained according to the flesh?
Romans 4:2 for if Abraham were justified by works, he hath something to boast of; but <transChange>this he hath</transChange> not before God:
Romans 4:3 for what saith the scripture? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."
Romans 4:4 Now to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned as a favor, but as a debt:
Romans 4:5 but to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him who justifieth the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.
Romans 4:6 As David also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom: God imputeth righteousness without works, <transChange>saying,</transChange>
Romans 4:7 "Blessed <transChange>are</transChange> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered:
Romans 4:8 blessed <transChange>is</transChange> the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin."
Romans 4:9 Now <transChange>is</transChange> this blessedness upon the circumcised <transChange>only,</transChange> or upon the uncircumcised also? for we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.
Romans 4:10 How then was it accounted <transChange>to him?</transChange> when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
Romans 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision <transChange>as</transChange> a seal of the righteousness of the faith <transChange>which he had</transChange> in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all that believe though not circumcised, that righteousness may be imputed to them also:
Romans 4:12 and the father of circumcision to those, who not only are of the circumcision, but also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.
Romans 4:13 For the promise <transChange>made</transChange> to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world, <transChange>was</transChange> not by the law, but by the righteousness of faith:
Romans 4:14 for if they <transChange>only</transChange> that are of the law be heirs, faith is made useless, and the promise is become of no effect.
Romans 4:15 Now the law worketh wrath; for where there is no law, <transChange>there is</transChange> no transgression.
Romans 4:16 <transChange>And</transChange> therefore <transChange>it is</transChange> of faith, that <transChange>it might be</transChange> by grace, that <transChange>so</transChange> the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only <transChange>which is</transChange> of the law, but also to that <transChange>which is</transChange> of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
Romans 4:17 (as it is written, "I have made thee a father of many nations,") in the sight of <transChange>Him</transChange> whom he believed, <transChange>even</transChange> God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not as if they were:
Romans 4:18 who against hope believed, with hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that which was said <transChange>unto him,</transChange> "So shall thy seed be."
Romans 4:19 And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, being about an hundred years old; nor the deadness of Sarah's womb.
Romans 4:20 He hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief: but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,
Romans 4:21 and being fully persuaded, that what was promised He was able to perform:
Romans 4:22 and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
Romans 4:23 Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed to him:
Romans 4:24 but for our sakes also, to him it will be imputed, as we believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead:
Romans 4:25 who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. <chapter eID="gen5005" osisID="Rom.4"/>
Romans 5:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.5" sID="gen5031"/>
Romans 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
Romans 5:2 through whom also we have admission by faith into this grace in which we stand, and boast in hope of the glory of God.
Romans 5:3 And not only <transChange>so,</transChange> but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience,
Romans 5:4 and patience experience,
Romans 5:5 and experience hope, and <transChange>this</transChange> hope maketh <transChange>us</transChange> not ashamed; because the love of God is diffused in our hearts by the holy Spirit that is given to us.
Romans 5:6 For when we were yet without strength, Christ died in <transChange>due</transChange> season for the ungodly.
Romans 5:7 Whereas one would hardly die for a just <transChange>man,</transChange> though perhaps for a good <transChange>man</transChange> one might dare even to die.
Romans 5:8 But God recommendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans 5:9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through Him.
Romans 5:10 For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled shall we be saved by his life.
Romans 5:11 And not only <transChange>so,</transChange> but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
Romans 5:12 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so death passed upon all men, for to that all have sinned:
Romans 5:13 for sin was in the world before the law. Now sin is not imputed where there is no law;
Romans 5:14 <transChange>and</transChange> yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the type of Him that was to come.
Romans 5:15 But not as the offence, so also <transChange>is</transChange> the free gift: for if through the offence of one many died, much more hath the grace of God, and the gift <transChange>bestowed</transChange> by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.
Romans 5:16 For the gift is not as <transChange>the sentence was</transChange> by one that sinned; for the sentence <transChange>is passed</transChange> from one <transChange>offence</transChange> to condemnation, but the free gift <transChange>is</transChange> of many offences to justification.
Romans 5:17 For if, by the offence of one, death reigned through one, much more they who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life through one, <transChange>even</transChange> Jesus Christ.
Romans 5:18 Therefore as by the offence of one <transChange>the effect of it was</transChange> upon all men to condemnation: so also by the righteousness of one, <transChange>the effect was</transChange> upon all men to justification of life.
Romans 5:19 For as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners; so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.
Romans 5:20 Now the law made some entrance, that the offence might <transChange>appear to</transChange> abound; but where sin abounded, grace hath superabounded; that as sin had reigned in death,
Romans 5:21 so grace might reign through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. <chapter eID="gen5031" osisID="Rom.5"/>
Romans 6:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.6" sID="gen5053"/>
Romans 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
Romans 6:2 God forbid! how shall we, who are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
Romans 6:3 Know ye not, that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?
Romans 6:4 Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life:
Romans 6:5 for if we have been planted together in the resemblance of his death, so shall we be also of <transChange>his</transChange> resurrection.
Romans 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <transChange>Him,</transChange> that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer be inslaved to sin:
Romans 6:7 for he that is <transChange>thus</transChange> dead <transChange>with Christ,</transChange> is delivered from sin.
Romans 6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him:
Romans 6:9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more power over Him: for as He died, He died once for all on account of sin;
Romans 6:10 but as He liveth, He liveth unto God.
Romans 6:11 So also do ye reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to obey it in the lusts thereof.
Romans 6:13 Neither yield your bodies <transChange>as</transChange> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God.
Romans 6:14 For sin shall have no power over you, inasmuch as ye are not under the law, but under grace.
Romans 6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?
Romans 6:16 God forbid! Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants to obedience, <transChange>his</transChange> servants ye are whom ye obey? either of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
Romans 6:17 But thanks <transChange>be</transChange> to God, that ye <transChange>who</transChange> were servants of sin, have obeyed from the heart <transChange>that</transChange> form of doctrine which was delivered to you:
Romans 6:18 and being set free from sin, ye are become the servants of righteousness.
Romans 6:19 I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh: as ye have yielded your bodies servants to impurity and iniquity to <transChange>work</transChange> iniquity; so now present your bodies servants to righteousness, unto holiness.
Romans 6:20 For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
Romans 6:21 What fruit therefore had ye then <transChange>in the things,</transChange> which ye are now ashamed of? for the end of those things <transChange>is</transChange> death.
Romans 6:22 But now being set free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin <transChange>is</transChange> death: but the gift of God <transChange>is</transChange> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <chapter eID="gen5053" osisID="Rom.6"/>
Romans 7:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.7" sID="gen5077"/>
Romans 7:1 Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath power over a man, <transChange>only</transChange> so long as it liveth?
Romans 7:2 For a married woman is bound by the law to <transChange>her</transChange> husband <transChange>while he is</transChange> living; but if <transChange>her</transChange> husband die, she is discharged from the law of <transChange>her</transChange> husband.
Romans 7:3 Therefore while <transChange>her</transChange> husband is living, she shall be called an adulteress if she become another man's: but if <transChange>her</transChange> husband be dead, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though she become another man's.
Romans 7:4 And thus, my brethren, ye also are dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye might become another's, <transChange>even his</transChange> who is raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.
Romans 7:5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions <transChange>while we were</transChange> under the law operated in our bodies <transChange>so</transChange> as to bring forth fruit unto death.
Romans 7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, <transChange>that</transChange> being dead by which we were bound, that we might serve <transChange>God</transChange> in newness of spirit, and not <transChange>in the</transChange> oldness of <transChange>the</transChange> letter.
Romans 7:7 What shall we say then? <transChange>is</transChange> the law sin? God forbid! Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust <transChange>to be sinful,</transChange> if the law had not said, "Thou shalt not covet."
Romans 7:8 But sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence: for without the law sin <transChange>was</transChange> dead.
Romans 7:9 And I was heretofore alive without the law: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died:
Romans 7:10 and the commandment <transChange>which was intended</transChange> to life, I found <transChange>to be</transChange> unto death.
Romans 7:11 For sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me, and by it slew me.
Romans 7:12 So that the law is holy; and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
Romans 7:13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good: that sin might be <transChange>shewn</transChange> by the commandment <transChange>to be</transChange> exceeding sinful.
Romans 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
Romans 7:15 For that which I do, I allow not: for I do not that which I would; but what I hate, this I do.
Romans 7:16 And if I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good:
Romans 7:17 but now I am no more the doer of it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
Romans 7:18 For I know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good: for to will is present with me, but <transChange>how</transChange> to perform <transChange>that which is</transChange> good, I find not.
Romans 7:19 For I do not the good that I would; but the evil which I would not, this I do.
Romans 7:20 Now if I do that which I would not, I am no more the doer of it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
Romans 7:21 I find then a <transChange>kind of</transChange> law, that when I would do good, evil besets me.
Romans 7:22 For I delight in the law of God, as to the inward man:
Romans 7:23 but I perceive another law in my body warring against the law of my mind, and captivating me to the law of sin, which is in my body.
Romans 7:24 Wretched man <transChange>that</transChange> I <transChange>am!</transChange> who shall deliver me from this body of death?
Romans 7:25 The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with my mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. <chapter eID="gen5077" osisID="Rom.7"/>
Romans 8:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.8" sID="gen5103"/>
Romans 8:1 <transChange>There is</transChange> therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.
Romans 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath set me free from the law of sin and death.
Romans 8:3 For that which was impossible for the law <transChange>to do, and</transChange> in which it was weak through <transChange>the corruption of</transChange> the flesh, God <transChange>by</transChange> sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh <transChange>to be a sacrifice</transChange> for sin, hath <transChange>done; that is,</transChange> hath condemned sin in the flesh:
Romans 8:4 that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.
Romans 8:5 For they who are after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but they who are led by the Spirit, <transChange>do mind</transChange> spiritual <transChange>things.</transChange>
Romans 8:6 Now to be carnally minded <transChange>is</transChange> death; but to be spiritually minded <transChange>is</transChange> life and peace:
Romans 8:7 because the carnal mind is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be:
Romans 8:8 and they who are carnal, cannot please God.
Romans 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwelleth in you: but if any <transChange>one</transChange> hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
Romans 8:10 And if Christ <transChange>be</transChange> in you, the body indeed <transChange>is</transChange> dead because of sin, but the spirit <transChange>is</transChange> alive because of righteousness.
Romans 8:11 And if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwelleth in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead, will also restore your mortal bodies to life, by his Spirit that <transChange>now</transChange> dwelleth in you.
Romans 8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:
Romans 8:13 for if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if by the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
Romans 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.
Romans 8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
Romans 8:16 <transChange>So that</transChange> the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
Romans 8:17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and co-heirs with Christ: if so be we suffer with <transChange>Him,</transChange> that we may be also glorified with <transChange>Him.</transChange>
Romans 8:18 And I account the sufferings of this present time not worthy <transChange>to be set</transChange> against the glory that shall be revealed to us.
Romans 8:19 For the earnest expectation of the world is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God:
Romans 8:20 (for the world was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but through him who made it subject:)
Romans 8:21 in hope that they also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
Romans 8:22 For we know that the whole world groaneth, and doth <transChange>as it were</transChange> travail in pain together even to this day.
Romans 8:23 And not only <transChange>others,</transChange> but those also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, <transChange>to wit</transChange> the redemption of our body.
Romans 8:24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen, is not hope; for what any <transChange>one</transChange> sees, how doth he yet hope for?
Romans 8:25 but if we hope for what we see not, <transChange>then</transChange> we wait for it with patience.
Romans 8:26 And the Spirit likewise helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for, as we ought: but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with unutterable groans.
Romans 8:27 And He that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit; for he intercedeth for the saints according to <transChange>the will of</transChange> God.
Romans 8:28 And we know that all <transChange>things</transChange> co-operate for good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose;
Romans 8:29 for those whom he foreknew, He also predetermined <transChange>to be</transChange> conformed to the image of his Son, that He might be <transChange>as</transChange> the first-born among many brethren: and whom He before ordained, these He also called;
Romans 8:30 and whom He called, these he also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.
Romans 8:31 What shall we say then to these <transChange>things?</transChange> if God <transChange>be</transChange> for us, who <transChange>can be</transChange> against us?
Romans 8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him freely give us all <transChange>things?</transChange>
Romans 8:33 Who shall lay <transChange>any</transChange> accusation against the elect of God? <transChange>will</transChange> God, who justifieth <transChange>us?</transChange>
Romans 8:34 Who <transChange>is</transChange> he that condemneth? <transChange>Is it</transChange> Christ, that died <transChange>for us?</transChange> yea rather, that is risen again, who is also at the right <transChange>hand</transChange> of God, and who maketh intercession for us?
Romans 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? <transChange>shall</transChange> affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
Romans 8:36 (as it is written, "for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter:")
Romans 8:37 but in all these <transChange>things</transChange> we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.
Romans 8:38 For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor <transChange>things</transChange> present, nor <transChange>things</transChange> future,
Romans 8:39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which <transChange>is</transChange> in Christ Jesus our Lord. <chapter eID="gen5103" osisID="Rom.8"/>
Romans 9:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.9" sID="gen5143"/>
Romans 9:1 I say the truth in Christ, I lye not, (my conscience bearing me witness in the holy Ghost,)
Romans 9:2 that I have great grief and continual sorrow in my heart:
Romans 9:3 for I could wish that I myself were made a curse after the manner of Christ, for my brethren, my kindred according to the flesh;
Romans 9:4 who are Israelites, whose <transChange>is</transChange> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the <transChange>form of</transChange> divine worship, and the promises:
Romans 9:5 whose <transChange>are</transChange> the fathers, and of whom, as to the flesh, Christ <transChange>came,</transChange> who is over all God blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans 9:6 Not that the word of God hath failed. For they <transChange>are</transChange> not all Israel, who are <transChange>descended</transChange> from Israel.
Romans 9:7 Nor because they are the seed of Abraham, <transChange>are they</transChange> all children <transChange>of promise:</transChange> but "in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
Romans 9:8 That is, not the children of the flesh <transChange>are</transChange> the children of God, but the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.
Romans 9:9 For this <transChange>is</transChange> the word of <transChange>the</transChange> promise, "According to this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son:"
Romans 9:10 and not <transChange>to her</transChange> only; but Rebecca also being with child by our father Isaac,
Romans 9:11 (when <transChange>the children</transChange> were not yet born, nor had done either good or evil, that the purpose of God according to <transChange>his</transChange> choice might abide, not <transChange>on account</transChange> of works, but of Him that calleth,) it was said to her, the elder shall serve the younger:
Romans 9:12 as it is written,
Romans 9:13 "I loved Jacob and I hated Esau."
Romans 9:14 What shall we say then? <transChange>Is there</transChange> injustice in God?
Romans 9:15 God forbid! For He saith to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I <transChange>will</transChange> have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I <transChange>will</transChange> have compassion."
Romans 9:16 So then <transChange>it is</transChange> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
Romans 9:17 And the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, for this very purpose have I raised thee up, that I may shew forth my power in thee, and that my name may be declared through all the earth.
Romans 9:18 So then He hath mercy on whom He pleaseth, and whom He will, He hardeneth.
Romans 9:19 Thou wilt say then, Why doth he yet blame <transChange>us?</transChange> who hath resisted his will?
Romans 9:20 Nay but, O man, who art thou, that disputest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed <transChange>it,</transChange> Why didst thou make me thus?
Romans 9:21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, out of the same mass to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?
Romans 9:22 And <transChange>what</transChange> if God, <transChange>though</transChange> resolved to shew his displeasure <transChange>at last,</transChange> and to make known his power, <transChange>yet</transChange> bore with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?
Romans 9:23 and that He might make known the riches of his glory in the vessels of mercy, which He hath prepared for glory?
Romans 9:24 whom He hath also called, <transChange>even</transChange> us, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.
Romans 9:25 As He saith also in Hosea, I will call <transChange>them</transChange> my people, who were not my people, and <transChange>her</transChange> beloved, who was not beloved.
Romans 9:26 And in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.
Romans 9:27 And Esaias crieth out concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, <transChange>only</transChange> a remnant shall be saved.
Romans 9:28 For <transChange>in</transChange> finishing the account and cutting <transChange>it</transChange> short in righteousness, the Lord will make a short work upon the earth.
Romans 9:29 And as Esaias said before, "Except the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and we had been made like unto Gomorrah."
Romans 9:30 What shall we say then? that the Gentiles, who sought not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;
Romans 9:31 but Israel, who followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness: why?
Romans 9:32 because <transChange>they sought it</transChange> not by faith, but by the works of the law, for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone;
Romans 9:33 as it is written, "Behold I lay in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence:" and <transChange>again,</transChange> "Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed." <chapter eID="gen5143" osisID="Rom.9"/>
Romans 10:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.10" sID="gen5177"/>
Romans 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved.
Romans 10:2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
Romans 10:3 For being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness <transChange>which is</transChange> of God.
Romans 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law, for righteousness to every believer.
Romans 10:5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, "That the man who doth those <transChange>things</transChange> shall live by them."
Romans 10:6 But the righteousness <transChange>which is</transChange> of faith speaketh thus, "Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, (that is, to bring Christ down) or,
Romans 10:7 who shall descend into the deep, (that is, to
Romans 10:8 bring up Christ from the dead)" but what saith <transChange>it?</transChange> "The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart." This is the word of faith which we preach: that if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
Romans 10:9 and believe in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Romans 10:10 For with the heart <transChange>man</transChange> believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Romans 10:11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on Him, shall not be ashamed.
Romans 10:12 For there is no difference of Jew and Greek: for He <transChange>being</transChange> Lord of all is bountiful to all that call upon Him.
Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Romans 10:14 But how shall they call upon <transChange>him</transChange> in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe <transChange>on him</transChange> of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
Romans 10:15 and how shall they preach unless they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good tidings of peace, who bring the good tidings of good <transChange>things?</transChange>
Romans 10:16 But all have not obeyed the gospel: for Esaias saith, "Lord, who hath believed our report?"
Romans 10:17 So that faith <transChange>cometh</transChange> by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
Romans 10:18 But I say, Have they not heard? Verily their sound is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
Romans 10:19 But I say <transChange>again,</transChange> Did not Israel know <transChange>this? when</transChange> first Moses saith, "I will move you to jealousy by <transChange>those who are</transChange> not a people, I will provoke you to anger by a foolish nation:"
Romans 10:20 and Esaias positively affirms, "I was found of them that sought me not, I was made manifest to them that asked not after me:"
Romans 10:21 and saith to Israel, "All the day long have I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people." <chapter eID="gen5177" osisID="Rom.10"/>
Romans 11:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.11" sID="gen5199"/>
Romans 11:1 I say then, Hath God cast off his people? God forbid! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans 11:2 God hath not cast off his people, whom He foreknew. Do ye not know what the scripture saith of Elias? how he complains to God against Israel,
Romans 11:3 saying, "Lord, they have slain thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
Romans 11:4 But what saith the oracle of God to him? "I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
Romans 11:5 And so in the present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
Romans 11:6 And if by grace, <transChange>it is</transChange> no more of works: for <transChange>then</transChange> grace is no longer grace. But if of works, it is no more grace: for <transChange>then</transChange> work is no longer work.
Romans 11:7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he sought: but the elect have obtained <transChange>it,</transChange> and the rest were blinded,
Romans 11:8 (according as it is written, God hath given them a spirit of slumber, that their eyes could not see and their ears could not hear,) <transChange>even</transChange> unto this day.
Romans 11:9 And David saith, Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompence unto them.
Romans 11:10 Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and always bow down their back.
Romans 11:11 Say I then, Have they stumbled, that they should fall <transChange>irrecoverably?</transChange> God forbid! but <transChange>this I say, that</transChange> by their fall salvation <transChange>is come</transChange> to the Gentiles to excite them to emulation.
Romans 11:12 Now if their fall <transChange>be</transChange> the riches of the world, and their diminution <transChange>be</transChange> the riches of the Gentiles, how much more <transChange>will</transChange> their fulness <transChange>be?</transChange>
Romans 11:13 For I speak to you Gentiles: inasmuch indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles,
Romans 11:14 I extol my office, that if possible I may excite to emulation my <transChange>brethren according to the</transChange> flesh, and may save some of them:
Romans 11:15 for if the rejecting of them <transChange>be</transChange> the reconciling of the world, what <transChange>will</transChange> the receiving <transChange>them again be</transChange> but life from the dead?
Romans 11:16 Now if the first-fruits <transChange>be</transChange> holy, so <transChange>is</transChange> the <transChange>whole</transChange> heap: and if the root <transChange>be</transChange> holy, so <transChange>are</transChange> the branches.
Romans 11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou a wild-olive wert grafted in among them, and art made a partaker together <transChange>with them</transChange> of the root and fatness of the olive; boast not against the branches:
Romans 11:18 and if thou boastest, <transChange>remember</transChange> thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
Romans 11:19 Wilt thou say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in?
Romans 11:20 Well; they were broken off for <transChange>their</transChange> infidelity, and thou standest by faith: <transChange>therefore</transChange> be not high-minded but fear.
Romans 11:21 For if God spared not the natural branches, neither would He spare thee.
Romans 11:22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: towards them that fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness; if thou continue in <transChange>his</transChange> goodness: for <transChange>else</transChange> thou also shalt be cut off.
Romans 11:23 And they, if they do not continue in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able again to graft them in.
Romans 11:24 For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive, which was natural <transChange>to thee,</transChange> and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive; how much more shall these <transChange>who are</transChange> the natural <transChange>branches,</transChange> be grafted into their own olive-tree?
Romans 11:25 For I would not have you, brethren, to be ignorant of this mystery, (least ye should be wise in your own eyes) that blindness in part is befallen Israel, till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
Romans 11:26 And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, "The deliverer shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away impiety from Jacob:
Romans 11:27 and this <transChange>is</transChange> my covenant with them, when I take away their sins."
Romans 11:28 As to the gospel indeed they are enemies on your account, but as to the election they are beloved on account of the fathers.
Romans 11:29 For the gifts and calling of God <transChange>are</transChange> without repentance.
Romans 11:30 For as ye were heretofore disobedient to God, but have now obtained mercy in their disobedience:
Romans 11:31 so these also in your mercy have now been disobedient, that they themselves might be the objects of mercy.
Romans 11:32 For God hath included them all in <transChange>the charge of</transChange> disobedience, that He might have mercy upon all.
Romans 11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <transChange>are</transChange> his judgements, and his ways not to be traced out!
Romans 11:34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor?
Romans 11:35 Or who hath first given to Him? and it shall be returned.
Romans 11:36 For of Him, and through Him, and for Him, <transChange>are</transChange> all <transChange>things.</transChange> To Him be glory for ever. Amen. <chapter eID="gen5199" osisID="Rom.11"/>
Romans 12:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.12" sID="gen5236"/>
Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, <transChange>and</transChange> well-pleasing to God, <transChange>as</transChange> your rational service.
Romans 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may experience what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.
Romans 12:3 For by the grace conferred on me I charge every one among you, not to think <transChange>of himself</transChange> above what he ought to think: but to think with sobriety, according as God hath divided to every man the measure of faith.
Romans 12:4 For as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office:
Romans 12:5 so we <transChange>who are</transChange> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members of each other.
Romans 12:6 But having different gifts, according to the grace conferred upon us, whether prophecy, <transChange>let us prophesy</transChange> according to the proportion of <transChange>our</transChange> faith:
Romans 12:7 or ministry, <transChange>let us attend</transChange> to the ministry: or he that teacheth, on teaching: or he that exhorteth, on exhortation:
Romans 12:8 he that distributeth, let him do it with integrity: he that presideth, with diligence: he that sheweth mercy, with chearfulness.
Romans 12:9 <transChange>Let</transChange> love <transChange>be</transChange> unfeigned. Abhor <transChange>that which is</transChange> evil, cleave to that which is good;
Romans 12:10 <transChange>be</transChange> tenderly affected with brotherly love to each other, in honor preferring one another:
Romans 12:11 not slothful in business: fervent in spirit: serving the Lord.
Romans 12:12 Rejoicing in hope, patient under affliction, persevering in prayer,
Romans 12:13 communicating to the necessities of the saints, given to hospitality.
Romans 12:14 Bless them that persecute you: bless <transChange>them, I say,</transChange> and do not curse <transChange>them.</transChange>
Romans 12:15 Rejoice with those that rejoice, and weep with those that weep.
Romans 12:16 <transChange>Be</transChange> alike affected to each other: not aiming at high things, but accommodating <transChange>yourselves</transChange> to persons of low rank. Be not wise in your own conceit.
Romans 12:17 Render to no one evil for evil: behaving honorably in the sight of all men.
Romans 12:18 If <transChange>it be</transChange> possible, as much as ye can, live peaceably with all men.
Romans 12:19 Avenge not yourselves, <transChange>my</transChange> beloved; but <transChange>rather</transChange> give place to the wrath <transChange>of others:</transChange> for it is written, "Vengeance <transChange>belongeth</transChange> to me, I will recompence, saith the Lord."
Romans 12:20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for <transChange>in</transChange> so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
Romans 12:21 Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. <chapter eID="gen5236" osisID="Rom.12"/>
Romans 13:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.13" sID="gen5258"/>
Romans 13:1 Let every soul be subject to the powers <transChange>that are</transChange> over <transChange>them:</transChange> for there is no <transChange>such</transChange> power but from God: the powers that are <transChange>over men,</transChange> are appointed by God.
Romans 13:2 So that he who resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive condemnation.
Romans 13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wouldest thou then not be afraid of the <transChange>civil</transChange> power? do <transChange>what is</transChange> good, and thou shalt have praise from it:
Romans 13:4 for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou dost evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is <transChange>also</transChange> the minister of God, <transChange>as</transChange> an avenger to <transChange>execute his</transChange> wrath upon the malefactor.
Romans 13:5 Wherefore it is necessary to submit, not only on account of punishment, but also of conscience.
Romans 13:6 For you pay <transChange>them</transChange> tribute also for this <transChange>reason;</transChange> because they are God's ministers, continually attending hereunto.
Romans 13:7 Render therefore to all <transChange>what is</transChange> their due: tribute to whom tribute <transChange>is due,</transChange> custom to whom custom, reverence to whom reverence, honor to whom honor.
Romans 13:8 Owe no one any thing, but to love one another; for he that loveth others hath fulfilled the law:
Romans 13:9 for this <transChange>command,</transChange> Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet, and every other <transChange>social</transChange> precept, is summed up in this, namely, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
Romans 13:10 Love worketh no evil to <transChange>our</transChange> neighbour: therefore love <transChange>is</transChange> the fulfilling of the law.
Romans 13:11 And this <transChange>let us observe,</transChange> knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we <transChange>first</transChange> believed.
Romans 13:12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
Romans 13:13 Let us behave decently as <transChange>being</transChange> in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lasciviousness, not in strife and envying.
Romans 13:14 But put on the Lord Jesus, and make not provision for the flesh to <transChange>gratify its irregular</transChange> desires. <chapter eID="gen5258" osisID="Rom.13"/>
Romans 14:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.14" sID="gen5273"/>
Romans 14:1 Receive him that is weak in the faith, <transChange>but</transChange> not to disputes about doubtful matters:
Romans 14:2 for one believeth that he may eat any <transChange>food;</transChange> another, who is weak, liveth upon herbs.
Romans 14:3 Let not him, that eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him, that eateth not, censure him that eateth: for God hath received him.
Romans 14:4 Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? To his own master he standeth or falleth: yea, he shall be established; for God is able to establish him.
Romans 14:5 One preferreth some days to others; another esteemeth every day <transChange>alike.</transChange> Let every <transChange>one</transChange> be fully satisfied in his own mind.
Romans 14:6 He that regardeth a day regardeth <transChange>it</transChange> to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, <transChange>in deference</transChange> to the Lord he doth not regard <transChange>it</transChange>. <transChange>So</transChange> he, that eateth <transChange>all sorts of food,</transChange> eateth to the Lord; for he giveth God thanks <transChange>for it;</transChange> and he that eateth not <transChange>of some kinds of food, in deference</transChange> to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks <transChange>for the rest.</transChange>
Romans 14:7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no one dieth to himself:
Romans 14:8 but if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
Romans 14:9 For to this <transChange>end</transChange> Christ both died, and rose, and lives again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
Romans 14:10 But why dost thou censure thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? since we shall all stand before the tribunal of Christ;
Romans 14:11 for it is written, <transChange>As</transChange> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
Romans 14:12 So that every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.
Romans 14:13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, not to lay a stumbling-block or scandal before a brother.
Romans 14:14 I know and have been taught by the Lord Jesus, that nothing <transChange>is</transChange> unclean of itself: only to him that thinketh any <transChange>thing</transChange> unclean, to him <transChange>it is</transChange> unclean.
Romans 14:15 But if thy brother be grieved by <transChange>thy</transChange> food, thou dost not herein walk in love. Do not by thy food destroy him, for whom Christ died.
Romans 14:16 Let not your liberty then be evil-spoken of: for the kingdom of God consists not in meat and drink;
Romans 14:17 but <transChange>in</transChange> righteousness and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost: for he,
Romans 14:18 that in these serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men.
Romans 14:19 Let us then pursue peace, and mutual edification.
Romans 14:20 Do not for the sake of meat destroy <transChange>thy brother who is</transChange> the work of God: all <transChange>things</transChange> indeed <transChange>are</transChange> pure; but to the man that eateth with offence <transChange>it is</transChange> evil.
Romans 14:21 <transChange>It is</transChange> good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <transChange>to do any thing</transChange> at which thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or weakened.
Romans 14:22 Thou <transChange>who</transChange> hast faith, have <transChange>it</transChange> to thyself before God: <transChange>and</transChange> happy <transChange>is</transChange> he that condemneth not himself in what he alloweth <transChange>himself to do.</transChange>
Romans 14:23 But he that hath <transChange>any</transChange> scruple, is condemned if he eat; because <transChange>he doth it</transChange> not with faith: and whatsoever <transChange>is</transChange> not of faith, is sin. <chapter eID="gen5273" osisID="Rom.14"/>
Romans 15:0 <chapter osisID="Rom.15" sID="gen5297"/>
Romans 15:1 Now we that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves:
Romans 15:2 but let every one of us please <transChange>our</transChange> neighbor for <transChange>his</transChange> good, to <transChange>his</transChange> edification.
Romans 15:3 For Christ also pleased not himself; but as it is written, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me."
Romans 15:4 For whatever <transChange>things</transChange> were written heretofore, were written for our instruction; that we through patience and the consolation of the scriptures might have hope.
Romans 15:5 And may the God of patience and consolation grant you the like <transChange>mutual</transChange> affection to each other, according to <transChange>the example of</transChange> Christ Jesus:
Romans 15:6 that with one mind <transChange>and</transChange> one mouth ye may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 15:7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ hath received us, to the glory of God.
Romans 15:8 Now Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for <transChange>the manifestation of</transChange> the truth of God, to confirm the promises <transChange>made</transChange> to the fathers:
Romans 15:9 and that the Gentiles might glorify God for <transChange>his</transChange> mercy, as it is written, "For this <transChange>cause</transChange> will I celebrate Thee among the Gentiles, and sing <transChange>praises</transChange> unto thy name."
Romans 15:10 And again he saith, "Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people."
Romans 15:11 And again, "Praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise Him, all ye people."
Romans 15:12 And again Esaias saith, "There shall be a root of Jesse, and one that shall rise to rule over the Gentiles: in Him shall the Gentiles trust."
Romans 15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy Spirit.
Romans 15:14 And I myself am indeed persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that ye are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another.
Romans 15:15 However, I have written to you, brethren, somewhat the more freely, in reminding you <transChange>of your duty;</transChange> because of the favor bestowed upon me by God,
Romans 15:16 that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, administring the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy Spirit.
Romans 15:17 I have therefore <transChange>matter of</transChange> glorying in Christ Jesus, as to the <transChange>things</transChange> of God.
Romans 15:18 For I shall not go about to speak of any <transChange>thing,</transChange> but what Christ hath wrought by me, (to <transChange>gain</transChange> the obedience of the Gentiles,) <transChange>both</transChange> in word and deed:
Romans 15:19 through the efficacy of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round as far as to Illyricum, I have fully declared the gospel of Christ:
Romans 15:20 being studious however so to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, least I should build upon another <transChange>man's</transChange> foundation;
Romans 15:21 but as it is written, They, to whom nothing was said concerning Him, shall see, and they who have not heard, shall understand.
Romans 15:22 And thus I have been much hindered from coming to you:
Romans 15:23 but now having no more to detain me in these parts, and having <transChange>had</transChange> a great desire for many years to come to you, when I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
Romans 15:24 for I hope to see you as I pass by, and to be brought forward by you <transChange>on my way</transChange> thither, after I have first had some enjoyment of you.
Romans 15:25 But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
Romans 15:26 For the Macedonians and Achaians have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem.
Romans 15:27 It pleased them, <transChange>I say,</transChange> and they are <transChange>indeed</transChange> their debtors; for if the Gentiles have partook of their spiritual <transChange>things,</transChange> they ought also to be helpful to them in carnal <transChange>ones.</transChange>
Romans 15:28 Therefore when I have dispatched this, and sealed this fruit <transChange>of love</transChange> to them, I will come by you into Spain.
Romans 15:29 And I know that when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
Romans 15:30 Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye earnestly strive together with me in prayers to God for me;
Romans 15:31 that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea; and that this my service at Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints:
Romans 15:32 that I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.
Romans 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. <chapter eID="gen5297" osisID="Rom.15"/>

Romans 16:1 I recommend to you Phebe, our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea:
Romans 16:2 that ye receive her in the Lord as becometh saints, and assist her in whatever affair she may have need of you; for <transChange>she</transChange> also hath been a helper of many <transChange>others,</transChange> as well as of myself.
Romans 16:3 Salute Priscilla and Aquila my fellow-laborers in Christ Jesus:

Romans 16:16 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
Romans 16:17 Now I exhort you, brethren, to mark those who cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned:
Romans 16:18 and avoid them; for such <transChange>people</transChange> serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by a soothing address and good words deceive the hearts of the innocent.
Romans 16:19 For your obedience is come to <transChange>the knowledge of</transChange> all: <transChange>and</transChange> therefore I rejoice on your account; but <transChange>yet</transChange> I would have you wise to that which is good, and simple as to that which is evil.
Romans 16:20 And the God of peace will soon bruise Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <transChange>be</transChange> with you. Amen.
Romans 16:21 Timothy my fellow-laborer, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
Romans 16:22 I Tertius, who wrote <transChange>this</transChange> epistle, salute you in the Lord.
Romans 16:23 Gaius my host, and <transChange>that</transChange> of the whole church saluteth you. Erastus, the chamberlain of the city, and <transChange>our</transChange> brother Quartus saluteth you.
Romans 16:24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <transChange>be</transChange> with you all. Amen.
Romans 16:25 Now to Him that is able to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, (conformable to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret in former times,
Romans 16:26 but is now manifested, and made known to all nations by the writings of the prophets, according to the appointment of the eternal God,

I Corinthians 1:9 <transChange>for</transChange> God is faithful by whom ye were called into the communion of his son Jesus Christ our Lord.
I Corinthians 1:10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye would all say alike, and <transChange>that</transChange> there may be no schisms among you, but <transChange>that</transChange> ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgement.
I Corinthians 1:11 For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by some of Chloe's <transChange>family,</transChange> that there are contentions among you.
I Corinthians 1:12 I mean, that each of you saith, <transChange>as if of different parties,</transChange> I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
I Corinthians 1:13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
I Corinthians 1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius:
I Corinthians 1:15 <transChange>so</transChange> that no one can say I baptized in my own name.
I Corinthians 1:16 I also baptized indeed the family of Stephanas: <transChange>but</transChange> I know not whether I baptized any other.
I Corinthians 1:17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in fine speech, least the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.
I Corinthians 1:18 For the doctrine of the cross is to them, that perish, foolishness: but to us, who are saved, it is the power of God.
I Corinthians 1:19 For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
I Corinthians 1:20 Where <transChange>is</transChange> the wise? where <transChange>is</transChange> the scribe? where is the disputant of the age? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
I Corinthians 1:21 For, since in the wisdom of God the world by <transChange>it's</transChange> wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by <transChange>what they called</transChange> the folly of preaching to save those that believe.
I Corinthians 1:22 And whereas the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks look for wisdom, we preach Christ crucified;
I Corinthians 1:23 to the Jews indeed a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness; but to them that are called,
I Corinthians 1:24 both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
I Corinthians 1:25 Because the foolishness of God, <transChange>as they call it,</transChange> is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
I Corinthians 1:26 For ye see <transChange>by</transChange> your calling, brethren, that not many wise <transChange>men</transChange> according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble <transChange>are called:</transChange>
I Corinthians 1:27 but God hath chosen <transChange>things that are</transChange> foolish <transChange>in the eye</transChange> of the world to put <transChange>it's</transChange> wise men to confusion; and God hath chosen the weak <transChange>things</transChange> of the world to confound the mighty;
I Corinthians 1:28 and <transChange>things in the opinion</transChange> of the world ignoble, and despicable, and <transChange>accounted as</transChange> nothing, hath God chosen, to abolish <transChange>things</transChange> that are <transChange>in esteem among men;</transChange>
I Corinthians 1:29 that no flesh may glory in his presence.
I Corinthians 1:30 But ye are of Him in Christ Jesus, who from God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
I Corinthians 1:31 that, as it is written, He that glorieth may glory in the Lord. <chapter eID="gen5360" osisID="1Cor.1"/>
I Corinthians 2:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.2" sID="gen5392"/>
I Corinthians 2:1 And I, when I came among you, brethren, came not with excellency of language, or of <transChange>human</transChange> wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God:
I Corinthians 2:2 for I did not think <transChange>it meet</transChange> to know any thing among you, but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.
I Corinthians 2:3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
I Corinthians 2:4 And my discourse, and my preaching <transChange>was</transChange> not with the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power;
I Corinthians 2:5 that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
I Corinthians 2:6 Yet we speak <transChange>true</transChange> wisdom among the perfect: though not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought.
I Corinthians 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, <transChange>that</transChange> hidden <transChange>wisdom</transChange> which God ordained before the worlds for our glory:
I Corinthians 2:8 which none of the rulers of this age knew; for if they had known <transChange>it,</transChange> they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
I Corinthians 2:9 But as it is written, "Eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, what <transChange>things</transChange> God hath prepared for those that love Him."
I Corinthians 2:10 But God hath revealed <transChange>them</transChange> to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all <transChange>things,</transChange> even the deep <transChange>things</transChange> of God.
I Corinthians 2:11 For who among men knoweth the <transChange>things</transChange> of a man, but the spirit of a man which <transChange>is</transChange> in him? so also the things of God no one knoweth, but the Spirit of God.
I Corinthians 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit of God; that we might know the things that are graciously bestowed upon us by God:
I Corinthians 2:13 which we also speak <transChange>of,</transChange> not in words dictated by human wisdom, but in those <transChange>which are</transChange> dictated by the holy Spirit; explaining spiritual <transChange>things</transChange> by spiritual <transChange>words.</transChange>
I Corinthians 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
I Corinthians 2:15 Whereas the spiritual <transChange>man</transChange> discerneth all <transChange>things,</transChange> yet is himself discerned by no one.
I Corinthians 2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. <chapter eID="gen5392" osisID="1Cor.2"/>
I Corinthians 3:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.3" sID="gen5409"/>
I Corinthians 3:1 And I, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, could not speak to you, as to spiritual <transChange>persons,</transChange> but as to carnal <transChange>ones, even</transChange> as to babes in Christ.
I Corinthians 3:2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for ye were not hitherto able <transChange>to bear it,</transChange> nor yet are ye even now able.
I Corinthians 3:3 Because ye are still carnal: for while there is among you envy and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal, and do ye <transChange>not</transChange> walk as men?
I Corinthians 3:4 For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <transChange>am</transChange> of Apollos, are ye not carnal?
I Corinthians 3:5 Who then is Paul, and who <transChange>is</transChange> Apollos, but ministers by whose means ye embraced the faith, even as the Lord gave <transChange>success</transChange> to each <transChange>of them?</transChange>
I Corinthians 3:6 I have planted, Apollos watered: but God gave the increase.
I Corinthians 3:7 So that neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.
I Corinthians 3:8 And he that planteth, and he that watereth, are <transChange>as</transChange> one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
I Corinthians 3:9 For we are fellow-laborers, <transChange>the servants</transChange> of God: and ye are the husbandry of God, <transChange>ye are</transChange> the building of God.
I Corinthians 3:10 According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise architect I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon: but let every one see <transChange>to it</transChange> how he buildeth thereon.
I Corinthians 3:11 For no one can lay <transChange>any</transChange> other foundation, but that <transChange>which is</transChange> laid, which is Jesus Christ: and if any build upon this foundation gold,
I Corinthians 3:12 silver, precious stones, <transChange>or</transChange> wood, hay, stubble;
I Corinthians 3:13 every man's work shall be made manifest. For the <transChange>great</transChange> day will shew <transChange>it;</transChange> because it will be discovered by fire, and the fire will prove every man's work of what sort it is.
I Corinthians 3:14 If any man's work abide, which he hath built upon <transChange>it,</transChange> he shall receive a reward:
I Corinthians 3:15 <transChange>but</transChange> if any man's work be burnt, he will be damaged; though he himself shall be saved, but, as <transChange>it were</transChange> out of fire.
I Corinthians 3:16 Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
I Corinthians 3:17 If any one destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, and this temple are ye.
I Corinthians 3:18 Let no one deceive himself: if any among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be <transChange>truly</transChange> wise.
I Corinthians 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, "He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:"
I Corinthians 3:20 and again, "The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
I Corinthians 3:21 Therefore let no one glory in men: for all <transChange>things</transChange> are yours;
I Corinthians 3:22 whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or <transChange>things</transChange> present, or future, all are yours;
I Corinthians 3:23 and ye <transChange>are</transChange> Christ's; and Christ <transChange>is</transChange> God's. <chapter eID="gen5409" osisID="1Cor.3"/>
I Corinthians 4:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.4" sID="gen5433"/>
I Corinthians 4:1 Let a man so account of us, as <transChange>the</transChange> ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
I Corinthians 4:2 Now it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
I Corinthians 4:3 But to me it is of very small <transChange>moment</transChange> to be judged by you, or by <transChange>any</transChange> man's judgement; nor indeed do I judge myself:
I Corinthians 4:4 (for I am conscious to myself of nothing; though I am not hereby justified;) but He that judgeth me is the Lord.
I Corinthians 4:5 Wherefore judge nothing before the time; <transChange>even</transChange> until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden <transChange>things</transChange> of darkness, and manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every one have praise from God.
I Corinthians 4:6 These things, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, I have by a figure transferred to myself, and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us not to be wise above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up for one against another.
I Corinthians 4:7 For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou, which thou didst not receive? And if thou didst receive <transChange>it,</transChange> why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received <transChange>it?</transChange>
I Corinthians 4:8 Ye are now full, ye are now rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
I Corinthians 4:9 For it seems to me that God hath <transChange>as it were</transChange> exhibited us the apostles last <transChange>upon the stage</transChange> as appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men.
I Corinthians 4:10 We <transChange>are</transChange> fools for Christ's sake, but ye <transChange>are</transChange> wise in Christ: we <transChange>are</transChange> weak, but ye <transChange>are</transChange> strong: ye <transChange>are</transChange> honoured, but we <transChange>are</transChange> despised.
I Corinthians 4:11 Even to this present time we suffer both hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling:
I Corinthians 4:12 and we labour working with our own hands. When <transChange>we are</transChange> reviled, we bless: when persecuted, we bear <transChange>it:</transChange> when defamed, we intreat.
I Corinthians 4:13 We are made as the filth of the world, <transChange>and</transChange> the refuse of all <transChange>things</transChange> to this day.
I Corinthians 4:14 I do not write these <transChange>things</transChange> to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish <transChange>you:</transChange>
I Corinthians 4:15 for if ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <transChange>ye have</transChange> not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you by the gospel.
I Corinthians 4:16 I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
I Corinthians 4:17 For this <transChange>end</transChange> have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who will bring to your remembrance my ways in Christ, how I teach every where in every church.
I Corinthians 4:18 Now some are puffed up, as if I would not come to you.
I Corinthians 4:19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord please, and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power:
I Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God <transChange>consisteth</transChange> not in speech, but in power.
I Corinthians 4:21 What do ye chuse? that I should come to you with a rod? or in love, and <transChange>in</transChange> the spirit of meekness? <chapter eID="gen5433" osisID="1Cor.4"/>
I Corinthians 5:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.5" sID="gen5455"/>
I Corinthians 5:1 It is commonly reported <transChange>that there is</transChange> lewdness among you, and such lewdness as is not named even amongst the heathens, that one should have his father's wife.
I Corinthians 5:2 And are ye puffed up, and have not rather grieved? that he who hath committed this fact might be expelled from among you?
I Corinthians 5:3 For I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if I were present, judged him who hath wrought this <transChange>wickedness:</transChange> in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
I Corinthians 5:4 when ye are assembled together with my spirit, by the power, <transChange>I say,</transChange>
I Corinthians 5:5 of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Your boasting is not good.
I Corinthians 5:6 Do ye not know that a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass?
I Corinthians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new mass, without leaven. For our paschal lamb, even Christ, was slain for us.
I Corinthians 5:8 Wherefore let us keep the feast, not with <transChange>the</transChange> old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavening of sincerity and truth.
I Corinthians 5:9 I wrote to you in an epistle, not to associate with whoremongers:
I Corinthians 5:10 but <transChange>I did not mean</transChange> not at all with the whoremongers of this world, or the covetous, or rapacious, or idolaters: since ye must then go out of the world.
I Corinthians 5:11 But now I have written to you, not to associate with <transChange>him,</transChange> if any <transChange>one, that is</transChange> called a brother, be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or rapacious; with such a one no not to eat.
I Corinthians 5:12 For what have I to do to judge those <transChange>that are</transChange> without? <transChange>and</transChange> do not ye judge those <transChange>that are</transChange> within?
I Corinthians 5:13 But those <transChange>who are</transChange> without, God judgeth: and <transChange>therefore</transChange> put away the wicked <transChange>one</transChange> from among you. <chapter eID="gen5455" osisID="1Cor.5"/>
I Corinthians 6:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.6" sID="gen5469"/>
I Corinthians 6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter <transChange>of complaint</transChange> against another, try <transChange>it</transChange> before the unjust, and not before the saints?
I Corinthians 6:2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world <transChange>shall</transChange> be judged by you, are ye unworthy of <transChange>judging</transChange> the smallest controversies?
I Corinthians 6:3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? what! and not <transChange>worthy of judging</transChange> the affairs of <transChange>this</transChange> life?
I Corinthians 6:4 Therefore if ye have controversies about the things of <transChange>this</transChange> life, do ye set them to judge, who are despised by the church?
I Corinthians 6:5 I speak <transChange>it</transChange> to your shame. What! is there not one wise <transChange>man</transChange> among you, that is able to judge between his bretheren?
I Corinthians 6:6 But <transChange>one</transChange> brother goeth to law with <transChange>another</transChange>, and this before infidels.
I Corinthians 6:7 Now there is certainly a fault among you, that ye have law-suits with one another: why do ye not rather endure wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
I Corinthians 6:8 But ye do wrong and defraud, and that <transChange>even your</transChange> brethren.
I Corinthians 6:9 What! know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor <transChange>the</transChange> effeminate, nor sodomites, nor thieves,
I Corinthians 6:10 nor <transChange>the</transChange> covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor rapacious <transChange>persons,</transChange> shall inherit the kingdom of God.
I Corinthians 6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.
I Corinthians 6:12 All <transChange>things</transChange> are lawful for me, but all <transChange>things</transChange> are not expedient: all <transChange>things</transChange> are lawful for me, but I will not be under the power of any:
I Corinthians 6:13 meats <transChange>are</transChange> for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God will destroy both it and them. But the body <transChange>is</transChange> not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
I Corinthians 6:14 And as God hath raised up the Lord, so will He raise up us by his power.
I Corinthians 6:15 Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <transChange>them</transChange> members of an harlot?
I Corinthians 6:16 God forbid! What! know ye not that he who is joined to an harlot is one body <transChange>with her?</transChange> for the<transChange>se</transChange> two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
I Corinthians 6:17 And he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
I Corinthians 6:18 Flee from whoredom. Every <transChange>other</transChange> sin, that a man committeth, is without the body; but he, that committeth whoredom, sinneth against his own body.
I Corinthians 6:19 What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, <transChange>which is</transChange> in you, which ye have from God?
I Corinthians 6:20 and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price. Glorify God therefore in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. <chapter eID="gen5469" osisID="1Cor.6"/>
I Corinthians 7:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.7" sID="gen5490"/>
I Corinthians 7:1 Now <transChange>as to the things</transChange> concerning which ye wrote to me: <transChange>it were</transChange> good for a man not to touch a woman.
I Corinthians 7:2 Nevertheless <transChange>to prevent</transChange> whoredoms, let every <transChange>one</transChange> have his own wife, and let every <transChange>woman</transChange> have her own husband.
I Corinthians 7:3 Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence; and in like manner also the wife to the husband.
I Corinthians 7:4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and in like manner also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
I Corinthians 7:5 Do not withdraw from one another, unless by consent for a season, that ye may attend to fasting and prayer: and come together again, least Satan tempt you through your incontinency.
I Corinthians 7:6 But I say this by way of permission, not of command:
I Corinthians 7:7 for I could wish that all men were as I myself <transChange>am;</transChange> but every <transChange>man</transChange> hath his proper gift from God, one of one kind and another of another?
I Corinthians 7:8 Now to the unmarried and widows I say, it is good for them to continue <transChange>so,</transChange> as I <transChange>do.</transChange>
I Corinthians 7:9 But if they have not the gift of continence, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn <transChange>with lust.</transChange>
I Corinthians 7:10 But those that are married, not I command, but the Lord, that the wife be not separated from <transChange>her</transChange> husband;
I Corinthians 7:11 (but if she separate, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to <transChange>her</transChange> husband;) and that the husband put not away his wife.
I Corinthians 7:12 But to the rest say I, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she like to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
I Corinthians 7:13 And if any wife hath an unbelieving husband, and he like to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
I Corinthians 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband: else were your children unclean; but they are holy.
I Corinthians 7:15 But if the unbeliever depart, let them depart; a brother or a sister is not bound in such <transChange>cases.</transChange>
I Corinthians 7:16 But God hath called us to peace; for how knowest thou, O wife, but thou shalt save <transChange>thy</transChange> husband; or how knowest thou, O husband, but thou shalt save <transChange>thy</transChange> wife?
I Corinthians 7:17 However, as God hath distributed to every <transChange>man, and</transChange> as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk: and thus I order in all the churches.
I Corinthians 7:18 Is any <transChange>one</transChange> called <transChange>that is</transChange> circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: is any <transChange>one</transChange> called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised: <transChange>for</transChange> circumcision is nothing,
I Corinthians 7:19 and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God.
I Corinthians 7:20 In the calling in which every <transChange>one</transChange> was called, let him continue.
I Corinthians 7:21 Wast thou called <transChange>being</transChange> a slave, be not anxious about it; but if thou canst be <transChange>made</transChange> free, prefer it.
I Corinthians 7:22 For he that is called in the Lord <transChange>being</transChange> a slave, is the Lord's freed-man: and he likewise that is called <transChange>being</transChange> free is the servant of Christ.
I Corinthians 7:23 Ye are bought with a price, do not become the slaves of men.
I Corinthians 7:24 Brethren, in what<transChange>ever condition</transChange> every one was <transChange>when</transChange> called, let him abide therein with God.
I Corinthians 7:25 But concerning single persons I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgement as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
I Corinthians 7:26 I think then, that it is---better on account of the present distress,---that it is better, <transChange>I say,</transChange>
I Corinthians 7:27 for a <transChange>single</transChange> man to be so. Art thou bound to a wife <transChange>indeed?</transChange> seek not to be loosed: <transChange>but</transChange> art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
I Corinthians 7:28 Though, if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: such however will <transChange>probably</transChange> have <transChange>more</transChange> trouble in life: but I spare you.
I Corinthians 7:29 But this I say, brethren, that the time is short: it remains therefore, that even those, who have wives, be as though they had none;
I Corinthians 7:30 and they, that weep, as if they wept not; and they, that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they, that buy, as if they possessed not;
I Corinthians 7:31 and they, that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
I Corinthians 7:32 And I would have you without anxiety. <transChange>Now</transChange> he, that is unmarried, careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he,
I Corinthians 7:33 that is married, is in care about the things of the world, <transChange>and</transChange> how he may please <transChange>his</transChange> wife.
I Corinthians 7:34 There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin: she, that is unmarried, careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she, that is married, is in care about the things of the world, <transChange>and</transChange> how she may please <transChange>her</transChange> husband.
I Corinthians 7:35 And this I say for your own benefit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but in order to <transChange>recommend</transChange> that which is fit and becoming before the Lord without distraction.
I Corinthians 7:36 But if any <transChange>one</transChange> think that he acts unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she pass the flower of <transChange>her</transChange> age, and <transChange>that</transChange> it ought to be so, let him do what he will; he doth not sin: let them marry.
I Corinthians 7:37 But he, that is stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doth well.
I Corinthians 7:38 So that he, who giveth <transChange>her</transChange> in marriage, doth well; but he, that giveth <transChange>her</transChange> not in marriage, doth better.
I Corinthians 7:39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord:
I Corinthians 7:40 but she is happier, in my opinion, if she continue as she is: and I think I have the Spirit of God. <chapter eID="gen5490" osisID="1Cor.7"/>
I Corinthians 8:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.8" sID="gen5531"/>
I Corinthians 8:1 Now as to things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge <transChange>about them.</transChange> Knowledge <transChange>however</transChange> puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
I Corinthians 8:2 And if any <transChange>one</transChange> be conceited of his knowledge, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
I Corinthians 8:3 But if any <transChange>man</transChange> love God, he is owned by Him.
I Corinthians 8:4 As to the eating therefore of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that <transChange>there is</transChange> no other God but one.
I Corinthians 8:5 For though there be <transChange>some</transChange> that are called Gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are <transChange>among the heathen</transChange> gods many,
I Corinthians 8:6 and lords many,) yet to us <transChange>there is but</transChange> one God the Father, from whom <transChange>are</transChange> all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom <transChange>are</transChange> all things, and we by Him.
I Corinthians 8:7 But <transChange>there is</transChange> not in all <transChange>men</transChange> this knowledge: and some with a consciousness of the idol unto this day, eat <transChange>it</transChange> as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and <transChange>so</transChange> their conscience being weak is defiled.
I Corinthians 8:8 But meat does not recommend us to God; for neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor the worse, if we eat not.
I Corinthians 8:9 But see that this liberty of yours be not by any means a stumbling-block to the weak.
I Corinthians 8:10 For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak be encouraged to eat of the things sacrificed to idols?
I Corinthians 8:11 and <transChange>so</transChange> the weak brother, for whom Christ died, shall perish by thy knowledge?
I Corinthians 8:12 But <transChange>in</transChange> thus sinning against <transChange>your</transChange> brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ:
I Corinthians 8:13 wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will never eat flesh <transChange>while I breathe,</transChange> least I make my brother to offend. <chapter eID="gen5531" osisID="1Cor.8"/>
I Corinthians 9:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.9" sID="gen5545"/>
I Corinthians 9:1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? <transChange>and</transChange> are not ye my work in the Lord?
I Corinthians 9:2 If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for ye are in the Lord the seal of my apostleship.
I Corinthians 9:3 <transChange>And</transChange> this is my answer to them that call me to account: have we not power to eat and to drink?
I Corinthians 9:4 have
I Corinthians 9:5 we not power to lead about <transChange>with us</transChange> a sister a wife as well as other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
I Corinthians 9:6 Or <transChange>is it</transChange> I only and Barnabas, that have not power to forbear working?
I Corinthians 9:7 Who ever goes a warfare at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and doth not eat of the fruit of it? or who feedeth a flock, and doth not eat of the milk of the flock?
I Corinthians 9:8 Do I speak these things as a man <transChange>only?</transChange>
I Corinthians 9:9 or saith not the law the same also? for it is written in the law of Moses, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn." <transChange>Now</transChange> doth God take care for oxen,
I Corinthians 9:10 or doth He say <transChange>this</transChange> indeed for our sakes? For it is <transChange>certainly</transChange> written for our sakes, that he, who ploweth, might plow in hope; and that he, who thresheth in hope, should partake of his hope.
I Corinthians 9:11 If we <transChange>then</transChange> have sown unto you spiritual <transChange>things, is it</transChange> a great <transChange>matter</transChange> if we reap your carnal <transChange>things?</transChange>
I Corinthians 9:12 If others partake of <transChange>this</transChange> power over you, <transChange>may</transChange> not we rather? though we have not used this power; but we bear all <transChange>things,</transChange> least we should cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
I Corinthians 9:13 Do ye not know, that they who are employed about the sacrifices have their food from the temple? <transChange>and</transChange> they, who attend at the altar, are partakers with the altar?
I Corinthians 9:14 So also the Lord hath ordained, that those who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.
I Corinthians 9:15 But I have availed myself of none of these <transChange>things.</transChange> Nor have I written these <transChange>things,</transChange> that it might be so done as to me: for <transChange>it were</transChange> better for me to die, than that any <transChange>one</transChange> should make <transChange>this</transChange> my glorying void.
I Corinthians 9:16 For if I preach the gospel, <transChange>yet</transChange> I have no <transChange>ground for</transChange> boasting; because I am under necessity <transChange>to do it:</transChange> and wo is me if I do not preach the Gospel.
I Corinthians 9:17 Now if I do this willingly, I have a reward; and if unwillingly, <transChange>yet</transChange> I am intrusted with the commission, <transChange>and I must execute it.</transChange>
I Corinthians 9:18 What is my reward then <transChange>but this?</transChange> that when I preach I may make the gospel of Christ not expensive, that <transChange>so</transChange> I may not abuse my power in the gospel.
I Corinthians 9:19 For though I am free from all, <transChange>yet</transChange> I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more.
I Corinthians 9:20 And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; <transChange>that is,</transChange> to those, <transChange>who are</transChange> under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those <transChange>who are</transChange> under the law:
I Corinthians 9:21 <transChange>and</transChange> to those without the law as without the law, (not being without law to God, but under the law to Christ) that I might gain those <transChange>who are</transChange> without the law.
I Corinthians 9:22 To the weak I became as the weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that I might by every means save some.
I Corinthians 9:23 And this I do for the sake of the gospel, that I may be a fellow partaker of it.
I Corinthians 9:24 Know ye not, that those, who run in a race, do all indeed run, but one <transChange>only</transChange> receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain.
I Corinthians 9:25 And every one that enters the lists is temperate in all things: they indeed <transChange>do it</transChange> that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible <transChange>one.</transChange>
I Corinthians 9:26 I therefore so run, not as unobserved: I so fight, not as one that beateth the air:
I Corinthians 9:27 but I mortify my body and bring it into subjection, least after having preached to others, I myself should be rejected. <chapter eID="gen5545" osisID="1Cor.9"/>
I Corinthians 10:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.10" sID="gen5573"/>
I Corinthians 10:1 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
I Corinthians 10:2 and were all baptized into Moses by the cloud and by the sea;
I Corinthians 10:3 and did all eat the same spiritual food;
I Corinthians 10:4 and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and that rock was <transChange>an emblem of</transChange> Christ.
I Corinthians 10:5 But with the greater part of them God was displeased: for they were destroyed in the wilderness.
I Corinthians 10:6 Now these <transChange>things</transChange> were examples for us, that we might not lust after evil <transChange>things,</transChange> as they also lusted.
I Corinthians 10:7 And be ye not idolaters, as some of them <transChange>were;</transChange> as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play."
I Corinthians 10:8 Neither let us commit whoredom, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
I Corinthians 10:9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted <transChange>Him,</transChange> and were destroyed by serpents: nor murmur,
I Corinthians 10:10 as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
I Corinthians 10:11 Now all these <transChange>things</transChange> happened to them as examples: and are written for our admonition, on whom the last ages are come.
I Corinthians 10:12 Wherefore let him, that thinks he standeth, take heed least he fall.
I Corinthians 10:13 No temptation has <transChange>yet</transChange> taken you but <transChange>what is</transChange> common to man: and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able <transChange>to sustain;</transChange> but will with the temptation also make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear <transChange>it.</transChange>
I Corinthians 10:14 Wherefore, my beloved <transChange>brethren,</transChange> flee from idolatry.
I Corinthians 10:15 I speak <transChange>to you</transChange> as to <transChange>men</transChange> of understanding: <transChange>and</transChange> judge ye what I say,
I Corinthians 10:16 ---The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
I Corinthians 10:17 For the bread <transChange>is</transChange> one, <transChange>and</transChange> we <transChange>though</transChange> many are one body; for we all partake of <transChange>that</transChange> one bread.
I Corinthians 10:18 Consider Israel according to the flesh, Are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?
I Corinthians 10:19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that what is sacrificed to an idol is <transChange>in itself</transChange> any thing <transChange>to stumble at?</transChange>
I Corinthians 10:20 <transChange>No:</transChange> but <transChange>this I say,</transChange> that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God.
I Corinthians 10:21 And I would not have you partakers with demons. Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
I Corinthians 10:22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?
I Corinthians 10:23 <transChange>If</transChange> all things be lawful for me, yet all things are not expedient: all things <transChange>may</transChange> be lawful for me, but all things do not edify.
I Corinthians 10:24 Let no one seek his own <transChange>only,</transChange> but every one another's <transChange>benefit.</transChange>
I Corinthians 10:25 Eat <transChange>then</transChange> whatever is sold in the shambles, asking no questions for conscience sake:
I Corinthians 10:26 for the earth <transChange>is</transChange> the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:
I Corinthians 10:27 and if any of the unbelievers invite you <transChange>to an entertainment,</transChange> and ye have a mind to go, whatever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience-sake.
I Corinthians 10:28 But if any one say to you, This hath been sacrificed to an idol,---eat <transChange>it</transChange> not; for his sake who informed thee, and for conscience-sake: for, <transChange>as I said,</transChange> the earth <transChange>is</transChange> the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, <transChange>so that thou mayst have food enough without it.</transChange>
I Corinthians 10:29 Conscience I say, not thy own, but the other's; for why is my liberty <transChange>to be</transChange> judged by another <transChange>man's</transChange> conscience?
I Corinthians 10:30 And if I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for that, for which I give thanks?
I Corinthians 10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
I Corinthians 10:32 Behave inoffensively both to the Jews, and to the Greeks, and to the church of God.
I Corinthians 10:33 Even as I also <transChange>endeavour to</transChange> please all <transChange>men</transChange> in all <transChange>things,</transChange> not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved. <chapter eID="gen5573" osisID="1Cor.10"/>
I Corinthians 11:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.11" sID="gen5607"/>
I Corinthians 11:1 Be ye then imitators of me, as I also <transChange>am</transChange> of Christ.
I Corinthians 11:2 Now I commend you, brethren, that ye remember me in all <transChange>things,</transChange> and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <transChange>them</transChange> to you.
I Corinthians 11:3 But I would have you know that Christ is the head of every man; and the head of the woman <transChange>is</transChange> the man; and the head of Christ <transChange>is</transChange> God.
I Corinthians 11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having <transChange>a veil</transChange> on his head, dishonoureth <transChange>Him who is</transChange> his head.
I Corinthians 11:5 But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoureth <transChange>man</transChange> her head; for it is even all one as if she were shaved.
I Corinthians 11:6 For if a woman be not covered, she may as well be shorn: but if it be shameful to a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.
I Corinthians 11:7 For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, <transChange>he</transChange> being the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
I Corinthians 11:8 For the man was not of the woman; but the woman was <transChange>taken out</transChange> of the man:
I Corinthians 11:9 nor was the man created for the sake of the woman, but the woman for the man.
I Corinthians 11:10 For this <transChange>reason</transChange> ought the woman to have power on <transChange>her</transChange> head, because of the angels.
I Corinthians 11:11 Nevertheless, neither <transChange>is</transChange> the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
I Corinthians 11:12 For as the woman <transChange>was originally</transChange> from the man, so also <transChange>is</transChange> the man by the woman: but all <transChange>things are</transChange> from God.
I Corinthians 11:13 Judge in yourselves, Is it decent for a woman to pray to God uncovered?
I Corinthians 11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a disgrace to him?
I Corinthians 11:15 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her; because the hair was given her <transChange>as</transChange> for a veil.
I Corinthians 11:16 But if any <transChange>one</transChange> is pleased to contend <transChange>for the contrary, I answer,</transChange> We have no such custom, nor <transChange>any of</transChange> the churches of God.
I Corinthians 11:17 But whilst I am declaring this, I do not commend <transChange>you,</transChange> that ye assemble together not for the better, but for the worse.
I Corinthians 11:18 For first when ye come together in the church, I hear there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.
I Corinthians 11:19 For there must be even heresies among you, that they who are approved may be made manifest among you.
I Corinthians 11:20 When therefore ye <transChange>thus</transChange> assemble together, <transChange>this</transChange> is not eating the Lord's supper:
I Corinthians 11:21 for in eating every one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry, and another is glutted.
I Corinthians 11:22 What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink <transChange>in?</transChange> or do ye despise the church of God, and shame those that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <transChange>you</transChange> not.
I Corinthians 11:23 For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the <transChange>same</transChange> night in which He was betrayed took bread:
I Corinthians 11:24 and gave thanks, and brake <transChange>it,</transChange> and said, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"Take <transChange>and</transChange> eat; this is my body, <transChange>which is going to be</transChange> broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."</q>
I Corinthians 11:25 And in the same manner <transChange>He took</transChange> the cup, after supper, saying, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"This cup is the new covenant <transChange>ratified</transChange> in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink <transChange>of it,</transChange> in remembrance of me."</q>
I Corinthians 11:26 As often then as ye eat <transChange>of</transChange> this bread, and drink <transChange>of</transChange> this cup, ye commemorate the Lord's death till he come.
I Corinthians 11:27 So that whosoever eateth this bread, or drinketh <transChange>of</transChange> the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of <transChange>profaning</transChange> the body and blood of the Lord.
I Corinthians 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <transChange>this</transChange> bread and drink of <transChange>this</transChange> cup:
I Corinthians 11:29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgement against himself, not distinguishing the Lord's body.
I Corinthians 11:30 For this many among you <transChange>are</transChange> weak and infirm, and several are fallen asleep.
I Corinthians 11:31 If then we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged:
I Corinthians 11:32 but when judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
I Corinthians 11:33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another:
I Corinthians 11:34 and if any <transChange>one</transChange> be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together to <transChange>your</transChange> condemnation. And <transChange>as to</transChange> other <transChange>things,</transChange> I will set <transChange>them</transChange> in order when I come. <chapter eID="gen5607" osisID="1Cor.11"/>
I Corinthians 12:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.12" sID="gen5642"/>
I Corinthians 12:1 Now concerning spiritual <transChange>gifts, my</transChange> brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
I Corinthians 12:2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, drawn aside after dumb idols, <transChange>just</transChange> as ye were led: wherefore,
I Corinthians 12:3 I <transChange>must</transChange> acquaint you, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus a curse: and no one can say <transChange>that</transChange> Jesus <transChange>is the</transChange> Lord, but by the holy Ghost.
I Corinthians 12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit: and there are different offices, but the same Lord:
I Corinthians 12:5 and there are diversities of operations,
I Corinthians 12:6 but it is the same God who worketh <transChange>them</transChange> all in every one.
I Corinthians 12:7 But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the advantage <transChange>of all.</transChange>
I Corinthians 12:8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
I Corinthians 12:9 to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
I Corinthians 12:10 to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another <transChange>various</transChange> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
I Corinthians 12:11 but all these worketh that one and the same Spirit distributing to every <transChange>one</transChange> in particular as He sees fit.
I Corinthians 12:12 For as the body is one, and hath many members; but all the parts of this one body, though many, are <transChange>but</transChange> one body:
I Corinthians 12:13 so also is <transChange>the mystical body of</transChange> Christ; for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, (whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free) and are all made to drink into one Spirit:
I Corinthians 12:14 for the body is not one member, but many.
I Corinthians 12:15 If the foot should say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?
I Corinthians 12:16 And if the ear should say, "Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body?
I Corinthians 12:17 If the whole body <transChange>were an</transChange> eye, where <transChange>were</transChange> the hearing? <transChange>and</transChange> if the whole <transChange>were</transChange> hearing, where <transChange>were</transChange> the smelling?
I Corinthians 12:18 But now God hath placed the members, every one of them in the body, as He pleased.
I Corinthians 12:19 And if they were all one member, where <transChange>were</transChange> the body?
I Corinthians 12:20 whereas now <transChange>there are</transChange> many members, yet <transChange>but</transChange> one body.
I Corinthians 12:21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
I Corinthians 12:22 But <transChange>those</transChange> parts of the body, which seem to be weaker, are much more necessary:
I Corinthians 12:23 and <transChange>those</transChange> which we judge the less honorable <transChange>parts</transChange> we clothe with more abundant honor; and <transChange>so</transChange> our less comely <transChange>parts</transChange> have more comeliness <transChange>added to them,</transChange> of which our comely <transChange>ones</transChange> have no need.
I Corinthians 12:24 But God hath <transChange>so</transChange> blended <transChange>the several parts of</transChange> the body, giving greater honor to that which was deficient,
I Corinthians 12:25 that there might be no schism in the body; but that <transChange>all</transChange> the members might have the same care one for another.
I Corinthians 12:26 And so if one member suffer all the members suffer with <transChange>it;</transChange> and if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with <transChange>it.</transChange>
I Corinthians 12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and <transChange>his</transChange> members <transChange>each of you</transChange> in particular.
I Corinthians 12:28 And God hath placed <transChange>you</transChange> accordingly in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, after that <transChange>miraculous</transChange> powers, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, <transChange>and various</transChange> kinds of tongues.
I Corinthians 12:29 <transChange>Are</transChange> all apostles? <transChange>are</transChange> all prophets? <transChange>are</transChange> all teachers?
I Corinthians 12:30 <transChange>have</transChange> all <transChange>miraculous</transChange> powers? have all the gifts of healing? do all speak <transChange>many</transChange> languages? do all interpret? but ye are <transChange>all</transChange> zealous for the best gifts.
I Corinthians 12:31 Though I <transChange>will</transChange> shew you a way yet more excellent. <chapter eID="gen5642" osisID="1Cor.12"/>
I Corinthians 13:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.13" sID="gen5674"/>
I Corinthians 13:1 <transChange>For</transChange> if I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am but as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
I Corinthians 13:2 And though I have <transChange>the gift of</transChange> prophecy, and am acquainted with all mysteries, and all knowledge: yea if I have faith, <transChange>even.</transChange> to remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
I Corinthians 13:3 And though I give all my substance to feed the poor, and my body to be burnt, and have not charity, I am nothing profited.
I Corinthians 13:4 Charity beareth long, <transChange>and</transChange> is kind; charity envieth not; charity is not insolent, is not puffed up,
I Corinthians 13:5 doth not behave indecently, is not selfish, is not easily provoked,
I Corinthians 13:6 suspecteth no evil, rejoiceth not at injustice, but rejoiceth in the truth:
I Corinthians 13:7 covereth all <transChange>faults,</transChange> believeth all <transChange>things,</transChange> hopeth all <transChange>things,</transChange> endureth all <transChange>things.</transChange>
I Corinthians 13:8 Charity never faileth: but <transChange>as to</transChange> prophecies, <transChange>they</transChange> shall be abolished; or tongues, <transChange>they</transChange> shall cease; or knowledge, <transChange>it</transChange> shall be laid aside.
I Corinthians 13:9 For <transChange>now</transChange> we know <transChange>but</transChange> in part, and we prophesy <transChange>but</transChange> in part.
I Corinthians 13:10 But when that which is perfect shall come, then that which is defective shall be laid aside.
I Corinthians 13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned as a child: but when I became a man, I laid aside childish <transChange>things.</transChange>
I Corinthians 13:12 For we see now <transChange>as</transChange> through a mirror obscurely: but then <transChange>we shall see</transChange> face to face. Now I know <transChange>but</transChange> in part, but then I shall know even as I am known.
I Corinthians 13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three <transChange>graces;</transChange> but the greatest of these is love. <chapter eID="gen5674" osisID="1Cor.13"/>
I Corinthians 14:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.14" sID="gen5688"/>
I Corinthians 14:1 Labour after charity, and be desirous of spiritual <transChange>gifts:</transChange> but especially that ye may prophesy.
I Corinthians 14:2 For he, that speaketh in an <transChange>unknown</transChange> tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God: for no one understandeth, though in spirit he speaketh mysteries.
I Corinthians 14:3 But he, that prophesieth, speaketh edification, and exhortation, and comfort to men.
I Corinthians 14:4 He, that speaketh in an <transChange>unknown</transChange> tongue, edifieth himself: but he, that prophesieth, edifieth the church.
I Corinthians 14:5 I <transChange>could</transChange> wish that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater <transChange>is</transChange> he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edification.
I Corinthians 14:6 Now, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, if I come to you speaking with <transChange>many</transChange> tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak <transChange>intelligibly</transChange> to you of revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or doctrine?
I Corinthians 14:7 As inanimate <transChange>things</transChange> which give a found, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall what is piped or harped be understood?
I Corinthians 14:8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?
I Corinthians 14:9 So also unless ye utter by the tongue intelligible words, how shall what is spoken be understood? for <transChange>thus</transChange> ye will be <transChange>only</transChange> talking to the wind.
I Corinthians 14:10 There are, it may be, as many kinds of voices in the world <transChange>as people,</transChange> and none of them insignificant.
I Corinthians 14:11 But if I know not the force of the words, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh <transChange>will be</transChange> a barbarian to me.
I Corinthians 14:12 So ye also, since ye are <transChange>so</transChange> desirous of spiritual gifts, seek to abound <transChange>in them</transChange> to the edification of the church.
I Corinthians 14:13 Wherefore let him, that speaketh in an <transChange>unknown</transChange> tongue, pray that he may interpret.
I Corinthians 14:14 For if I pray in an <transChange>unknown</transChange> tongue, my spirit <transChange>indeed</transChange> prayeth, but my meaning is fruitless.
I Corinthians 14:15 What is then <transChange>to be done?</transChange> I will pray with the Spirit, but I will pray to be understood: I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing to be understood.
I Corinthians 14:16 For if thou bless in the spirit, how shall the unlearned say Amen to thy thanksgiving, when he knoweth not what thou sayst?
I Corinthians 14:17 thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
I Corinthians 14:18 I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all.
I Corinthians 14:19 But in a <transChange>public</transChange> assembly I had rather speak five words to be understood, that I may instruct others also, than ten thousand words in an <transChange>unknown</transChange> tongue.
I Corinthians 14:20 <transChange>My</transChange> brethren, be not children in sense: but in malice be infants, and in <transChange>your</transChange> judgements <transChange>shew yourselves to</transChange> be <transChange>men.</transChange>
I Corinthians 14:21 It is written in the law, "By men of another language, and by other lips, will I speak to this people, and even so they will not listen to me, saith the Lord."
I Corinthians 14:22 So that tongues are for a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers: but prophecy not to unbelievers but to those that believe.
I Corinthians 14:23 If then the whole church be come together and all speak in <transChange>unknown</transChange> tongues, and there come in illiterate <transChange>persons,</transChange> or infidels, will they not say that ye are mad?
I Corinthians 14:24 But if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or <transChange>one</transChange> unlearned, he is convinced by all, he is judged by all.
I Corinthians 14:25 And thus the secrets of his heart are made manifest; so that falling down upon <transChange>his</transChange> face he will worship God, declaring that God is indeed among you.
I Corinthians 14:26 What is then <transChange>to be done, my</transChange> brethren? when ye come together, <transChange>if</transChange> any of you hath a psalm, a doctrine, a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation,---let all be done for edification.
I Corinthians 14:27 And if any <transChange>one</transChange> speak in an <transChange>unknown</transChange> tongue, <transChange>let it be</transChange> by two, or at most <transChange>by</transChange> three, and <transChange>that</transChange> by turns; and let one interpret.
I Corinthians 14:28 But if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the assembly; and let him speak to himself and to God.
I Corinthians 14:29 And let <transChange>but</transChange> two or three <transChange>of the</transChange> prophets speak, and the others judge.
I Corinthians 14:30 And if any thing be revealed to another sitting by, let the first have done speaking <transChange>before the other begins.</transChange>
I Corinthians 14:31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
I Corinthians 14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets:
I Corinthians 14:33 for God is not <transChange>the author</transChange> of confusion, but of peace, <transChange>as we see</transChange> in all the assemblies of the saints.
I Corinthians 14:34 Let your women be silent in <transChange>your</transChange> assemblies: for it is not permitted to them to speak, but <transChange>they are</transChange> to be in subjection, as the law saith.
I Corinthians 14:35 And if they would learn any <transChange>thing,</transChange> let them ask their own husbands at home; for it does not become women to speak in a <transChange>public</transChange> assembly.
I Corinthians 14:36 Did the word of God come out <transChange>first</transChange> from you? or did it come to you only?
I Corinthians 14:37 If any one seem to be a prophet, or acted by the Spirit, let him acknowlege that what I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
I Corinthians 14:38 But if any <transChange>will</transChange> be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
I Corinthians 14:39 Wherefore, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, be <transChange>most</transChange> desirous to prophesy, and <transChange>yet</transChange> forbid not to speak with tongues:
I Corinthians 14:40 <transChange>but</transChange> let all things be done decently and in order. <chapter eID="gen5688" osisID="1Cor.14"/>
I Corinthians 15:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.15" sID="gen5729"/>
I Corinthians 15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached to you <transChange>at first,</transChange> which ye received, and wherein ye stand.
I Corinthians 15:2 By which also ye are saved, if ye retain <transChange>it</transChange> as I preached <transChange>it</transChange> to you: unless indeed ye have believed in vain.
I Corinthians 15:3 For in the first <transChange>place</transChange> I delivered to you, that which I also received, <transChange>to wit,</transChange> that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:
I Corinthians 15:4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the scriptures.
I Corinthians 15:5 And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:
I Corinthians 15:6 after that He appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain yet <transChange>alive,</transChange> but some are fallen asleep.
I Corinthians 15:7 Afterwards He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.
I Corinthians 15:8 And last of all He appeared to me also, as one born out of due time: for I am the lest of the apostles,
I Corinthians 15:9 not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
I Corinthians 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his favor to me was not <transChange>in</transChange> vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
I Corinthians 15:11 Whether therefore I or they <transChange>laboured most,</transChange> thus we preach, and thus ye believed.
I Corinthians 15:12 Now if it be preached that Christ is risen from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?
I Corinthians 15:13 for if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen.
I Corinthians 15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then <transChange>is</transChange> our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
I Corinthians 15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses concerning God, for we have testified of God, that He raised up Christ; whom He did not raise up, if indeed the dead do not rise.
I Corinthians 15:16 For if the dead rise not, then Christ is not raised:
I Corinthians 15:17 and if Christ be not risen, your faith <transChange>is</transChange> vain; ye are yet in your sins.
I Corinthians 15:18 Then they also that sleep in Christ, are perished.
I Corinthians 15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
I Corinthians 15:20 But now Christ is risen from the dead, <transChange>and</transChange> is become the first-fruits of them that slept:
I Corinthians 15:21 for as by man <transChange>came</transChange> death, by man <transChange>cometh</transChange> also the resurrection of the dead.
I Corinthians 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
I Corinthians 15:23 But each in <transChange>their</transChange> proper order: the first-fruits, Christ; afterwards they that are Christ's, at his coming.
I Corinthians 15:24 Then <transChange>will be</transChange> the end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when He shall have abolished all rule, and all authority, and power.
I Corinthians 15:25 For he must reign till <transChange>He</transChange> hath put all <transChange>his</transChange> enemies under his feet.
I Corinthians 15:26 The last enemy <transChange>that</transChange> is destroyed <transChange>is</transChange> death:
I Corinthians 15:27 for <transChange>He</transChange> hath put all <transChange>things</transChange> under his feet. But when He saith that all <transChange>things</transChange> are put under <transChange>Him, it is</transChange> plain that <transChange>we are to</transChange> except Him who put all <transChange>things</transChange> under Him.
I Corinthians 15:28 And when all <transChange>things</transChange> shall be subjected to Him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to Him, that put all <transChange>things</transChange> under Him, that God may be all in all.
I Corinthians 15:29 Besides, what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why then are they baptized for the dead?
I Corinthians 15:30 And why are we in danger every hour?
I Corinthians 15:31 I protest by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, <transChange>that</transChange> I am <transChange>even</transChange> dying daily.
I Corinthians 15:32 If, to speak as a man, I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage have I, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. ---
I Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived, bad conversations corrupt good morals.
I Corinthians 15:34 Behave soberly, as ye ought to do, and sin not: for some <transChange>of you</transChange> have not the knowledge of God; to your shame I speak <transChange>it.</transChange>
I Corinthians 15:35 But some will say, How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?
I Corinthians 15:36 Silly <transChange>creature!</transChange> that which thou sowest, is not quickened, except it die <transChange>first.</transChange>
I Corinthians 15:37 And <transChange>as to</transChange> what thou sowest, thou sowest not the <transChange>very</transChange> body that shall be <transChange>produced,</transChange> but a bare grain, it may be, of wheat, or any other <transChange>corn:</transChange>
I Corinthians 15:38 and God giveth it a body as He pleaseth, and to every one of the seeds it's own body.
I Corinthians 15:39 All flesh <transChange>is</transChange> not the same <transChange>kind of</transChange> flesh: but <transChange>there is</transChange> one flesh of men, and another of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
I Corinthians 15:40 <transChange>There are</transChange> also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but there <transChange>is</transChange> one glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.
I Corinthians 15:41 <transChange>There is</transChange> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: and <transChange>one</transChange> star differeth from <transChange>another</transChange> star in glory.
I Corinthians 15:42 So also <transChange>will be</transChange> the resurrection of the dead. <transChange>Our body</transChange> is sown in corruption, it is raised incorruptible: it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory:
I Corinthians 15:43 it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
I Corinthians 15:44 it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body: <transChange>for</transChange> there is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.
I Corinthians 15:45 And so it is written, "The first man Adam was made a living soul." <transChange>But</transChange> the last Adam <transChange>is</transChange> an enlivening spirit.
I Corinthians 15:46 However, the spiritual <transChange>is</transChange> not first, but the animal; <transChange>and</transChange> afterwards the spiritual.
I Corinthians 15:47 The first man <transChange>being made</transChange> out of the earth, <transChange>was</transChange> earthy: the second man <transChange>is</transChange> the Lord from heaven.
I Corinthians 15:48 <transChange>Such</transChange> as the earthy <transChange>was,</transChange> such <transChange>are</transChange> they also that are earthy: and such, as <transChange>is</transChange> the heavenly, <transChange>are</transChange> they also that are heavenly.
I Corinthians 15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
I Corinthians 15:50 But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor doth what is corruptible inherit incorruption.
I Corinthians 15:51 Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall not all sleep; but we shall all be changed in a moment,
I Corinthians 15:52 in the twinkling of an eye, at <transChange>the sound of</transChange> the last trumpet (for the trumpet shall sound) and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed:
I Corinthians 15:53 for this corruptible <transChange>body</transChange> must put on incorruption, and this mortal <transChange>body</transChange> must be clothed with immortality.
I Corinthians 15:54 And when this corruptible shall be clothed with incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word <transChange>that is</transChange> written, "Death is swallowed up in victory."
I Corinthians 15:55 O death, where <transChange>is</transChange> thy sting? O grave, where <transChange>is</transChange> thy victory?
I Corinthians 15:56 the sting of death <transChange>is</transChange> sin; and the strength of sin <transChange>is</transChange> the law:
I Corinthians 15:57 but thanks <transChange>be</transChange> to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
I Corinthians 15:58 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, since ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. <chapter eID="gen5729" osisID="1Cor.15"/>
I Corinthians 16:0 <chapter osisID="1Cor.16" sID="gen5788"/>
I Corinthians 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
I Corinthians 16:2 Upon the first <transChange>day</transChange> of the week let every one of you set apart <transChange>something,</transChange> putting <transChange>it</transChange> into the treasury, according as he is prospered: that there may be no <transChange>need of</transChange> collections, when I come.
I Corinthians 16:3 And when I am with <transChange>you,</transChange> whomsoever ye shall approve, I will send, with <transChange>your</transChange> letters, to carry your bounty to Jerusalem.
I Corinthians 16:4 And if it be requisite for me to go also, they shall go with me.
I Corinthians 16:5 I will come to you, when I have passed through Macedonia; for I am to pass through Macedonia.
I Corinthians 16:6 And perhaps I shall stay <transChange>a while,</transChange> or even pass the winter with you; that ye may forward me on my journey, whithersoever I go.
I Corinthians 16:7 For I do not intend to see you now in <transChange>my</transChange> way, as I hope to stay some time with you, if the Lord permit.
I Corinthians 16:8 But I shall stay at Ephesus till Pentecost. For a great and effectual door is opened to me,
I Corinthians 16:9 though <transChange>there are</transChange> many opposers.
I Corinthians 16:10 If Timothy should come, see that he be with you without fear: for he is employed in the work of the Lord, as I also <transChange>am.</transChange>
I Corinthians 16:11 Let no one therefore despise him: but forward him <transChange>on his journey</transChange> in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren. As to <transChange>our</transChange> brother Apollos,
I Corinthians 16:12 I much importuned him to come to you with the brethren: but he was not at all willing to come now; though he will come when he has a favorable opportunity.
I Corinthians 16:13 Be watchful, stand fast in the faith, behave like men, be strong:
I Corinthians 16:14 <transChange>and</transChange> let all your affairs be <transChange>carried on</transChange> in love.
I Corinthians 16:15 I beseech you, brethren, (<transChange>for</transChange> ye know the family of Stephanas, that they are the first-fruits of Achaia, and
I Corinthians 16:16 have <transChange>set</transChange> themselves to minister to the saints) that you also would be subservient to such, and to every one that worketh and laboureth with <transChange>us.</transChange>
I Corinthians 16:17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus: for what was wanting in you, they have made up.
I Corinthians 16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit as well as yours: have a <transChange>due</transChange> regard therefore to such <transChange>worthy persons.</transChange>
I Corinthians 16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church in their house, salute you in the Lord <transChange>with</transChange> much <transChange>affection:</transChange>
I Corinthians 16:20 <transChange>yea</transChange> all the brethren salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss.
I Corinthians 16:21 The salutation of <transChange>me</transChange> Paul <transChange>I write</transChange> with my own hand.
I Corinthians 16:22 If any <transChange>one</transChange> love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be <transChange>made</transChange> a curse.
I Corinthians 16:23 Maran-atha. The grace of <transChange>our</transChange> Lord Jesus Christ <transChange>be</transChange> with you.
I Corinthians 16:24 My love <transChange>be</transChange> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. <chapter eID="gen5788" osisID="1Cor.16"/> <div eID="gen5359" osisID="1Cor" type="book"/>

II Corinthians 1:1 <hi type="bold">Paul</hi> an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy <transChange>our</transChange> brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, and all the saints that are in Achaia:
II Corinthians 1:2 grace <transChange>be</transChange> to you, and peace from God our Father, and <transChange>from</transChange> the Lord Jesus Christ.
II Corinthians 1:3 Blessed <transChange>be</transChange> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation; who comforteth us in all our affliction,
II Corinthians 1:4 that we may be able to comfort those, <transChange>that are</transChange> in any trouble, by the consolation wherewith we ourselves are comforted by God.
II Corinthians 1:5 For as the sufferings <transChange>for the sake</transChange> of Christ abound on us, so our consolation by Christ doth also abound.
II Corinthians 1:6 And whether we be afflicted, <transChange>it is</transChange> for your consolation and salvation, which is wrought out by the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or if we be comforted, <transChange>it is</transChange> for your consolation and salvation.
II Corinthians 1:7 And our hope <transChange>is</transChange> firm concerning you, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the consolation.
II Corinthians 1:8 For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befel us in Asia, that we were exceedingly pressed above <transChange>our</transChange> strength, so that we despaired even of life:
II Corinthians 1:9 but we had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:
II Corinthians 1:10 who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver, in whom we trust that He will yet deliver <transChange>us:</transChange>
II Corinthians 1:11 you also assisting by prayer for us, that the favor <transChange>obtained</transChange> for us by <transChange>the prayers of</transChange> many might be thankfully acknowledged by many on our account.
II Corinthians 1:12 For this is our rejoicing, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and pious sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and especially towards you.
II Corinthians 1:13 For we write no other <transChange>things</transChange> to you, but what ye own and acknowledge, and I hope ye will always acknowledge.
II Corinthians 1:14 As ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, as ye also <transChange>are</transChange> ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
II Corinthians 1:15 And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you first, (that ye might have a second benefit,) and to pass by you into Macedonia;
II Corinthians 1:16 and <transChange>then</transChange> to come to you again from Macedonia, and by you to be forwarded <transChange>on my way</transChange> to Judea.
II Corinthians 1:17 Now when I intended this, was I chargeable with levity? or what I purpose, do I purpose from carnal motives, that with me there should be yea, yea, and <transChange>then</transChange> no, no?
II Corinthians 1:18 But the faithful God, <transChange>He knows,</transChange> that our word to you was not yes and no.
II Corinthians 1:19 For Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, <transChange>even</transChange> by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yea and nay,
II Corinthians 1:20 but was yea in Him, (for all the promises of God are in Him yea, and in Him amen,) to the glory of God by us:
II Corinthians 1:21 but He that establisheth us as well as you in Christ, and hath anointed us, <transChange>is</transChange> God; who hath also sealed us,
II Corinthians 1:22 and given <transChange>us</transChange> the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
II Corinthians 1:23 But I call God to witness on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth:
II Corinthians 1:24 not that we are lords over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. <chapter eID="gen5814" osisID="2Cor.1"/>
II Corinthians 2:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.2" sID="gen5839"/>
II Corinthians 2:1 But I determined with myself, not to come to you again in grief:
II Corinthians 2:2 for if I grieve you, who is it that maketh me glad, but he that is grieved by me?
II Corinthians 2:3 And I wrote this to you, that when I come I may not have grief from those of whom I ought to receive joy, being persuaded concerning all <transChange>of</transChange> you, that my joy is <transChange>the joy</transChange> of you all.
II Corinthians 2:4 For through much affliction and distress of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye might be grieved, but that ye might know the love with which I abound towards you.
II Corinthians 2:5 And if any <transChange>one</transChange> hath caused grief, it hath grieved me only as to part <transChange>of you,</transChange> (that I may not overcharge you
II Corinthians 2:6 all) <transChange>though</transChange> sufficient to such a one is the censure <transChange>passed on him</transChange> by many.
II Corinthians 2:7 So that on the contrary, ye <transChange>ought</transChange> rather to forgive and comfort <transChange>him,</transChange> least such a one should be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.
II Corinthians 2:8 Wherefore I beseech you to confirm <transChange>your</transChange> love to him.
II Corinthians 2:9 For to this <transChange>end</transChange> also did I write, that I might have proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all <transChange>things.</transChange>
II Corinthians 2:10 And to whom ye forgive any thing, I also <transChange>forgive it:</transChange> for if I have forgiven any thing, <transChange>I forgave it him,</transChange> to whom I did forgive <transChange>it,</transChange> for your sakes, in the person of Christ; that we might not be foiled by Satan:
II Corinthians 2:11 for we are not ignorant of his devices.
II Corinthians 2:12 So that when I came to Troas on account of the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
II Corinthians 2:13 <transChange>yet</transChange> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother <transChange>there;</transChange> but taking my leave of them, I went away into Macedonia.
II Corinthians 2:14 But thanks <transChange>be</transChange> to God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and spreadeth the odor of his knowledge by us in every place.
II Corinthians 2:15 For we are the sweet odor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, <transChange>yea</transChange> and in them that perish:
II Corinthians 2:16 to these indeed <transChange>we are</transChange> an odor of death to death; to those an odor of life unto life. And who <transChange>is</transChange> sufficient for these <transChange>things?</transChange>
II Corinthians 2:17 For we are not like many who adulterate the word of God: but as with sincerity, but as from God, <transChange>and</transChange> in the sight of God, we speak concerning Christ. <chapter eID="gen5839" osisID="2Cor.2"/>
II Corinthians 3:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.3" sID="gen5857"/>
II Corinthians 3:1 Do we begin again to recommend ourselves? or do we need, as some <transChange>do,</transChange> recommendatory epistles to you, or <transChange>letters of</transChange> recommendation from you?
II Corinthians 3:2 Ye are our epistle, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all men:
II Corinthians 3:3 being manifest that ye are the epistle of Christ, through our ministration, written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on tables of the heart of flesh.
II Corinthians 3:4 And such confidence have we through Christ towards God:
II Corinthians 3:5 not that we can of ourselves reckon upon any <transChange>thing</transChange> as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.
II Corinthians 3:6 Who hath also fitted us <transChange>to be</transChange> ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.
II Corinthians 3:7 Now if the ministration of death <transChange>which was</transChange> in writing, <transChange>and</transChange> engraven on stones, was so glorious that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly on the face of Moses, because of the lustre of his countenance, which was to be taken away:
II Corinthians 3:8 shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious?
II Corinthians 3:9 For if the ministration of condemnation <transChange>was</transChange> <transChange>so</transChange> glorious, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory:
II Corinthians 3:10 since what was <transChange>then</transChange> made glorious was not in comparison glorious, because of the glory that surpasseth <transChange>it.</transChange>
II Corinthians 3:11 For if that, which was <transChange>to be</transChange> taken away, <transChange>came</transChange> with glory, much more that which abideth <transChange>is</transChange> glorious.
II Corinthians 3:12 Having therefore such hope, we use much freedom of speech:
II Corinthians 3:13 and <transChange>do</transChange> not as Moses, <transChange>who</transChange> put a veil upon his face, <transChange>intimating</transChange> that the children of Israel could not look to the end of that which was to be abolished; but their minds were blinded:
II Corinthians 3:14 for unto this day the same veil remaineth unremoved in the reading of the old testament, which <transChange>veil</transChange> is taken away in Christ.
II Corinthians 3:15 But to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.
II Corinthians 3:16 Though when <transChange>it</transChange> turneth unto the Lord, the veil is taken off:
II Corinthians 3:17 now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord <transChange>is,</transChange> there <transChange>is</transChange> liberty.
II Corinthians 3:18 But we all with unveiled face beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are transformed <transChange>according to</transChange> the same image from glory to glory, as <transChange>proceeding</transChange> from the Spirit of the Lord. <chapter eID="gen5857" osisID="2Cor.3"/>
II Corinthians 4:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.4" sID="gen5876"/>
II Corinthians 4:1 Therefore having <transChange>received</transChange> this ministry, as we have obtained mercy, we are not disheartened:
II Corinthians 4:2 but have rejected shameful disguises, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth, recommending ourselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of God.
II Corinthians 4:3 And if our gospel also be veiled, it is to those that perish;
II Corinthians 4:4 among whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, doth not shine unto them:
II Corinthians 4:5 for we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus <transChange>the</transChange> Lord, and ourselves your servants for the sake of Jesus.
II Corinthians 4:6 For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to <transChange>reflect</transChange> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
II Corinthians 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power might be <transChange>evidently</transChange> of God, and not of us:
II Corinthians 4:8 being afflicted on every <transChange>side,</transChange> but not oppressed; perplexed, but not in despair;
II Corinthians 4:9 persecuted, but not forsaken;
II Corinthians 4:10 cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.
II Corinthians 4:11 For we, who are <transChange>yet</transChange> living, are always exposed to death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
II Corinthians 4:12 So that death is wrought in us, but life in you.
II Corinthians 4:13 But having the same Spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I believed, and therefore have I spoken," we also believe, and therefore speak:
II Corinthians 4:14 knowing that He, who raised up the Lord Jesus, will raise up us also by Jesus, and present <transChange>us</transChange> with you.
II Corinthians 4:15 For all <transChange>these things are</transChange> for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the gratitude of many redound to the glory of God.
II Corinthians 4:16 For which cause we are not disheartened: but though our outward man decayeth, yet the inward man is renewed daily.
II Corinthians 4:17 For our short <transChange>and</transChange> light affliction is working out for us an infinite <transChange>and</transChange> eternal weight of glory, as we aim not at the things <transChange>which are</transChange> visible, but invisible:
II Corinthians 4:18 for those, which are visible, <transChange>are</transChange> temporary, but the invisible <transChange>are</transChange> eternal. <chapter eID="gen5876" osisID="2Cor.4"/>
II Corinthians 5:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.5" sID="gen5895"/>
II Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house, <transChange>which is but as</transChange> a tent, were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
II Corinthians 5:2 And therefore <transChange>whilst we are</transChange> in this <transChange>tabernacle</transChange> we groan, being very desirous to be covered with our house <transChange>which is</transChange> from heaven: since though unclothed <transChange>of this body,</transChange>
II Corinthians 5:3 <transChange>yet</transChange> we shall not be found naked.
II Corinthians 5:4 For we who are in <transChange>this</transChange> tabernacle do groan, being burthened; wherefore we desire, not to be <transChange>wholly</transChange> unclothed, but to put on <transChange>immortality,</transChange> that the mortal <transChange>part</transChange> may be swallowed up in life.
II Corinthians 5:5 Now He, that hath wrought us hereunto, <transChange>is</transChange> God; who hath also given us the earnest of the Spirit.
II Corinthians 5:6 Therefore <transChange>we are</transChange> always confident, knowing that while we dwell in the body, we are absent from the Lord,
II Corinthians 5:7 (for we walk by faith, not by sight,) we are confident, <transChange>I say,</transChange>
II Corinthians 5:8 and well-pleased rather to be absent from the body, and to dwell with the Lord.
II Corinthians 5:9 Wherefore we are also ambitious, whether dwelling in <transChange>the body,</transChange> or out <transChange>of it,</transChange> to be well-pleasing to Him.
II Corinthians 5:10 For we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, that every <transChange>one</transChange> may receive <transChange>for</transChange> the things <transChange>done</transChange> in the body, according to what he hath done, whether <transChange>it were</transChange> good or bad.
II Corinthians 5:11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men: but <transChange>if not,</transChange> we are manifest unto God, and I hope we are also manifested to your consciences:
II Corinthians 5:12 for we are not again recommending ourselves to you, but giving you an occasion of glorying on our account; that ye may have <transChange>somewhat to answer</transChange> those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
II Corinthians 5:13 For whether we be in extasies, <transChange>it is</transChange> to God: or if we be composed, it is for your benefit.
II Corinthians 5:14 For the love of Christ constraineth us, being <transChange>fully</transChange> persuaded of this, that if One died for all, then were all dead.
II Corinthians 5:15 And He died for all, that those who live might no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose again.
II Corinthians 5:16 Wherefore we henceforth know no one according to the flesh: and if we have known even Christ after the flesh, yet now we <transChange>thus</transChange> know Him no more.
II Corinthians 5:17 And therefore if any <transChange>one be</transChange> in Christ, <transChange>he is</transChange> created anew: old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.
II Corinthians 5:18 But all <transChange>these</transChange> things <transChange>are</transChange> from God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and made us ministers of the reconciliation;
II Corinthians 5:19 <transChange>to declare,</transChange> that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing to them their trespasses, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
II Corinthians 5:20 We are therefore ambassadors for Christ, <transChange>and</transChange> as God exhorteth <transChange>you</transChange> by us, we intreat you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
II Corinthians 5:21 For He hath made Him, who knew no sin, <transChange>to be</transChange> a sin-<transChange>offering</transChange> for us, that in Him we might be made righteous before God. <chapter eID="gen5895" osisID="2Cor.5"/>
II Corinthians 6:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.6" sID="gen5917"/>
II Corinthians 6:1 And we co-operating <transChange>with Him</transChange> do also exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:
II Corinthians 6:2 for He saith, "I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee." Behold now <transChange>is</transChange> the acceptable time; behold now <transChange>is</transChange> the day of salvation.
II Corinthians 6:3 We give no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
II Corinthians 6:4 but in every thing approving ourselves as the ministers of God; by much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,
II Corinthians 6:5 in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
II Corinthians 6:6 by purity, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the holy Spirit,
II Corinthians 6:7 by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, with the armour of righteousness <transChange>on the</transChange> right and <transChange>on the</transChange> left; through honor and dishonor,
II Corinthians 6:8 through evil report and good report;
II Corinthians 6:9 as deceivers, and <transChange>yet</transChange> true; as unknown, and <transChange>yet</transChange> well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, but not put to death;
II Corinthians 6:10 as sorrowing, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all <transChange>things.</transChange>
II Corinthians 6:11 O Corinthians, our mouth is opened unto you, our heart is enlarged:
II Corinthians 6:12 ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
II Corinthians 6:13 Now as a return of <transChange>our love</transChange> (I speak as to <transChange>my</transChange> children) be ye also enlarged <transChange>towards us.</transChange>
II Corinthians 6:14 Be not unsuitably connected with infidels: for what fellowship <transChange>hath</transChange> righteousness with unrighteousness? or what communion <transChange>hath</transChange> light with darkness?
II Corinthians 6:15 what concord <transChange>hath</transChange> Christ with Belial? or what part <transChange>hath</transChange> a believer with an infidel?
II Corinthians 6:16 and what agreement <transChange>hath</transChange> the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God: as God hath said, "I will dwell in them, and I will walk among <transChange>them,</transChange> and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
II Corinthians 6:17 Wherefore, "come out from the midst of them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing," and I will receive you:
II Corinthians 6:18 and I will be a father unto you, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. <chapter eID="gen5917" osisID="2Cor.6"/>
II Corinthians 7:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.7" sID="gen5936"/>
II Corinthians 7:1 Having therefore, <transChange>my</transChange> beloved, these promises, let us purify ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
II Corinthians 7:2 Receive us---we have injured no man, we have corrupted no one, we have over-reached no one.
II Corinthians 7:3 I speak not <transChange>this</transChange> to condemn <transChange>you:</transChange> for I said before that ye are <transChange>so much</transChange> in our hearts that we could live and die with <transChange>you.</transChange>
II Corinthians 7:4 I <transChange>use</transChange> much freedom of speech to you, <transChange>and</transChange> I boast much of you: I am filled with comfort, <transChange>and</transChange> superabound in joy above all our affliction.
II Corinthians 7:5 For when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but <transChange>we were</transChange> afflicted on every <transChange>side;</transChange> without <transChange>were</transChange> fightings, within <transChange>were</transChange> fears.
II Corinthians 7:6 But God, who comforteth those that are brought low, comforted us by the coming of Titus:
II Corinthians 7:7 and not only by his coming, but especially by the consolation wherewith he was comforted on your account, acquainting us with your earnest desire <transChange>towards us,</transChange> your grief, <transChange>and</transChange> your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced greatly.
II Corinthians 7:8 For though I grieved you by <transChange>my</transChange> letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that that epistle grieved you, though <transChange>it was</transChange> but for a <transChange>little</transChange> while.
II Corinthians 7:9 <transChange>However,</transChange> now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were grieved after a godly manner, so that ye received no damage from us.
II Corinthians 7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
II Corinthians 7:11 For behold this very <transChange>thing,</transChange> that ye sorrowed after a godly manner, what diligence it wrought in you! yea, <transChange>what</transChange> apology, <transChange>what</transChange> indignation, <transChange>what</transChange> fear, <transChange>what</transChange> earnest desire, <transChange>what</transChange> zeal, <transChange>what</transChange> revenge! by all <transChange>which</transChange> ye have shewn yourselves to be clear in the affair.
II Corinthians 7:12 Wherefore if I wrote <transChange>in such a manner</transChange> to you, <transChange>it was</transChange> not <transChange>merely</transChange> on his account who had done the wrong, nor for his sake who had been injured; but that our care for you in the sight of God might be manifested among you.
II Corinthians 7:13 We were therefore comforted by your consolation; and rejoiced the more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all;
II Corinthians 7:14 <transChange>and</transChange> because if I boasted of any thing to him concerning you, I was not ashamed; but as we have spoken all <transChange>things</transChange> to you in truth, so likewise our boasting <transChange>of you</transChange> to Titus was truth.
II Corinthians 7:15 And his bowels are exceedingly <transChange>moved</transChange> towards you, when he calls to mind the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
II Corinthians 7:16 I rejoice therefore that in every <transChange>thing</transChange> I have confidence in you. <chapter eID="gen5936" osisID="2Cor.7"/>
II Corinthians 8:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.8" sID="gen5953"/>
II Corinthians 8:1 Now we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God conferred on the churches of Macedonia:
II Corinthians 8:2 how in a great trial of affliction, their abundant chearfulness and their deep poverty, hath munificently shewn the riches of their bounty.
II Corinthians 8:3 For to <transChange>their</transChange> power, I bear <transChange>them</transChange> witness, yea and beyond <transChange>their</transChange> power, <transChange>they contributed</transChange> of their own accord:
II Corinthians 8:4 intreating us with much importunity, that we would convey the gift, and <transChange>so take upon us</transChange> a part of the ministration to the saints.
II Corinthians 8:5 And <transChange>this they did</transChange> not <transChange>merely</transChange> as we hoped, but first gave themselves unto the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
II Corinthians 8:6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had already begun, so he would also complete this grace among you.
II Corinthians 8:7 And as ye abound in every <transChange>other grace, in</transChange> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <transChange>in</transChange> all diligence, and <transChange>in</transChange> your love to us, that ye may abound in this grace also.
II Corinthians 8:8 I speak not by way of command, but to prove the sincerity of your love also, by <transChange>means of</transChange> the forwardness of others.
II Corinthians 8:9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, <transChange>yet</transChange> for your sakes He became poor, that ye by his poverty might be rich.
II Corinthians 8:10 And herein I give my opinion: for this is to your advantage, who not only began to act, but also to be forward <transChange>to it</transChange> above a year ago.
II Corinthians 8:11 Now therefore perfect also the doing it; that as <transChange>there was</transChange> a readiness of will, so <transChange>there may be</transChange> also a performance according to your ability.
II Corinthians 8:12 For if there be first a willing mind, any <transChange>me</transChange> is accepted according to what he hath, not according to what he hath not.
II Corinthians 8:13 For <transChange>I do</transChange> not <transChange>mean</transChange> that others should <transChange>have</transChange> relief, and you be burdened:
II Corinthians 8:14 but by an equality, that your abundance <transChange>may</transChange> at this time <transChange>be a supply</transChange> to their want; and their abundance may be <transChange>the like</transChange> to your want, <transChange>if need be:</transChange> that there may be an equality:
II Corinthians 8:15 as it is written, "He that <transChange>gathered</transChange> much had nothing over, and he that <transChange>gathered</transChange> little had no lack."
II Corinthians 8:16 But thanks <transChange>be</transChange> to God, who put the same concern for you into the heart of Titus:
II Corinthians 8:17 for he not only complied with the exhortation, but being more forward he went to you of his own accord.
II Corinthians 8:18 And we have sent along with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel <transChange>is spread</transChange> through all the churches:
II Corinthians 8:19 (and not only <transChange>so,</transChange> but he was also chosen by the churches to accompany us with this grace, <transChange>which is</transChange> administered by us for the glory of the same Lord, and <transChange>to shew</transChange> your readiness of mind:)
II Corinthians 8:20 <transChange>hereby</transChange> taking care that no one might blame us in <transChange>the disposal of</transChange> this large sum which is administered by us:
II Corinthians 8:21 looking to things <transChange>that are</transChange> right not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
II Corinthians 8:22 And we have sent with them <transChange>another</transChange> brother of ours, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, and now <transChange>I doubt not</transChange> much more on account of <transChange>his</transChange> great confidence in you.
II Corinthians 8:23 If then <transChange>there be any inquiry</transChange> about Titus, <transChange>he is</transChange> my collegue and fellow-laborer among you: and if our brethren <transChange>be inquired after, they are</transChange> the messengers of the churches, <transChange>and</transChange> the glory of Christ.
II Corinthians 8:24 Therefore shew to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and <transChange>the justness</transChange> of our boasting concerning you. <chapter eID="gen5953" osisID="2Cor.8"/>
II Corinthians 9:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.9" sID="gen5978"/>
II Corinthians 9:1 Now concerning the relief <transChange>intended</transChange> for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
II Corinthians 9:2 for I know your readiness of mind, which I boast of concerning you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath excited many.
II Corinthians 9:3 But I have sent the brethren, that our boasting of you might not become vain in this respect, <transChange>but</transChange> that ye might be ready, as I <transChange>had</transChange> said:
II Corinthians 9:4 least if the Macedonians should come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed (not to say you <transChange>also</transChange>) in this confident boasting.
II Corinthians 9:5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go first to you, and before <transChange>our coming to</transChange> collect your bounty beforementioned, that it may be ready, as <transChange>of</transChange> munificence, and not <transChange>of</transChange> force.
II Corinthians 9:6 But this <transChange>I say,</transChange> He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall also reap bountifully.
II Corinthians 9:7 <transChange>Let</transChange> every one <transChange>give</transChange> as he chuses in <transChange>his own</transChange> heart; not with reluctance, or constraint: for God loveth a chearful giver.
II Corinthians 9:8 And God <transChange>is</transChange> able to make all grace abound towards you; that having always all sufficiency in every thing, ye may abound in every good work:
II Corinthians 9:9 (as it is written, "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness continueth for ever."
II Corinthians 9:10 And may He, who supplieth seed to the sower, and <transChange>giveth</transChange> bread for food, furnish and multiply your sowing, and increase the fruits of your bounty:)
II Corinthians 9:11 being in every <transChange>thing</transChange> enriched to all liberality, which produceth through us thanksgiving to God.
II Corinthians 9:12 For the ministration of this service not only supplieth the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also, through many thanksgivings, to <transChange>the glory of</transChange> God.
II Corinthians 9:13 (While from the experience of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and the liberality of your communication to them, and to all <transChange>men.</transChange>)
II Corinthians 9:14 And in their prayer for you, who long after you because of the transcendent grace of God towards you.
II Corinthians 9:15 Thanks <transChange>be</transChange> to God for his inexpressible gift! <chapter eID="gen5978" osisID="2Cor.9"/>
II Corinthians 10:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.10" sID="gen5994"/>
II Corinthians 10:1 Now I Paul myself exhort you, by the meekness and lenity of Christ, who in presence am lowly among you,
II Corinthians 10:2 but being absent am bold towards you, yea I intreat you, that I may not be bold, when I am present, with <transChange>that</transChange> confidence, wherewith I think to proceed against some, who censure us as walking after the flesh.
II Corinthians 10:3 For though we are in the flesh, we do not carry on our war according to the flesh:
II Corinthians 10:4 (for the weapons of our warfare <transChange>are</transChange> not carnal, but mighty through God to the demolishing of bulwarks:)
II Corinthians 10:5 destroying <transChange>false</transChange> reasonings, and every height that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and captivating every thought to the obedience of Christ.
II Corinthians 10:6 And being prepared to avenge all disobedience, since your obedience is fulfilled.
II Corinthians 10:7 Do ye look at things according to the outward appearance? If any <transChange>one</transChange> is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again of himself, that as he <transChange>is</transChange> Christ's, so we also <transChange>are</transChange> Christ's.
II Corinthians 10:8 For though I should boast yet more of our authority, (which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction) I should not be ashamed:
II Corinthians 10:9 that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters;
II Corinthians 10:10 for <transChange>his</transChange> letters, say they, <transChange>are</transChange> weighty and powerful, but <transChange>his</transChange> bodily presence <transChange>is</transChange> weak, and <transChange>his</transChange> speech contemptible.
II Corinthians 10:11 <transChange>But</transChange> let such a one know this, that as we are in word by letters, when absent, such also <transChange>shall we be</transChange> in fact when present.
II Corinthians 10:12 For we presume not to number, or compare ourselves with some who recommend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are void of understanding.
II Corinthians 10:13 But we will not glory of things beyond <transChange>our</transChange> bounds, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath given to us, a measure to come even unto you.
II Corinthians 10:14 For we do not stretch ourselves beyond <transChange>measure,</transChange> as though we were not <transChange>commissioned</transChange> to come unto you; for we have reached even to you also in <transChange>preaching</transChange> the gospel of Christ.
II Corinthians 10:15 Not boasting of things beyond <transChange>our</transChange> limits in other men's labors; but having hope that, when your faith is increased, we shall be abundantly enlarged by you according to our line,
II Corinthians 10:16 to preach the gospel in <transChange>places</transChange> beyond you; <transChange>and</transChange> not to boast in another's province of things ready <transChange>prepared for us.</transChange>
II Corinthians 10:17 But let him, that glorieth, glory in the Lord.
II Corinthians 10:18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but <transChange>he</transChange> whom the Lord commendeth. <chapter eID="gen5994" osisID="2Cor.10"/>
II Corinthians 11:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.11" sID="gen6013"/>
II Corinthians 11:1 I wish ye would bear with me a little in <transChange>my</transChange> folly; and indeed bear with me.
II Corinthians 11:2 For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, having espoused you to one husband, that I may present <transChange>you as</transChange> a chaste virgin to Christ.
II Corinthians 11:3 But I fear least as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the purity that is in Christ.
II Corinthians 11:4 For if he, that cometh <transChange>to you,</transChange> preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached; or <transChange>if</transChange> ye receive another Spirit which ye have not received, or another gospel which ye have not embraced, ye might indeed bear with <transChange>him.</transChange>
II Corinthians 11:5 For I think I was not inferior to the <transChange>very</transChange> chiefest apostles: and if <transChange>I am</transChange> unskilled in speech,
II Corinthians 11:6 yet not in knowledge ---but we have been fully manifested among you in all things.
II Corinthians 11:7 Have I committed an offence <transChange>in</transChange> humbling myself that ye might be exalted? <transChange>and in</transChange> that I have preached the gospel of God to you gratis?
II Corinthians 11:8 I trespassed on other churches, receiving maintenance <transChange>from them</transChange> for your service.
II Corinthians 11:9 And when I was present among you, and in want, I was chargeable to no one. For the brethren that came from Macedonia supplied my want: and in every <transChange>thing</transChange> I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and <transChange>so</transChange> I will keep <transChange>myself.</transChange>
II Corinthians 11:10 <transChange>As</transChange> the truth of Christ is in me, this boast shall not be taken from me in the regions of Achaia.
II Corinthians 11:11 Wherefore? because I love you not?
II Corinthians 11:12 God knoweth. But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off occasion from those that desire an occasion <transChange>of boasting or censure,</transChange> that in what they boast of they may be found <transChange>to do</transChange> even as we <transChange>do.</transChange>
II Corinthians 11:13 For such <transChange>are</transChange> false apostles, deceitful workers, transformed into apostles of Christ.
II Corinthians 11:14 And no wonder: for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
II Corinthians 11:15 <transChange>It is</transChange> therefore no great <transChange>thing,</transChange> if his ministers also be transformed into ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
II Corinthians 11:16 I say again, let no one think me foolish <transChange>herein;</transChange> but if they do, yet bear with my weakness, that I also may boast a little.
II Corinthians 11:17 What I speak I speak not <transChange>as</transChange> from the Lord, but as in weakness, in this confidence of boasting.
II Corinthians 11:18 Since many boast in the flesh, I will boast also.
II Corinthians 11:19 For ye bear with fools willingly, being <transChange>yourselves so</transChange> wise:
II Corinthians 11:20 ye bear <transChange>it, even</transChange> if any <transChange>one</transChange> enslave you, if any devour <transChange>you,</transChange> if any take <transChange>your substance,</transChange> if any be lifted up, <transChange>yea</transChange> if any one smite you on the face.
II Corinthians 11:21 I speak of <transChange>their</transChange> reproach<transChange>es,</transChange> as if we were weak: but whereinsoever any one may be confident (<transChange>though</transChange> I speak foolishly) I may be confident too.
II Corinthians 11:22 Are they Hebrews? so <transChange>am</transChange> I: are they Israelites? so <transChange>am</transChange> I: are they the seed of Abraham?
II Corinthians 11:23 so <transChange>am</transChange> I: are they ministers of Christ? (<transChange>if</transChange> I <transChange>may</transChange> speak as a fool) I <transChange>am</transChange> more: in labors more abundant, in stripes far exceeding, in prisons more frequently, <transChange>and</transChange> often <transChange>even</transChange> in deaths.
II Corinthians 11:24 From the Jews I have five times received forty <transChange>stripes</transChange> save one.
II Corinthians 11:25 Thrice I have been beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I have been shipwrecked, <transChange>and</transChange> was a night and a day on the deep:
II Corinthians 11:26 in journies often, in perils from rivers, in perils from robbers, in perils from <transChange>my own</transChange> nation, in perils from the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the desert, in perils on the sea, in perils among false brethren:
II Corinthians 11:27 in labor and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness: <transChange>and</transChange> beside <transChange>these</transChange> outward <transChange>troubles,</transChange>
II Corinthians 11:28 that which besets me daily, the care of all the churches.
II Corinthians 11:29 Who is infirm, and I am not infirm <transChange>also?</transChange> who is offended, and I am not inflamed?
II Corinthians 11:30 If I must boast, I will boast of the <transChange>things</transChange> which relate to my infirmity.
II Corinthians 11:31 <transChange>And</transChange> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lye not.
II Corinthians 11:32 In Damascus the governor under king Aretas, placed guards about the city to seize me:
II Corinthians 11:33 and I was let down by the wall through a window in a basket, and <transChange>so</transChange> escaped his hands. <chapter eID="gen6013" osisID="2Cor.11"/>
II Corinthians 12:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.12" sID="gen6047"/>
II Corinthians 12:1 To boast indeed does not become me: but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
II Corinthians 12:2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth) such a one caught up to the third heaven.
II Corinthians 12:3 And I know such a man (whether <transChange>then</transChange> in the body, or out of the body,
II Corinthians 12:4 I know not, God knoweth) that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unutterable words, which it is not permitted unto man to speak.
II Corinthians 12:5 Of such a one I will boast; but of myself I will not boast, unless in my infirmities.
II Corinthians 12:6 For though I should incline to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I should speak truth. But I forbear least any <transChange>one</transChange> should think of me above what he seeth me <transChange>to be,</transChange> or heareth from me.
II Corinthians 12:7 And least I should be too much lifted up with the abundance of the revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, least I should be too much elevated.
II Corinthians 12:8 For this I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
II Corinthians 12:9 And He said unto me, <q marker="" who="Jesus">"My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is manifested in <transChange>thy</transChange> weakness."</q> With the greatest pleasure therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
II Corinthians 12:10 And therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, <transChange>and</transChange> in straits for the sake of Christ: for when I am <transChange>thus</transChange> weak, then am I <transChange>made</transChange> strong.
II Corinthians 12:11 Am I become vain <transChange>in</transChange> boasting? ye have forced me <transChange>to it:</transChange> for I ought to have been recommended by you, as I have in nothing fallen short of the very chiefest <transChange>of the</transChange> apostles, though <transChange>in myself</transChange> I am nothing.
II Corinthians 12:12 The marks indeed of an apostle have been shewn among you with all patience, by signs, and wonders, and miracles.
II Corinthians 12:13 For what is it that ye were inferior <transChange>in</transChange> to the rest of the churches, unless <transChange>it be</transChange> that I myself was not burdensome to you?--- Forgive me this injury.
II Corinthians 12:14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your <transChange>substance,</transChange> but your <transChange>selves.</transChange> For children are not <transChange>expected</transChange> to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
II Corinthians 12:15 And I will with the greatest pleasure spend and be spent for your souls; even though the more I love you, the less I <transChange>should</transChange> be loved.
II Corinthians 12:16 Be it <transChange>so, that</transChange> I did not burden you <transChange>myself,</transChange> yet, <transChange>may some say,</transChange> being crafty I over-reached you by subtilty.
II Corinthians 12:17 <transChange>But</transChange> did I make a gain of you by any of those whom I sent to you?
II Corinthians 12:18 I desired Titus <transChange>to come to you,</transChange> and with <transChange>him</transChange> I sent a brother: did Titus make a gain of you? did we not walk in the same spirit? <transChange>did we</transChange> not <transChange>tread</transChange> in the same steps?
II Corinthians 12:19 Do ye then think that we are making apologies to you? <transChange>No,</transChange> we speak before God in Christ: and all, <transChange>my</transChange> beloved, for your edification.
II Corinthians 12:20 For I am afraid least when I come, I should not find you such as I <transChange>could</transChange> wish, and I should be found to you such as ye would not: least <transChange>there should be</transChange> contentions, emulations, animosities, strifes, thwartings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: <transChange>and</transChange> least,
II Corinthians 12:21 when I come again, my God should humble me among you, and I should be grieved for many of those who have sinned heretofore, and have not repented of the impurity, and fornication, and lewdness which they have practised. <chapter eID="gen6047" osisID="2Cor.12"/>
II Corinthians 13:0 <chapter osisID="2Cor.13" sID="gen6069"/>
II Corinthians 13:1 This, <transChange>I say, is the</transChange> third <transChange>time</transChange> I am coming to you: <transChange>and</transChange> at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
II Corinthians 13:2 I said before, and I <transChange>again</transChange> tell you beforehand, as if I were present the second <transChange>time;</transChange> and being absent I now write to those who have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare:
II Corinthians 13:3 since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful among you.
II Corinthians 13:4 For if He was crucified <transChange>as</transChange> from weakness, yet He <transChange>now</transChange> liveth by the power of God: for we also are weak in Him, but shall live with Him by the power of God <transChange>manifested</transChange> to you.
II Corinthians 13:5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove yourselves: do ye not know yourselves <transChange>to be such</transChange> that Jesus Christ is in you? unless ye are reprovable.
II Corinthians 13:6 But I hope ye will <transChange>soon</transChange> know that we are not disapproved.
II Corinthians 13:7 I pray to God that ye may do no evil: <transChange>and</transChange> not that we may appear <transChange>to be</transChange> approved <transChange>by your punishment,</transChange> but that ye may do that which is good, though we should seem to be disapproved.
II Corinthians 13:8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
II Corinthians 13:9 For we rejoice when we exert not our power, and <transChange>when</transChange> ye are strong: as this <transChange>is what</transChange> we wish, <transChange>even</transChange> your perfection.
II Corinthians 13:10 Therefore I write these <transChange>things</transChange> while absent, that when present I may not use severity, according to the power which the Lord hath given me for edification, and not for destruction.
II Corinthians 13:11 Finally, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, farewel: be reformed, be exhorted, be of one mind, live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.
II Corinthians 13:12 Salute one another with an holy kiss.
II Corinthians 13:13 All the saints salute you. <transChange>May</transChange> the favor of the Lord Jesus Christ,
II Corinthians 13:14 and the love of God, and the communication of the Holy Spirit <transChange>be</transChange> with you all. Amen. <chapter eID="gen6069" osisID="2Cor.13"/> <div eID="gen5813" osisID="2Cor" type="book"/>

Galatians 1:1 <hi type="bold">Paul</hi> an apostle (not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),
Galatians 1:2 and all the brethren <transChange>that are</transChange> with me, to the churches of Galatia:
Galatians 1:3 grace <transChange>be</transChange> to you and peace from God the Father, and <transChange>from</transChange> our Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians 1:4 who gave himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:
Galatians 1:5 to whom <transChange>be</transChange> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Galatians 1:6 I wonder that ye are so soon removed from him who called you by the grace of Christ to another gospel: which is not another;
Galatians 1:7 but there be some that disturb you, and would subvert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians 1:8 But tho' we or an angel from heaven should preach to you <transChange>any</transChange> other <transChange>gospel</transChange> than what we have preached to you; let him be accursed.
Galatians 1:9 I say <transChange>it</transChange> again, if any <transChange>one</transChange> preach to you <transChange>any</transChange> other <transChange>gospel</transChange> than what ye have received, let him be accursed.
Galatians 1:10 For do I now persuade <transChange>you to obey</transChange> men or God? Or do I seek to please men? if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
Galatians 1:11 But I assure you, brethren, that the gospel preached by me is not <transChange>of</transChange> human <transChange>invention.</transChange>
Galatians 1:12 For I neither received it, nor was taught it by man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians 1:13 For ye have heard of my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I outragiously persecuted the church of God, and laid it waste:
Galatians 1:14 and I made a proficiency in Judaism above many of the same age <transChange>with me</transChange> in my own nation, being excessively zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians 1:15 But when it pleased God, (who separated me from my mother's womb, and called <transChange>me</transChange> by his grace,)
Galatians 1:16 to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach Him among the gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,
Galatians 1:17 nor went I up to Jerusalem to those that were apostles before me, but I departed into Arabia, and <transChange>afterwards</transChange> returned again to Damascus.
Galatians 1:18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I staid with him fifteen days.
Galatians 1:19 But I saw no other of the apostles, except James the brother of <transChange>our</transChange> Lord.
Galatians 1:20 (Now <transChange>in</transChange> what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.)
Galatians 1:21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,
Galatians 1:22 and was not known in person to the churches of Judea, <transChange>which were</transChange> in Christ.
Galatians 1:23 But only they had heard that he who persecuted us before, now preacheth the faith which he formerly <transChange>would have</transChange> destroyed.
Galatians 1:24 And they glorified God on my account. <chapter eID="gen6085" osisID="Gal.1"/>
Galatians 2:0 <chapter osisID="Gal.2" sID="gen6110"/>
Galatians 2:1 Fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus also with <transChange>me.</transChange>
Galatians 2:2 But I went up according to <transChange>a divine</transChange> revelation, and laid before them the gospel which I preach among the gentiles: though privately to those of note, least I should run, or had run in vain.
Galatians 2:3 But even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised;
Galatians 2:4 and <transChange>that</transChange> because of the false brethren clandestinely introduced, who had crept in as spies upon our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
Galatians 2:5 to whom we yielded no submission, <transChange>not</transChange> even for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
Galatians 2:6 And as to those who seemed to be <transChange>men</transChange> of note, whatever they were, it is all one to me, (God accepteth no man's person) for <transChange>even</transChange> these eminent <transChange>persons</transChange> added nothing more to me.
Galatians 2:7 But on the contrary, seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of uncircumcision, as Peter <transChange>was with that</transChange> of the circumcision;
Galatians 2:8 (for He who wrought effectually in Peter as to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought effectually also in me as to the gentiles:)
Galatians 2:9 and knowing the grace <transChange>which was</transChange> given to me; James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars <transChange>of the church,</transChange> gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we <transChange>should go</transChange> to the gentiles, and they to the circumcision.
Galatians 2:10 Only <transChange>desiring</transChange> that we would remember the poor: which I also was forward to do.
Galatians 2:11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was <transChange>indeed</transChange> to be blamed.
Galatians 2:12 For before certain <transChange>men</transChange> came from James, he did eat with the gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.
Galatians 2:13 And the rest of the Jews dissembled also with him; so that Barnabas too was carried away with their dissimulation.
Galatians 2:14 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <transChange>them</transChange> all,---If thou, who art a Jew, livest <transChange>sometimes</transChange> after the manner of the gentiles, and not like the Jews, why dost thou <transChange>now in a manner</transChange> compel the gentiles to judaize?
Galatians 2:15 We, <transChange>who are</transChange> Jews by birth, and not sinners of the gentiles,
Galatians 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by <transChange>the</transChange> works of <transChange>the</transChange> law: for by <transChange>the</transChange> works of <transChange>the</transChange> law shall no flesh be justified.
Galatians 2:17 But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <transChange>is</transChange> Christ therefore the minister of sin?
Galatians 2:18 God forbid. And if I build again the same <transChange>things</transChange> which I demolished, I shew myself a transgressor: for I through the law am dead to the law,
Galatians 2:19 that I might live unto God.
Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ; yet I live, <transChange>though</transChange> no longer I, but Christ liveth in me: and <transChange>the life</transChange> which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave up himself for me.
Galatians 2:21 I do not frustate the grace of God: for if righteousness <transChange>be</transChange> by the law, then Christ died in vain. <chapter eID="gen6110" osisID="Gal.2"/>
Galatians 3:0 <chapter osisID="Gal.3" sID="gen6132"/>
Galatians 3:1 O senseless Galatians, who hath <transChange>so</transChange> bewitched you, that <transChange>ye</transChange> should not obey the truth? <transChange>you,</transChange> before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth <transChange>as</transChange> crucified.
Galatians 3:2 This only would I learn of you, Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians 3:3 Are ye so void of understanding? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
Galatians 3:4 have ye suffered so many <transChange>things</transChange> in vain? if indeed in vain.
Galatians 3:5 He therefore that imparteth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, <transChange>doth he it</transChange> by the works of the law, or by the doctrine of faith?
Galatians 3:6 As Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness:
Galatians 3:7 so ye know that they who believe, are the children of Abraham.
Galatians 3:8 And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the gentiles through faith, preached the gospel to Abraham long ago, <transChange>saying,</transChange> "In thee shall all nations be blessed."
Galatians 3:9 So then they that believe, are blessed with believing Abraham.
Galatians 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed <transChange>be</transChange> every one that continueth not in all <transChange>things which are</transChange> written in the book of the law, to do them.
Galatians 3:11 And that by the law no one is justified before God <transChange>is</transChange> evident; for <transChange>it is</transChange> <transChange>written</transChange> "The just shall live by faith:"
Galatians 3:12 now the law is not of faith, but <transChange>saith,</transChange> "The man that doth them, shall live in them."
Galatians 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been made a curse for us: for it is written, "Cursed <transChange>is</transChange> every one that hangeth on a tree:"
Galatians 3:14 that the blessing of Abraham might come on the gentiles by Christ Jesus; that we through faith might receive the promise of the Spirit.
Galatians 3:15 Brethren, (I speak after the manner of men,) no one cancelleth or addeth to a covenant <transChange>which hath been</transChange> ratified, though <transChange>it be but the covenant</transChange> of a man.
Galatians 3:16 Now the promises were made to Abraham, and to his seed. He doth not say, "and to seeds," as of many; but as of one, "and to thy seed," which is Christ.
Galatians 3:17 This then I say, <transChange>that</transChange> the law, which was <transChange>given</transChange> four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul the covenant, which was <transChange>so long</transChange> before confirmed by God unto Christ, to make void the promise.
Galatians 3:18 For if the inheritance be from the law, <transChange>it is</transChange> no more from <transChange>the</transChange> promise: whereas God gave <transChange>it</transChange> to Abraham by promise.
Galatians 3:19 What then <transChange>availeth</transChange> the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; <transChange>and it was</transChange> delivered by angels in the hand of a mediator.
Galatians 3:20 Now a mediator is not <transChange>the mediator</transChange> of one <transChange>only;</transChange> and God is <transChange>but</transChange> one.
Galatians 3:21 <transChange>Is</transChange> the law then contrary to the promises of God? not at all: for if a law had been given, which could have confered life, certainly righteousness would have been by the law.
Galatians 3:22 But the scripture hath shut up all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
Galatians 3:23 But before faith came, we were kept shut up under the law, till the faith <transChange>appeared</transChange> which was to be revealed.
Galatians 3:24 So that the law was our guide <transChange>to lead us</transChange> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Galatians 3:25 But now faith is come we are no longer under a pedagogue.
Galatians 3:26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ:
Galatians 3:28 <transChange>and</transChange> there is neither Jew nor Greek, those is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
Galatians 3:29 And if ye <transChange>be</transChange> Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. <chapter eID="gen6132" osisID="Gal.3"/>
Galatians 4:0 <chapter osisID="Gal.4" sID="gen6162"/>
Galatians 4:1 Now as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he <transChange>is to</transChange> be lord of all:
Galatians 4:2 but is under guardians and managers till the time appointed by the father.
Galatians 4:3 So we when we were children, were in servitude under the elements of the world:
Galatians 4:4 but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son born of a woman made under the law,
Galatians 4:5 that He might redeem those <transChange>that were</transChange> under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
Galatians 4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Galatians 4:7 So that thou art no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, an heir also of God through Christ.
Galatians 4:8 But then indeed, when ye knew not God, ye served those which in reality are no gods.
Galatians 4:9 But now that ye know God, or rather are known by God, how <transChange>is it that</transChange> ye turn again to the poor weak elements, to which ye desire again to be in bondage as before?
Galatians 4:10 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years:
Galatians 4:11 <transChange>so that</transChange> I am afraid for you, least I have indeed bestowed upon you labour in vain.
Galatians 4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I <transChange>am;</transChange> for I also <transChange>was</transChange> as ye <transChange>are: and</transChange> ye have not injured me at all.
Galatians 4:13 But ye know that in the infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at first:
Galatians 4:14 and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected <transChange>me for it;</transChange> but received me as an angel of God, <transChange>even</transChange> as Christ Jesus.
Galatians 4:15 What then was your blessedness? for I bear you witness that, if <transChange>it had been</transChange> possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
Galatians 4:16 And am I become your enemy <transChange>for</transChange> telling you the truth?
Galatians 4:17 They are zealous for you, <transChange>but</transChange> not as they ought: for they would exclude us, that ye may be zealous for them:
Galatians 4:18 But <transChange>it is</transChange> good to be zealously affected always in that which is good, and not only when I am present with you.
Galatians 4:19 My little children, of whom I do <transChange>as it were</transChange> travail in birth again,
Galatians 4:20 till Christ be formed in you, I should be glad to be present with you <transChange>even</transChange> now, and to change my voice; for I am in doubt about you.
Galatians 4:21 Tell me, you that are <transChange>so</transChange> desirous to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
Galatians 4:22 where it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by a servant, and one by a free-<transChange>woman?</transChange>
Galatians 4:23 But he <transChange>who was</transChange> of the servant, was born according to the course of nature; whereas the <transChange>son</transChange> of the free-<transChange>woman was</transChange> by <transChange>virtue of</transChange> the promise.
Galatians 4:24 Which <transChange>things</transChange> are figurative; for these <transChange>persons</transChange> are <transChange>emblems of</transChange> the two covenants, <transChange>the</transChange> one from mount Sinai, bringing forth <transChange>children</transChange> unto bondage, which is Hagar: for this <transChange>name</transChange> Hagar,
Galatians 4:25 <transChange>a rock,</transChange> is <transChange>expressive of</transChange> mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children.
Galatians 4:26 But the Jerusalem above is <transChange>represented by the</transChange> free-<transChange>woman,</transChange> which is the mother of us all.
Galatians 4:27 For it is written, Rejoice thou barren, that <transChange>for a while</transChange> didst not bear, break <transChange>forth</transChange> and cry aloud <transChange>for joy,</transChange> thou that didst not travail with child; for many more <transChange>are</transChange> the children of the desolate than of her that hath an husband."
Galatians 4:28 Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of <transChange>the</transChange> promise.
Galatians 4:29 But as then he that was born after the flesh, persecuted him <transChange>who was born</transChange> after the Spirit, even so <transChange>it is</transChange> now.
Galatians 4:30 But what saith the scripture? "Cast out the servant and her son: for the son of the servant shall not inherit with the son of the free-<transChange>woman.</transChange>"
Galatians 4:31 Now we, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, are not children of the servant, but of the free-<transChange>woman.</transChange> <chapter eID="gen6162" osisID="Gal.4"/>
Galatians 5:0 <chapter osisID="Gal.5" sID="gen6194"/>
Galatians 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage.
Galatians 5:2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.
Galatians 5:3 And I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to the whole law.
Galatians 5:4 Christ is become nothing to you, whosoever <transChange>of you</transChange> are <transChange>seeking to be</transChange> justified by the law: ye are fallen from the grace <transChange>of the gospel.</transChange>
Galatians 5:5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
Galatians 5:6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.
Galatians 5:7 Ye did run well: who hindered you from obeying the truth?
Galatians 5:8 This persuasion <transChange>came</transChange> not from him that called you: <transChange>but</transChange> a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass.
Galatians 5:9 I have confidence in you <transChange>however</transChange> through the Lord,
Galatians 5:10 that ye will not think other<transChange>wise:</transChange> but he that troubleth you shall bear <transChange>his</transChange> judgement, whosoever he be.
Galatians 5:11 And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted <transChange>by the Jews? for</transChange> then the offence of the cross is ceased.
Galatians 5:12 I wish they were even cut off <transChange>from your communion,</transChange> that make <transChange>such</transChange> disturbance amongst you.
Galatians 5:13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only <transChange>abuse</transChange> not this liberty for an occasion to <transChange>indulge</transChange> the flesh, but by <transChange>mutual</transChange> love serve one another.
Galatians 5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one precept, <transChange>even</transChange> in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Galatians 5:15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not destroyed by one another.
Galatians 5:16 I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfil the desire of the flesh:
Galatians 5:17 for the flesh desireth <transChange>things</transChange> contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit <transChange>things</transChange> contrary to the flesh: and these are opposite to each other; so that ye do not those <transChange>things</transChange> which ye would.
Galatians 5:18 But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, such as, adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
Galatians 5:20 lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strifes, emulations, animosities, contentions, divisions,
Galatians 5:21 heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and the like: of which I forewarn you, as I have also told you before, that they who practise such <transChange>things</transChange> shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
Galatians 5:23 gentleness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, temperance: against such <transChange>things</transChange> there is no law.
Galatians 5:24 And they, that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with <transChange>it's</transChange> passions and desires.
Galatians 5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Galatians 5:26 Let us not be vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another. <chapter eID="gen6194" osisID="Gal.5"/>
Galatians 6:0 <chapter osisID="Gal.6" sID="gen6221"/>
Galatians 6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault, do ye, who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, least thou also shouldst be tempted.
Galatians 6:2 Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
Galatians 6:3 For if any one thinketh <transChange>that</transChange> he is something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
Galatians 6:4 But let every one try his own work, and then he will have <transChange>matter of</transChange> glorying in himself alone, and not in another.
Galatians 6:5 For every one shall bear his own burthen.
Galatians 6:6 And let him, that is instructed in the word, communicate in all good things to him that instructeth.
Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived, God is not <transChange>to be</transChange> mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
Galatians 6:8 He then, who soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he, that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Galatians 6:9 And let us not be weary <transChange>in</transChange> doing good: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Galatians 6:10 And therefore as we have opportunity, let us do good to all <transChange>men,</transChange> but especially to those who are of the houshold of faith.
Galatians 6:11 Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand.
Galatians 6:12 They, who want to make a fair appearance in the flesh, <transChange>would</transChange> constrain you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians 6:13 For they, who are circumcised, do not themselves keep the law: but they would have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
Galatians 6:14 But God forbid that I should glory, unless in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
Galatians 6:15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but being created anew.
Galatians 6:16 And as many as shall walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be on them, even upon <transChange>all</transChange> the Israel of God.
Galatians 6:17 For the future, let no one give me uneasiness: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
Galatians 6:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <transChange>be</transChange> with your spirit, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren. Amen. <chapter eID="gen6221" osisID="Gal.6"/> <div eID="gen6084" osisID="Gal" type="book"/>

Ephesians 1:10 that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, He might reduce all <transChange>things,</transChange> both in heaven and on earth, under one head in Christ:
Ephesians 1:11 <transChange>even</transChange> in Him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated <transChange>to it</transChange> according to the purpose of Him who effecteth all <transChange>things</transChange> after the counsel of His own will:
Ephesians 1:12 that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
Ephesians 1:13 In whom ye also <transChange>trusted,</transChange> when ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also when ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise,
Ephesians 1:14 who is the pledge of our inheritance, till the redemption of his purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.
Ephesians 1:15 Wherefore I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
Ephesians 1:16 and <transChange>your</transChange> love to all the saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
Ephesians 1:17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation to the knowledge of Him,
Ephesians 1:18 <transChange>and</transChange> enlighten the eyes of your understanding; that ye may know, what is the hope of his calling, and how rich the glory of his inheritance in the saints;
Ephesians 1:19 and what the exceeding greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the energy of his mighty strength;
Ephesians 1:20 which He exerted in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at his own right hand in heavenly <transChange>places,</transChange>
Ephesians 1:21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that <transChange>which is</transChange> to come:
Ephesians 1:22 and hath put all <transChange>things</transChange> under his feet, and given Him <transChange>to be</transChange> head over all <transChange>things</transChange> to the church;
Ephesians 1:23 which is his body, the complete work of Him, who filleth all in all. <chapter eID="gen6241" osisID="Eph.1"/>
Ephesians 2:0 <chapter osisID="Eph.2" sID="gen6265"/>
Ephesians 2:1 And you <transChange>hath he made alive</transChange> who were dead in trespasses and sins,
Ephesians 2:2 in which ye formerly walked after the manner of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that still operates in the children of disobedience:
Ephesians 2:3 among whom also we were all conversant heretofore in our carnal desires, indulging the appetites of the flesh and of <transChange>our</transChange> imaginations; and were by nature children of wrath, even as others.
Ephesians 2:4 But God being rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith He loved us,
Ephesians 2:5 hath made us alive in Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses, (<transChange>for</transChange> by grace ye are saved) and hath raised <transChange>us</transChange> up together,
Ephesians 2:6 and made <transChange>us</transChange> sit together in heavenly <transChange>places</transChange> in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians 2:7 That in the ages to come He might shew the superabundant riches of his grace, in <transChange>his</transChange> kindness towards us through Christ Jesus.
Ephesians 2:8 For by grace ye are saved, through faith: and this not of yourselves; <transChange>it is</transChange> the gift of God: not by works, that no one may boast:
Ephesians 2:9 for we are his workmanship,
Ephesians 2:10 created in Christ Jesus unto good works, for which God before prepared <transChange>us,</transChange> that we might walk in them.
Ephesians 2:11 Wherefore remember that ye <transChange>were</transChange> formerly Gentiles in the flesh, called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision made by hands in the flesh;
Ephesians 2:12 <transChange>and</transChange> ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: but now in Christ Jesus,
Ephesians 2:13 ye, who were formerly afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians 2:14 For He is our peace, who hath made both one, and removed the wall of partition <transChange>from</transChange> between <transChange>us;</transChange>
Ephesians 2:15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity, <transChange>even</transChange> the law of commandments <transChange>contained</transChange> in ordinances, that He might form the two into one new man, in Himself, <transChange>so</transChange> making peace;
Ephesians 2:16 and that He might reconcile both in one body unto God, by the cross, having thereby slain the enmity:
Ephesians 2:17 and He came and preached peace to you <transChange>that were</transChange> afar off, and to them <transChange>that were</transChange> nigh.
Ephesians 2:18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians 2:19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the houshold of God;
Ephesians 2:20 being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-<transChange>stone:</transChange>
Ephesians 2:21 in whom the whole building fitly joined together increaseth to an holy temple in the Lord:
Ephesians 2:22 in whom ye also are built up together for an habitation of God by the Spirit. <chapter eID="gen6265" osisID="Eph.2"/>

Ephesians 3:1 For this cause I Paul <transChange>am</transChange> the prisoner of Jesus Christ for the sake of you Gentiles:
Ephesians 3:2 as ye have heard the dispensation of the grace of God, which was given me <transChange>to preach</transChange> unto you:
Ephesians 3:3 that by <transChange>immediate</transChange> revelation He made known to me the mystery, (as I wrote before in brief, by which,
Ephesians 3:4 when ye read <transChange>it,</transChange> ye may perceive my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,)
Ephesians 3:5 which in other generations was not made known to men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; that the Gentiles should be co-heirs,
Ephesians 3:6 and of the same body, and joint-partakers of his promise in Christ, by the gospel:
Ephesians 3:7 of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God conferred on me by the effectual operation of his power.
Ephesians 3:8 On me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace bestowed, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
Ephesians 3:9 and make all <transChange>men</transChange> to see the communication of the mystery, which from the ages <transChange>past</transChange> hath been hid in God, who created all <transChange>things</transChange> by Jesus Christ;
Ephesians 3:10 that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly <transChange>regions;</transChange>
Ephesians 3:11 according to the ancient purpose, which He executed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Ephesians 3:12 by whom we have freedom and access with confidence through faith in Him.
Ephesians 3:13 Wherefore I desire that ye would not be discouraged at my afflictions on your account, which is your glory.
Ephesians 3:14 For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Ephesians 3:15 from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named,
Ephesians 3:16 that He would grant you, according to his glorious riches, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit, as to the inner man;
Ephesians 3:17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: <transChange>and be ye</transChange> rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians 3:18 that ye may be able, with all the saints, to comprehend what <transChange>is</transChange> the breadth, and length, and depth,
Ephesians 3:19 and height, and to know the love of Christ, which surpasseth knowledge; that ye may be filled according to the abundant fulness of God.
Ephesians 3:20 Now to Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we <transChange>can</transChange> ask or think, according to the power operating in us,
Ephesians 3:21 to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all the generations of eternal ages. Amen. <chapter eID="gen6288" osisID="Eph.3"/>
Ephesians 4:0 <chapter osisID="Eph.4" sID="gen6310"/>
Ephesians 4:1 I therefore, a prisoner for <transChange>the sake of</transChange> the Lord, exhort you to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all humility and meekness;
Ephesians 4:2 <transChange>and</transChange> with long-suffering forbear one another in love,
Ephesians 4:3 endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: <transChange>for there is but</transChange> one body and one Spirit,
Ephesians 4:4 even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
Ephesians 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Ephesians 4:6 one God and Father of all, who <transChange>is</transChange> above all, and through all, and in all.
Ephesians 4:7 But grace is given to each of us, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians 4:8 Wherefore it is said, "When he ascended on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men."
Ephesians 4:9 Now this <transChange>expression</transChange> "He ascended" what does it mean, but that He descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians 4:10 He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens, that he might fill all <transChange>things.</transChange>
Ephesians 4:11 And <transChange>therefore</transChange> He gave some <transChange>to be</transChange> apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, <transChange>and</transChange> some pastors and teachers; to qualify holy <transChange>men</transChange> for the work of the ministry,
Ephesians 4:12 to the edifying of the body of Christ:
Ephesians 4:13 till we all arrive in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at perfect maturity, <transChange>even</transChange> to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.
Ephesians 4:14 That we may be no longer children fluctuating and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the artful insinuations of men, <transChange>and their</transChange> crafty methods of deceiving;
Ephesians 4:15 but holding the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him, who is the head, <transChange>even</transChange> Christ:
Ephesians 4:16 from whom the whole body being fitly joined together and compacted by the aid of every joint, according to the operation proportioned to every part, maketh an increase to the edification of itself in love.
Ephesians 4:17 This I say therefore, and charge <transChange>you</transChange> in <transChange>the name of</transChange> the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk,
Ephesians 4:18 in the vanity of their mind, darkened in the<transChange>ir</transChange> understanding, <transChange>and</transChange> alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, by reason of the hardness of their heart:
Ephesians 4:19 who, being past feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to commit all uncleanness with greediness.
Ephesians 4:20 But ye have not so learned Christ;
Ephesians 4:21 if ye have indeed hearkened to Him, and been instructed in Him, as the truth is in Jesus; to put off the old man,
Ephesians 4:22 <transChange>which</transChange> according to <transChange>your</transChange> former conversation <transChange>was</transChange> corrupted with deceitful lusts,
Ephesians 4:23 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
Ephesians 4:24 and to put on the new man, which according to <transChange>the image of</transChange> God is created in righteousness, and true holiness.
Ephesians 4:25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak <transChange>ye</transChange> every one truth to his neighbor; for we are <transChange>all</transChange> members of one society.
Ephesians 4:26 Be angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath;
Ephesians 4:27 and give not the devil room <transChange>to ensnare you.</transChange>
Ephesians 4:28 Let him that stole steal no more; but rather let him labour, doing <transChange>some</transChange> good with <transChange>his</transChange> hands, that he may have <transChange>something</transChange> to bestow on him that hath need <transChange>of it.</transChange>
Ephesians 4:29 Let no corrupt word come out of your mouth; but what <transChange>is</transChange> good to useful edification, that it may benefit the hearers.
Ephesians 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption.
Ephesians 4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and fury, and clamor, and calumny, be put away from you, with all malice: and be kind one to another,
Ephesians 4:32 tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgiveth you. <chapter eID="gen6310" osisID="Eph.4"/>
Ephesians 5:0 <chapter osisID="Eph.5" sID="gen6343"/>
Ephesians 5:1 Be ye therefore imitators of God as <transChange>his</transChange> dear children; and walk in love,
Ephesians 5:2 even as Christ hath loved us, and given Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweet perfume.
Ephesians 5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or inordinate desire, let it not be even named among you; for so it becometh saints:
Ephesians 5:4 nor ribaldry, nor buffoonery, nor <transChange>wanton</transChange> jesting, which are not meet: but rather giving of thanks.
Ephesians 5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean <transChange>person,</transChange> nor covetous <transChange>man,</transChange> (who is an idolater,) hath <transChange>any</transChange> inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Ephesians 5:6 Let no one deceive you with vain words: for because of these <transChange>things</transChange> cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
Ephesians 5:7 Therefore be not partners with them.
Ephesians 5:8 For ye were heretofore darkness, but now <transChange>ye are</transChange> light in the Lord:
Ephesians 5:9 walk <transChange>therefore</transChange> as children of light, (for the fruit of the Spirit <transChange>is</transChange> in all goodness and righteousness and truth,)
Ephesians 5:10 approving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians 5:11 And have no communion with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
Ephesians 5:12 For it is a shame even to relate the things <transChange>that are</transChange> done by them in secret.
Ephesians 5:13 But all <transChange>things to be</transChange> reproved: are made manifest by the light: for whatever doth make manifest, is light.
Ephesians 5:14 Wherefore He saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
Ephesians 5:15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise <transChange>men:</transChange>
Ephesians 5:16 redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians 5:17 Wherefore be not thoughtless, but consider what <transChange>is</transChange> the will of the Lord.
Ephesians 5:18 And be not drunk with wine, in which there is riotous excess; but be filled with the Spirit:
Ephesians 5:19 speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord:
Ephesians 5:20 always giving thanks for all to God even the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:
Ephesians 5:21 submitting yourselves to each other in the fear of God.
Ephesians 5:22 Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord:
Ephesians 5:23 for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and the saviour of <transChange>that</transChange> body.
Ephesians 5:24 As the church then is subject to Christ, so also <transChange>should</transChange> wives <transChange>be</transChange> to their own husbands in every thing.
Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave up Himself for it:
Ephesians 5:26 to sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
Ephesians 5:27 that He might prepare it for Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy and unblameable.
Ephesians 5:28 Men ought so to love their wives, as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself.
Ephesians 5:29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord also <transChange>doth</transChange> the church:
Ephesians 5:30 for we are members of his body, <transChange>as if taken</transChange> out of his flesh, and of his bones, <transChange>as Eve was out of Adam's.</transChange>
Ephesians 5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
Ephesians 5:32 This mystery is great: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.
Ephesians 5:33 Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and let the wife reverence <transChange>her</transChange> husband. <chapter eID="gen6343" osisID="Eph.5"/>
Ephesians 6:0 <chapter osisID="Eph.6" sID="gen6377"/>
Ephesians 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Ephesians 6:2 Honour thy father and thy mother, (which is the first commandment with promise,)
Ephesians 6:3 that it may be well with thee, and thou shalt be long-lived upon the earth.
Ephesians 6:4 And ye fathers, do not exasperate your children: but educate them in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
Ephesians 6:5 Servants, obey <transChange>them that are your</transChange> masters according to the flesh, with reverential fear, in the simplicity of your heart, as unto Christ:
Ephesians 6:6 not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
Ephesians 6:7 with good-will, <transChange>as</transChange> serving the Lord rather than men:
Ephesians 6:8 knowing that whatever good any one doth, he shall receive <transChange>the reward of</transChange> it from the Lord, whether He be a slave or free.
Ephesians 6:9 And <transChange>ye</transChange> masters, do the same to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that ye yourselves also have a Master in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.
Ephesians 6:10 Moreover, my brethren, strengthen yourselves in the Lord, and in his mighty power.
Ephesians 6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil.
Ephesians 6:12 For our conflict is not with flesh and blood <transChange>only,</transChange> but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the world <transChange>and</transChange> of the darkness of this age, against wicked spirits in heavenly <transChange>places.</transChange>
Ephesians 6:13 Take therefore the complete armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.
Ephesians 6:14 Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth, and putting on the breast-plate of righteousness:
Ephesians 6:15 and having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:
Ephesians 6:16 over all taking the shield of faith, whereby ye will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked <transChange>one:</transChange>
Ephesians 6:17 take also the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
Ephesians 6:18 praying at all seasons with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and intercession for all the saints;
Ephesians 6:19 and for me <transChange>particularly,</transChange> that utterance may be given me, that I may open my mouth with freedom, to make known the mystery of the gospel:
Ephesians 6:20 for which I am an ambassador <transChange>though</transChange> in chains: that I may speak boldly in <transChange>behalf of</transChange> it, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians 6:21 But that ye also may know my <transChange>affairs, and</transChange> what I am doing <transChange>here,</transChange> Tychicus a beloved brother, and a faithful minister in the Lord, shall make all known to you: whom I have sent to you,
Ephesians 6:22 for this very <transChange>end,</transChange> that ye might know our <transChange>concerns,</transChange> and that he may comfort your hearts.
Ephesians 6:23 Peace <transChange>be</transChange> to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 6:24 Grace <transChange>be</transChange> with all that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. <chapter eID="gen6377" osisID="Eph.6"/> <div eID="gen6240" osisID="Eph" type="book"/>

Philippians 1:1 <hi type="bold">Paul</hi> and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
Philippians 1:2 grace <transChange>be</transChange> unto you, and peace from God our father, and <transChange>from</transChange> the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1:3 I give thanks unto my God upon every mention of you,
Philippians 1:4 (always making supplication for you all with joy
Philippians 1:5 in every prayer of mine) for your attachment to the gospel, from the first day even till now;
Philippians 1:6 being confident of this, that He who hath begun a good work in you will <transChange>continue to</transChange> perfect <transChange>it</transChange> till the day of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1:7 As it is just for me to think this of you all, because ye have me in <transChange>your</transChange> heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, being all of you partakers of the <transChange>same</transChange> grace with me.
Philippians 1:8 For God is my witness, how much I long for you all, <transChange>as</transChange> with the bowels of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <transChange>in</transChange> all discernment;
Philippians 1:10 that ye may try things that differ, that ye may be sincere and without offence until the day of Christ;
Philippians 1:11 being full of the fruits of righteousness <transChange>which are</transChange> through Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.
Philippians 1:12 But I would have you know, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, that the things, which have befallen me, have proved rather to the advancement of the gospel:
Philippians 1:13 so that my bonds are manifest in all the palace, and all other <transChange>places, to be</transChange> for the sake of Christ;
Philippians 1:14 and many of the brethren in the Lord, encouraged by my bonds, are much more bold to publish the word without fear.
Philippians 1:15 Some indeed through envy and strife, and some also through good-will:
Philippians 1:16 the former preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, thinking to add affliction to my bonds;
Philippians 1:17 the others out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
Philippians 1:18 What then? yet every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached: and in this I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice;
Philippians 1:19 for I know that this shall turn to my safety through your prayer, and the aid of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1:20 According to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall be put to shame in nothing; but <transChange>that</transChange> with all freedom of speech, as always, <transChange>so</transChange> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
Philippians 1:21 For to me to live <transChange>is</transChange> Christ, and to die <transChange>is</transChange> gain: and if I live in the flesh, this <transChange>is</transChange> the fruit of my labor:
Philippians 1:22 so that I know not what to chuse;
Philippians 1:23 for I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which <transChange>is</transChange> much preferable:
Philippians 1:24 but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for you.
Philippians 1:25 And as I am confident of this, I know that I shall abide and shall continue with you all, for your improvement and the joy of <transChange>your</transChange> faith:
Philippians 1:26 that your rejoicing in Christ Jesus may abound through me, by my coming to you again.
Philippians 1:27 Only behave worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear of you, that ye stand firm in one Spirit, striving together <transChange>as</transChange> with one soul for the saith of the gospel;
Philippians 1:28 and <transChange>are</transChange> in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is a demonstration of ruin to them, but to you of salvation, and this from God.
Philippians 1:29 For to you it is granted as a favor from Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for his sake:
Philippians 1:30 having the same conflict as ye saw in me, and now hear <transChange>to be</transChange> in me. <chapter eID="gen6403" osisID="Phil.1"/>
Philippians 2:0 <chapter osisID="Phil.2" sID="gen6434"/>
Philippians 2:1 If therefore there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any participation of the Spirit,
Philippians 2:2 if any bowels of compassion, compleat ye my joy, be like-minded, maintaining the same love, with your souls united, <transChange>in</transChange> attending to the one <transChange>thing needful.</transChange>
Philippians 2:3 <transChange>Do</transChange> nothing through strife or vain-glory, but in lowliness of mind each esteeming others better than themselves.
Philippians 2:4 Look not every one to his own <transChange>interests only,</transChange> but every one also to <transChange>the concerns</transChange> of others.
Philippians 2:5 Let the same mind be in you, which <transChange>was</transChange> also in Christ Jesus:
Philippians 2:6 who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be as God.
Philippians 2:7 Yet He emptied himself, assuming the form of a servant, when made in the likeness of men:
Philippians 2:8 and being in the human state, He humbled himself, and was obedient even unto death, and <transChange>that</transChange> the death of the cross.
Philippians 2:9 Wherefore God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name above every name:
Philippians 2:10 that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of celestial <transChange>beings,</transChange> as well as of those on earth, and of those under the earth;
Philippians 2:11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ <transChange>is</transChange> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians 2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed <transChange>the gospel,</transChange> not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence; be <transChange>still</transChange> working out your own salvation <transChange>though</transChange> with fear and trembling:
Philippians 2:13 for it is God that worketh in you both to will, and to work, out of <transChange>his own</transChange> good-pleasure.
Philippians 2:14 Do all <transChange>things</transChange> without murmurings and disputings:
Philippians 2:15 that ye may be blameless and inoffensive, the children of God without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom ye shine as lights in the world,
Philippians 2:16 exhibiting the word of life; to my rejoicing in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.
Philippians 2:17 But if I be even poured forth as a libation on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.
Philippians 2:18 And <transChange>for</transChange> the same <transChange>cause</transChange> do ye also rejoice, and congratulate with me.
Philippians 2:19 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be refreshed, <transChange>by</transChange> knowing <transChange>the state of</transChange> your affairs.
Philippians 2:20 For I have no one of a like spirit, who will with a <transChange>kind of</transChange> natural affection take care of your affairs.
Philippians 2:21 For all seek their own <transChange>interests,</transChange> not those of Christ Jesus.
Philippians 2:22 But ye know the proof <transChange>I have had</transChange> of him, that as son with a father he served with me in the gospel.
Philippians 2:23 I hope therefore to send him as soon as I see <transChange>the issue of</transChange> my own affairs.
Philippians 2:24 But I trust in the Lord, that I shall soon come myself too.
Philippians 2:25 However, I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother, and fellow-laborer, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, who ministred to my wants:
Philippians 2:26 for he much longed after you all, and was greatly concerned because ye had heard that he was sick.
Philippians 2:27 For indeed he was sick <transChange>and</transChange> nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians 2:28 I have sent him therefore the more desirously, that when ye see him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful.
Philippians 2:29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and have such in high esteem:
Philippians 2:30 because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding <transChange>his own</transChange> life, <transChange>so</transChange> that he might fill up what was wanting in your kind offices towards me. <chapter eID="gen6434" osisID="Phil.2"/>

Philippians 3:1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you <transChange>is</transChange> not irksome to me, and for you <transChange>it is</transChange> safe.
Philippians 3:2 Beware of <transChange>those that are like</transChange> dogs, beware of evil doers, beware of the concision.
Philippians 3:3 For we are <transChange>of</transChange> the <transChange>true</transChange> circumcision, who worship God in spirit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh.
Philippians 3:4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks <transChange>he hath whereof</transChange> to trust in the flesh, I more:
Philippians 3:5 having been circumcised on the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of Hebrews, with respect to the law a pharisee,
Philippians 3:6 as to zeal persecuting the church, as to the righteousness of the law blameless: but those <transChange>things,</transChange>
Philippians 3:7 which were <transChange>once</transChange> gain to me, I counted loss for Christ.
Philippians 3:8 Yea doubtless and I count all but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all, and I account them but dung, that I may gain Christ, and be found in Him,
Philippians 3:9 not having my own righteousness <transChange>which is</transChange> of the law, but that <transChange>which is</transChange> by the faith of Christ, the righteousness <transChange>which is</transChange> of God by faith: that I may know Him,
Philippians 3:10 and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;
Philippians 3:11 if by any means I may attain to the resurrection of the dead:
Philippians 3:12 not that I have yet won <transChange>the prize,</transChange> or am already perfect: but I press forward to acquire that <transChange>perfection,</transChange> for which also I have been apprehended by Christ Jesus.
Philippians 3:13 Brethren, I count not myself to have attained <transChange>it:</transChange> but one thing <transChange>I do,</transChange> forgetting the things <transChange>which are</transChange> behind, and stretching forward to those before,
Philippians 3:14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 3:15 Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, attend to this: and if in any thing ye think differently, God will reveal this also unto you.
Philippians 3:16 But in what we have attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same <transChange>thing.</transChange>
Philippians 3:17 Brethren, be imitators of me, and observe those that walk as ye have us for an example.
Philippians 3:18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, <transChange>that they are</transChange> the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose end <transChange>is</transChange> destruction,
Philippians 3:19 whose God <transChange>is their</transChange> belly, and <transChange>whose</transChange> glory <transChange>is</transChange> in their shame; who mind earthly <transChange>things</transChange>) For our conversation is in heaven,
Philippians 3:20 from whence also we expect <transChange>the</transChange> Saviour, <transChange>our</transChange> Lord Jesus Christ: who will change our vile body,
Philippians 3:21 that it may be made like his glorious body, according to the energy of his ability to subdue all <transChange>things</transChange> to Himself. <chapter eID="gen6465" osisID="Phil.3"/>
Philippians 4:0 <chapter osisID="Phil.4" sID="gen6487"/>
Philippians 4:1 Wherefore, my brethren, beloved and much desired, my joy and crown, so stand ye fast in the Lord, <transChange>my</transChange> beloved.
Philippians 4:2 I exhort Euodia, and Syntyche to be perfectly united in the Lord.
Philippians 4:3 And I entreat thee likewise, my faithful collegue, to assist them, for they laboured with me in the gospel, and Clement also, and my other fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.
Philippians 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always, <transChange>and</transChange> again I say, Rejoice.
Philippians 4:5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <transChange>is</transChange> at hand.
Philippians 4:6 Be anxious in nothing: but in every <transChange>thing</transChange> by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known before God.
Philippians 4:7 And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:8 Finally <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, whatever <transChange>things</transChange> are true, whatever <transChange>things are</transChange> venerable, whatever things <transChange>are</transChange> just, whatever things <transChange>are</transChange> pure, whatever things <transChange>are</transChange> friendly, whatever things <transChange>are</transChange> reputable, if <transChange>there be</transChange> any virtue, and if <transChange>there be</transChange> any praise, think of these <transChange>things:</transChange>
Philippians 4:9 <transChange>and</transChange> what ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these practise; and the God of peace will be with you.
Philippians 4:10 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, that your care for me has now flourished again; for whom ye were indeed careful <transChange>before,</transChange> but ye wanted opportunity.
Philippians 4:11 Not that I speak on account of want; for I have learnt in whatever <transChange>circumstances</transChange> I am, to be contented.
Philippians 4:12 I know both <transChange>how</transChange> to be abased, and <transChange>how</transChange> to abound: in every <transChange>place,</transChange> and in all <transChange>conditions</transChange> I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to be in want.
Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.
Philippians 4:14 Nevertheless ye did well <transChange>in</transChange> communicating to <transChange>the relief of</transChange> my affliction.
Philippians 4:15 And ye Philippians know, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I was departing from Macedonia, no church communicated to me on the score of giving and receiving, but you only.
Philippians 4:16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to <transChange>supply</transChange> my wants.
Philippians 4:17 Not that I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
Philippians 4:18 And <transChange>indeed</transChange> I have <transChange>it</transChange> all, and <transChange>now</transChange> abound: I am fully <transChange>supplied,</transChange> having received of Epaphroditus the things <transChange>sent</transChange> by you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
Philippians 4:19 And my God will supply all your wants, according to his riches, in glory, by Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:20 Now to our God and Father <transChange>be</transChange> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Philippians 4:21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you:
Philippians 4:22 <transChange>and</transChange> all the saints <transChange>here</transChange> salute you, but especially those of Cesar's household.
Philippians 4:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <transChange>be</transChange> with you all. Amen. <chapter eID="gen6487" osisID="Phil.4"/> <div eID="gen6402" osisID="Phil" type="book"/>

Colossians 1:1 <hi type="bold">Paul</hi> an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God,
Colossians 1:2 and Timothy <transChange>our</transChange> brother, to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ at Colosse: grace <transChange>be</transChange> to you and peace from God our Father, and <transChange>from</transChange> the Lord Jesus Christ.
Colossians 1:3 We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always in <transChange>our</transChange> prayers for you:
Colossians 1:4 (having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and <transChange>your</transChange> love to all the saints:)
Colossians 1:5 for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which ye have heard before in the word of truth, <transChange>that is</transChange> the gospel;
Colossians 1:6 which is come unto you, even as in all the world, and is fruitful; as <transChange>it hath been</transChange> also among you, from the day in which ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth.
Colossians 1:7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you;
Colossians 1:8 who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
Colossians 1:9 For this <transChange>cause</transChange> we also, from the day that we heard <transChange>it,</transChange> cease not to pray for you, and to request that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding:
Colossians 1:10 that ye may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Colossians 1:11 strengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joy;
Colossians 1:12 giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet for a portion of the inheritance of the saints in light:
Colossians 1:13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath transferred <transChange>us</transChange> into the kingdom of his beloved Son:
Colossians 1:14 in whom we have redemption by his blood, <transChange>even</transChange> the remission of sins.
Colossians 1:15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of the whole creation:
Colossians 1:16 for by Him were all <transChange>things</transChange> created, <transChange>that are</transChange> in heaven, and that <transChange>are</transChange> on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether <transChange>they be</transChange> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all were created by Him, and for Him.
Colossians 1:17 He is before all, and by Him all <transChange>things</transChange> subsist.
Colossians 1:18 And He is the head of the body, <transChange>which is</transChange> the church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in all <transChange>things</transChange> He might have the pre-eminence.
Colossians 1:19 For it pleased <transChange>the Father,</transChange> that all fulness should dwell in Him;
Colossians 1:20 and by Him to reconcile all <transChange>things</transChange> to Himself, having made peace by the blood of his cross; by Him <transChange>only,</transChange> whether <transChange>they be things</transChange> on earth, or <transChange>things</transChange> in heaven.
Colossians 1:21 And you that were formerly alienated, and enemies in <transChange>your</transChange> mind by wicked works,
Colossians 1:22 yet now hath He reconciled in the body of his flesh, through death, to present you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his sight:
Colossians 1:23 if so be ye continue grounded and settled in the faith, and be not moved from the gospel, which ye have heard, <transChange>and</transChange> which hath been preached throughout the whole creation, of which I Paul am a minister.
Colossians 1:24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up what is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
Colossians 1:25 Of which I was made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given me towards you, that I might fully declare the word of God:
Colossians 1:26 <transChange>even</transChange> that mystery which was hid from <transChange>former</transChange> ages and generations, but is now manifested to his saints:
Colossians 1:27 to whom God would make known the rich glory of this mystery, among the gentiles; which is <transChange>this, that</transChange> Christ <transChange>is</transChange> in you the hope of glory:
Colossians 1:28 whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
Colossians 1:29 <transChange>in order</transChange> to which I also labour, striving earnestly according to his energy which operates in me with power. <chapter eID="gen6512" osisID="Col.1"/>
Colossians 2:0 <chapter osisID="Col.2" sID="gen6542"/>
Colossians 2:1 For I would have you know what a great conflict I have for you, and for those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen me in person:
Colossians 2:2 that their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all the riches of a full assurance of understanding <transChange>in these things,</transChange> to the acknowledgment of the mystery of <transChange>our</transChange> God and Father, and of Christ:
Colossians 2:3 in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians 2:4 And this I say, least any one should deceive you with fine speeches.
Colossians 2:5 For though I be absent in body, yet am I with you in spirit, rejoicing and beholding your regularity, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
Colossians 2:6 Therefore as ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him;
Colossians 2:7 rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught <transChange>it,</transChange> abounding therein with thanksgiving.
Colossians 2:8 Take heed least any one make a prey of you by philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ:
Colossians 2:9 for all the fulness of the deity dwelleth personally in Him.
Colossians 2:10 And ye are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.
Colossians 2:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision not performed by hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision <transChange>which is</transChange> of Christ:
Colossians 2:12 being buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are raised together with <transChange>Him,</transChange> through faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead.
Colossians 2:13 And when ye were dead in trespasses, and <transChange>in</transChange> the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,
Colossians 2:14 and cancelled the obligation we were under by <transChange>ritual</transChange> decrees, which was grievous to us, and hath taken it quite away, <transChange>even</transChange> nailing it to <transChange>his</transChange> cross.
Colossians 2:15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, He made them an open spectacle, triumphing over them by it.
Colossians 2:16 Let no one therefore judge you on account of meat, or drink, or in respect of a feast, or a new-moon, or sabbaths;
Colossians 2:17 which are a shadow of <transChange>good</transChange> things to come, but the body <transChange>is</transChange> of Christ.
Colossians 2:18 Let no one deprive you of your reward by an affected humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into what he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his carnal mind;
Colossians 2:19 and not adhering to the head, from which all the body, being supplied and held together <transChange>as</transChange> by joints and bands, increaseth with the increase of God.
Colossians 2:20 If therefore ye be dead with Christ from the elements of the world; why, as if living in the world, are ye subject to <transChange>ceremonial</transChange> ordinances,
Colossians 2:21 (<transChange>such as</transChange> "touch not, taste not,
Colossians 2:22 handle not," which all tend to corruption in the using,) according to the commandments and doctrines of men?
Colossians 2:23 which <transChange>things</transChange> indeed have a pretence to wisdom in voluntary worship, and humiliation, and bodily penance, <transChange>as</transChange> having no regard to the satisfying of the flesh. <chapter eID="gen6542" osisID="Col.2"/>
Colossians 3:0 <chapter osisID="Col.3" sID="gen6566"/>
Colossians 3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek the things <transChange>that are</transChange> above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.
Colossians 3:2 Mind the things above, not those on the earth.
Colossians 3:3 For ye are dead <transChange>as to the world,</transChange> and your life is hid with Christ in God.
Colossians 3:4 When Christ, <transChange>who is</transChange> your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.
Colossians 3:5 Mortify therefore your members <transChange>that are</transChange> upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, <transChange>disorderly</transChange> passion, evil concupiscence, and insatiable desire, which is <transChange>indeed</transChange> idolatry:
Colossians 3:6 for which <transChange>things</transChange> the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.
Colossians 3:7 In which ye also formerly walked, when ye lived among them.
Colossians 3:8 But now put away all <transChange>these</transChange> also, wrath, animosity, malice, calumny, <transChange>and</transChange> filthy discourse out of your mouth.
Colossians 3:9 Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put off the old man with his <transChange>evil</transChange> practices;
Colossians 3:10 and have put on the new <transChange>man,</transChange> which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him that created him.
Colossians 3:11 Wherein there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, <transChange>or</transChange> free: but Christ <transChange>is</transChange> all and in all.
Colossians 3:12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God holy and beloved, bowels of mercy, benignity, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
Colossians 3:13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any <transChange>one</transChange> has a complaint against any: even as Christ hath forgiven you, so also <transChange>do</transChange> ye.
Colossians 3:14 And above all these <transChange>put on</transChange> love, which is the band of perfection.
Colossians 3:15 And let the peace of God preside in your hearts, to which ye are also called <transChange>as united</transChange> in one body: and be thankful <transChange>for it.</transChange>
Colossians 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another by psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude singing in your hearts to the Lord.
Colossians 3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <transChange>do</transChange> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to <transChange>our</transChange> God and Father by Him.
Colossians 3:18 Wives, be subject to your husbands, as becometh <transChange>you</transChange> in the Lord:
Colossians 3:19 <transChange>and ye</transChange> husbands, love your wives, and be not embittered against them.
Colossians 3:20 Children, obey <transChange>your</transChange> parents in all <transChange>things;</transChange> for this is well-pleasing to the Lord:
Colossians 3:21 <transChange>and ye</transChange> fathers, do not irritate your children, least they be discouraged.
Colossians 3:22 Servants, be obedient in all <transChange>things</transChange> to <transChange>your</transChange> lawful masters, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but in uprightness of heart, fearing God; and whatever <transChange>service</transChange> ye do,
Colossians 3:23 do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;
Colossians 3:24 knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ;

Colossians 4:2 Persevere in prayer, and be watchful in it, with thanksgiving.
Colossians 4:3 Praying at the same time for us also, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to declare the mystery of Christ, for which also I am in bonds: that I may make it manifest, as I ought.
Colossians 4:4 Behave yourselves wisely towards them that are without,
Colossians 4:5 redeeming the time.

Colossians 4:10 Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you, and Marcus nephew to Barnabas, concerning whom ye have received orders; (if he come to you, receive him;) and Jesus <transChange>who is</transChange> called Justus:

Colossians 4:12 Epaphras, who is <transChange>one</transChange> of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you; who always strives earnestly for you in <transChange>his</transChange> prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God:

Grace <transChange>be</transChange> to you, and peace from God our Father, and <transChange>from</transChange> the Lord Jesus Christ.
I Thessalonians 1:2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers.
I Thessalonians 1:3 Incessantly remembering your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father:
I Thessalonians 1:4 knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God.
I Thessalonians 1:5 For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much certainty; as ye know what sort of persons we were among you for your sakes.
I Thessalonians 1:6 And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word <transChange>tho'</transChange> in much affliction, <transChange>yet</transChange> with joy of the holy Ghost.
I Thessalonians 1:7 So that ye became examples to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
I Thessalonians 1:8 For the word of the Lord sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia; but also in every place your faith towards God is spread abroad, so that we have no need to say any <transChange>thing of it.</transChange>
I Thessalonians 1:9 For they themselves declare concerning us what kind of entrance we had among you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God;
I Thessalonians 1:10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, <transChange>even</transChange> Jesus who delivereth us from the wrath to come. <chapter eID="gen6612" osisID="1Thess.1"/>
I Thessalonians 2:0 <chapter osisID="1Thess.2" sID="gen6623"/>
I Thessalonians 2:1 For ye yourselves, brethren, know our entrance among you, that it was not <transChange>in</transChange> vain.
I Thessalonians 2:2 But though we had suffered before and been injuriously treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we spake boldly in <transChange>the name of</transChange> our God to declare unto you the gospel of God with much conflict.
I Thessalonians 2:3 For our exhortation <transChange>was</transChange> not of deceit, nor of impurity, nor in guile:
I Thessalonians 2:4 but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.
I Thessalonians 2:5 For neither at any time used we flattering speech, as ye know, nor covetous pretence, God <transChange>is</transChange> witness:
I Thessalonians 2:6 nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others: though we might have expected maintenance, as the apostles of Christ.
I Thessalonians 2:7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
I Thessalonians 2:8 so we, being affectionately desirous of you, were willing to impart to you, not only the gospel of God, but even our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
I Thessalonians 2:9 For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for working night and day, that we might not be burthensome to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.
I Thessalonians 2:10 Ye <transChange>are</transChange> witnesses, and God <transChange>also,</transChange> how holily, and justly, and unblameably we behaved towards you that believe:
I Thessalonians 2:11 as ye know <transChange>likewise,</transChange> how we exhorted and comforted every one of you, as a father his children;
I Thessalonians 2:12 and charged <transChange>you,</transChange> that ye should walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.
I Thessalonians 2:13 For this also we thank God continually, that when ye received the word of God, which ye heard from us, ye received <transChange>it</transChange> not <transChange>as</transChange> the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which also worketh effectually in you that believe.
I Thessalonians 2:14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God, which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus, <transChange>in</transChange> that ye also have suffered the same <transChange>things</transChange> from your own countrymen, as they <transChange>have</transChange> from the Jews:
I Thessalonians 2:15 who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; who are displeasing to God, and contrary to all men:
I Thessalonians 2:16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, <transChange>thus going on</transChange> to fill up their sins perpetually: but wrath is coming upon them to extremity.
I Thessalonians 2:17 But we, brethren, being separated from you for a season, in person not in heart, endeavoured the more earnestly to see you again with much desire.
I Thessalonians 2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you (even I Paul) once and again; but Satan hindered us.
I Thessalonians 2:19 For what <transChange>is</transChange> our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? <transChange>are</transChange> not ye also <transChange>among others</transChange> in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
I Thessalonians 2:20 for ye are our glory and <transChange>our</transChange> joy. <chapter eID="gen6623" osisID="1Thess.2"/>
I Thessalonians 3:0 <chapter osisID="1Thess.3" sID="gen6644"/>
I Thessalonians 3:1 Wherefore being able to contain no longer, we were content to be left alone at Athens,
I Thessalonians 3:2 and sent Timothy our brother, and a minister of God, and our fellow-labourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you concerning your faith;
I Thessalonians 3:3 that no one might be shaken by these afflictions: for ye yourselves know that we are appointed hereunto.
I Thessalonians 3:4 For when we were with you, we told you before that we should be afflicted, as it came to pass, and ye know.
I Thessalonians 3:5 For this <transChange>cause</transChange> being able to wait no longer, I sent to know <transChange>the state of</transChange> your faith, least the tempter should have tempted you, and our labor have been in vain.
I Thessalonians 3:6 But now Timothy being come back to us from you, and having brought us good tidings concerning your faith and love, and that ye have always a good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we indeed <transChange>do to see</transChange> you;
I Thessalonians 3:7 by this we were comforted in you, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, under all our affliction and distress, because of your faith:
I Thessalonians 3:8 for now we are revived, since you are stedfast in the Lord.
I Thessalonians 3:9 For what thanks can we render to God concerning you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice on your account before our God,
I Thessalonians 3:10 night and day most ardently praying, that we may see your face, and perfect whatever is wanting in your faith?
I Thessalonians 3:11 And may God himself even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you:
I Thessalonians 3:12 and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love to one another, and to all <transChange>men,</transChange> as we <transChange>do</transChange> towards you:
I Thessalonians 3:13 that your hearts may be established unblameable in holiness, before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. <chapter eID="gen6644" osisID="1Thess.3"/>
I Thessalonians 4:0 <chapter osisID="1Thess.4" sID="gen6658"/>
I Thessalonians 4:1 As to what remains therefore, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, we intreat and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received <transChange>instructions</transChange> from us, how ye ought to walk and to please God, ye would abound <transChange>therein</transChange> more <transChange>and more.</transChange>
I Thessalonians 4:2 For ye know what commandments we gave you from the Lord Jesus.
I Thessalonians 4:3 For this is the will of God, <transChange>even</transChange> your sanctification: that ye should abstain from fornication,
I Thessalonians 4:4 <transChange>and</transChange> that every one of you should possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,
I Thessalonians 4:5 not in the passion of lust, like the heathens who know not God.
I Thessalonians 4:6 That no <transChange>one</transChange> over-reach, or wrong his brother in <transChange>any</transChange> thing: because the Lord <transChange>is</transChange> an avenger of all such <transChange>crimes,</transChange> as we also told you before, and testified <transChange>to you.</transChange>
I Thessalonians 4:7 For God hath not called us to impurity, but to holiness.
I Thessalonians 4:8 He therefore who rejecteth <transChange>us,</transChange> rejecteth not man, but God; who hath given us his holy Spirit.
I Thessalonians 4:9 But as to brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
I Thessalonians 4:10 And indeed ye do it to all the brethren, that are in all Macedonia; but we exhort you, brethren, to abound <transChange>in it</transChange> more <transChange>and more:</transChange>
I Thessalonians 4:11 and endeavour to be quiet, and mind your own <transChange>affairs,</transChange> and work with your own hands,
I Thessalonians 4:12 as we gave you in charge, that ye may walk decently toward those <transChange>that are</transChange> without, and may have need of no one's <transChange>assistance.</transChange>
I Thessalonians 4:13 But I would not have you ignorant, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, concerning those that are fallen asleep, that ye may not be grieved like others who have no hope:
I Thessalonians 4:14 for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also those, that sleep in Jesus, will God bring with Him.
I Thessalonians 4:15 For this we tell you in the word of the Lord, that we who <transChange>shall be</transChange> living <transChange>and</transChange> remain to the coming of the Lord, shall not be before those that are asleep.
I Thessalonians 4:16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with acclamation, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
I Thessalonians 4:17 then we who <transChange>are</transChange> living <transChange>and</transChange> remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we for ever be with the Lord.
I Thessalonians 4:18 Therefore comfort one another with these words. <chapter eID="gen6658" osisID="1Thess.4"/>
I Thessalonians 5:0 <chapter osisID="1Thess.5" sID="gen6677"/>
I Thessalonians 5:1 But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need of <transChange>my</transChange> writing to you:
I Thessalonians 5:2 for ye yourselves know full well, that the day of the Lord cometh like a thief in the night.
I Thessalonians 5:3 And when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
I Thessalonians 5:4 But ye, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, are not in darkness, that <transChange>that</transChange> day should seize you as a thief:
I Thessalonians 5:5 ye are all children of the light, and of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
I Thessalonians 5:6 Therefore let us not sleep like others, but let us watch and be sober:
I Thessalonians 5:7 for they, that sleep, sleep in the night; and drunkards are drunk in the night:
I Thessalonians 5:8 but let us, who are of the day, be sober; putting on the breast-plate of faith and love, and <transChange>for</transChange> an helmet the hope of salvation.
I Thessalonians 5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
I Thessalonians 5:10 who died for us, that whether we be awake, or asleep, we may live together with Him.
I Thessalonians 5:11 Wherefore comfort one another, and edify each <transChange>other,</transChange> as indeed ye do.
I Thessalonians 5:12 And we entreat you, brethren, to respect those that labour among you, and preside over you in the Lord, and instruct you;
I Thessalonians 5:13 and to esteem them very highly in love, on account of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
I Thessalonians 5:14 And admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be of a patient spirit towards all.
I Thessalonians 5:15 See that no one render evil for evil to any <transChange>man;</transChange> but always pursue <transChange>that which is</transChange> good, both to each other and to all <transChange>men.</transChange>
I Thessalonians 5:16 Be always joyful.
I Thessalonians 5:17 Pray continually.
I Thessalonians 5:18 In every <transChange>circumstance</transChange> be thankful; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
I Thessalonians 5:19 Quench not the Spirit.
I Thessalonians 5:20 Slight not prophesyings:
I Thessalonians 5:21 <transChange>yet</transChange> try all <transChange>things, and</transChange> hold fast <transChange>that which is</transChange> good.
I Thessalonians 5:22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.
I Thessalonians 5:23 And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly: and <transChange>grant that</transChange> your whole <transChange>frame,</transChange> spirit, soul, and body may be kept blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
I Thessalonians 5:24 Faithful <transChange>is</transChange> He that calleth you, who also will do <transChange>it.</transChange>
I Thessalonians 5:25 Brethren, pray for us.
I Thessalonians 5:26 Salute all the brethren with an holy kiss.
I Thessalonians 5:27 I adjure you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.

II Thessalonians 1:4 so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God, for your patience and faith under all your persecutions and afflictions which ye endure.
II Thessalonians 1:5 <transChange>Which are</transChange> a demonstration of the just judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
II Thessalonians 1:6 seeing <transChange>it is</transChange> a righteous <transChange>thing</transChange> with God to render affliction to those that afflict you;

II Thessalonians 1:9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction, by the presence of the Lord and by his glorious power:
II Thessalonians 1:10 in that day, when He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe; because our testimony among you was believed.
II Thessalonians 1:11 Wherefore we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of <transChange>this</transChange> calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of <transChange>his</transChange> goodness, and the work of faith with power:

II Thessalonians 2:1 But as to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto Him,
II Thessalonians 2:2 we beseech you, brethren, that ye be not soon moved from your <transChange>steadiness of</transChange> mind, or troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, that the day of Christ is at hand.
II Thessalonians 2:3 Let not any <transChange>one</transChange> deceive you by any means; for <transChange>it shall not come</transChange> till there come an apostasy first, and the man of sin be revealed,
II Thessalonians 2:4 the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or the object of worship; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
II Thessalonians 2:5 Do ye not remember, that when I was with you, I told you these things?
II Thessalonians 2:6 And ye know what now hindereth him from being revealed in his own time.
II Thessalonians 2:7 For the mystery of iniquity is already working, only there is one that hindreth till he be taken out of the way.
II Thessalonians 2:8 And then the wicked <transChange>one</transChange> shall be detected, whom the Lord will destroy by the breath of his mouth, and abolish by the brightness of his coming:
II Thessalonians 2:9 who comes, through the efficacy of Satan, with all <transChange>kind of</transChange> lying power, and signs,
II Thessalonians 2:10 and wonders, and with all iniquitous fraud, among those that <transChange>shall</transChange> perish; because they received not the love of the truth, by which they might be saved.
II Thessalonians 2:11 And for this <transChange>cause</transChange> God will send <transChange>upon</transChange> them the efficacy of error, so that they shall <transChange>themselves</transChange> believe the lie:
II Thessalonians 2:12 that they may all be condemned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in iniquity.
II Thessalonians 2:13 But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord; because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth:
II Thessalonians 2:14 to which He hath called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
II Thessalonians 2:15 Therefore, brethren, be steady, and hold fast the traditions, which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.
II Thessalonians 2:16 And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who hath loved us, and hath given <transChange>us</transChange> everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts,
II Thessalonians 2:17 and establish you in every good word and work. <chapter eID="gen6720" osisID="2Thess.2"/>

II Thessalonians 3:1 As for the rest, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be glorified, as <transChange>it is</transChange> among you:
II Thessalonians 3:2 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all have not faith.
II Thessalonians 3:3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and preserve <transChange>you</transChange> from the evil <transChange>one.</transChange>
II Thessalonians 3:4 And we trust in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do <transChange>the things</transChange> which we give you in charge.
II Thessalonians 3:5 And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
II Thessalonians 3:6 Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother who walketh disorderly, and not according to the instruction which he received from us.
II Thessalonians 3:7 For ye know how <transChange>ye</transChange> ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;
II Thessalonians 3:8 neither did we eat any one's bread for nothing; but with labor and toil, working night and day, that we might not be burthensome to any of you.
II Thessalonians 3:9 Not that we have not power, but that we might give ourselves <transChange>as</transChange> an example to you to imitate us.
II Thessalonians 3:10 For when we were with you, we gave you this charge, if any will not work, neither let him eat.
II Thessalonians 3:11 For we hear that there are some among you that walk disorderly, doing no work <transChange>themselves,</transChange> but very busy <transChange>in the affairs of others.</transChange>
II Thessalonians 3:12 Such we charge and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly and earn their own bread.
II Thessalonians 3:13 But be not you, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, discouraged from well-doing. And if any obey not our order,
II Thessalonians 3:14 by <transChange>this</transChange> epistle, mark such <transChange>a one,</transChange> and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.
II Thessalonians 3:15 However do not look upon <transChange>him</transChange> as an enemy, but admonish <transChange>him</transChange> as a brother.

I Timothy 1:2 to Timothy <transChange>my</transChange> true son in the faith, <transChange>be</transChange> grace, mercy, <transChange>and</transChange> peace from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I Timothy 1:3 As I exhorted thee to stay at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain <transChange>persons</transChange> not to teach other doctrine,
I Timothy 1:4 nor attend to fables and endless genealogies, which occasion debates, rather than pious edification in the faith:
I Timothy 1:5 <transChange>so do,</transChange> and <transChange>acquaint them that</transChange> the end of <transChange>that</transChange> charge is charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned:
I Timothy 1:6 from which some having swerved are turned aside to vain discourses;
I Timothy 1:7 desiring to be teachers of the law, though they neither understand what they say, nor what <transChange>things</transChange> they assert.
I Timothy 1:8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
I Timothy 1:9 knowing this, that a law does not lie against a righteous <transChange>person,</transChange> but <transChange>against</transChange> the lawless and unruly, the impious and wicked, the unholy and profane,
I Timothy 1:10 parricides, murderers, whoremongers, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, false-swearers, and if there be any thing else contrary to <transChange>that</transChange> sound doctrine,
I Timothy 1:11 <transChange>which is</transChange> according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I was intrusted.
I Timothy 1:12 And I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who gave me ability <transChange>for the work,</transChange> that He accounted me faithful, having put <transChange>me</transChange> into the ministry,
I Timothy 1:13 who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an oppressor. But I obtained mercy, because I did <transChange>it</transChange> ignorantly in unbelief: and the grace of our Lord superabounded,
I Timothy 1:14 with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
I Timothy 1:15 <transChange>It</transChange> is a truth <transChange>highly</transChange> to be believed, and worthy to be received by all, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners:---of whom I am <transChange>one of the</transChange> chief.
I Timothy 1:16 But for this <transChange>end</transChange> I obtained mercy, that in me a chief <transChange>sinner</transChange> Jesus Christ might display <transChange>his</transChange> long-suffering, for an example to those who should afterwards believe on Him to eternal life.
I Timothy 1:17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <transChange>be</transChange> honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
I Timothy 1:18 This charge I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which before came on thee, that by them thou mightest war a good warfare,
I Timothy 1:19 having faith and a good conscience, which some putting away have made shipwreck concerning the faith:

I Timothy 2:1 <transChange>This</transChange> then I exhort <transChange>thee</transChange> first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, <transChange>and</transChange> thanksgivings he made for all men;
I Timothy 2:2 <transChange>particularly</transChange> for kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and virtue.
I Timothy 2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour:
I Timothy 2:4 who is willing that all men should be saved, and <transChange>therefore</transChange> come to the knowledge of the truth.
I Timothy 2:5 For <transChange>there is</transChange> one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus:
I Timothy 2:6 who gave himself a ransom for all, a testimony <transChange>to be published</transChange> in due time,
I Timothy 2:7 for which I was appointed a herald and an apostle. I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not; <transChange>I am</transChange> a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
I Timothy 2:8 I direct therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath and debate:
I Timothy 2:9 likewise that women dress themselves in decent apparel with modesty and prudence, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly garments;
I Timothy 2:10 but in good works, as becometh women professing godliness.
I Timothy 2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all submission: but I permit not a woman to teach,
I Timothy 2:12 nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be silent.
I Timothy 2:13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
I Timothy 2:14 And Adam was not seduced <transChange>by the serpent,</transChange> but the woman being led astray was <transChange>first</transChange> in the transgression.

I Timothy 3:1 <transChange>It is</transChange> certain, if any one is desirous of the episcopal office, he desireth a good work.
I Timothy 3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of <transChange>but</transChange> one wife, sober, prudent, grave,
I Timothy 3:3 hospitable, able to teach, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of sordid gain, moderate, not quarrelsome,
I Timothy 3:4 not covetous, governing his own family well, having his children in subjection with all gravity;

I Timothy 3:6 not one newly converted, least being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
I Timothy 3:7 He ought also to have an honorable testimony from those that are without, least he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
I Timothy 3:8 The deacons <transChange>should</transChange> likewise <transChange>be</transChange> grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of base gain,
I Timothy 3:9 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
I Timothy 3:10 (And let these also first be proved, then let them take the office of deacons, if they be <transChange>found</transChange> blameless.)

I Timothy 3:12 Let the deacons <transChange>too</transChange> be husbands of one wife <transChange>only,</transChange> governing their children and their own houses well.
I Timothy 3:13 For they, that discharge the office of a deacon well, gain to themselves a good degree <transChange>of honor,</transChange> and much freedom in <transChange>promoting</transChange> the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
I Timothy 3:14 These things I write unto thee, hoping to come to thee shortly.
I Timothy 3:15 But if I <transChange>should</transChange> be retarded, that thou mayst know how thou oughtest to behave in the house of God, the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
I Timothy 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in <transChange>the</transChange> flesh, justified in <transChange>the</transChange> Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, <transChange>and</transChange> received up into glory. <chapter eID="gen6795" osisID="1Tim.3"/>

I Timothy 4:3 <transChange>and enjoining</transChange> abstinence from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by those that believe and know the truth.
I Timothy 4:4 For every creature of God <transChange>is</transChange> good, and nothing to be rejected, if <transChange>it be</transChange> received with thanksgiving:
I Timothy 4:5 for it is sanctified by the word of God and <transChange>by</transChange> prayer.
I Timothy 4:6 If thou lay these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, <transChange>as one</transChange> brought up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, to which thou hast attained.
I Timothy 4:7 But profane and groundless fables reject, and exercise thyself unto godliness.
I Timothy 4:8 For bodily exercise profiteth little, but piety is profitable unto all <transChange>things,</transChange> having <transChange>the</transChange> promise of the life <transChange>that</transChange> now <transChange>is,</transChange> and of that <transChange>which is</transChange> to come:
I Timothy 4:9 <transChange>this</transChange> is a certain truth and worthy of all acceptance.
I Timothy 4:10 For to this <transChange>end</transChange> we both labour and suffer reproach, because we have hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.
I Timothy 4:11 These <transChange>things</transChange> declare and teach.
I Timothy 4:12 Let no one <transChange>have cause to</transChange> despise thy youth; but he <transChange>thou</transChange> an example to believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
I Timothy 4:13 Till I come attend to reading, to exhortation, <transChange>and</transChange> teaching.
I Timothy 4:14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
I Timothy 4:15 Meditate on these <transChange>things,</transChange> be <transChange>wholly</transChange> in them, that thy proficiency may be manifest in all.
I Timothy 4:16 Take heed to thyself, and to <transChange>thy</transChange> doctrine; continue in them: for <transChange>in</transChange> doing this, thou wilt both save thyself and those that hear thee. <chapter eID="gen6812" osisID="1Tim.4"/>

I Timothy 5:1 Do not chide a senior, but exhort <transChange>him</transChange> as a father; and younger <transChange>men</transChange> as brethren:
I Timothy 5:2 <transChange>the</transChange> elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.
I Timothy 5:3 Honour widows who are widows indeed.
I Timothy 5:4 But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let <transChange>these</transChange> learn first to shew piety at home, and to make suitable returns to <transChange>their</transChange> parents: for this is becoming, and acceptable in the sight of God.
I Timothy 5:5 Now she, that is really a widow and desolate, hopeth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
I Timothy 5:6 But she that indulgeth to luxury, is dead while she liveth.
I Timothy 5:7 These <transChange>things</transChange> give in charge, that they may be blameless.
I Timothy 5:8 But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own family, he hath renounced the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
I Timothy 5:9 Let not a widow be chosen into the number under sixty years old,
I Timothy 5:10 having been the wife of one man: in repute for good actions, if she have educated children, if she have entertained strangers, if she have washed the feet of saints, if she have relieved the afflicted, and diligently followed every good work.
I Timothy 5:11 But the younger widows refuse: for when they grow wanton against Christ, they will <transChange>needs</transChange> marry:
I Timothy 5:12 and are <transChange>therefore</transChange> to be condemned, because they violate their first faith.
I Timothy 5:13 And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and <transChange>are</transChange> not only idle, but tatlers also and busy-bodies, talking of <transChange>things</transChange> unbecoming <transChange>them.</transChange>
I Timothy 5:14 I would therefore have the younger <transChange>widows</transChange> marry, bear children, manage houshold affairs, <transChange>and</transChange> give no occasion to the adversary for reproach.
I Timothy 5:15 For some are already turned aside after Satan.
I Timothy 5:16 <transChange>And</transChange> if any believer have <transChange>relations</transChange> widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve those that are indeed widows <transChange>and desolate.</transChange>
I Timothy 5:17 Let the elders, who preside well, be counted worthy of double honor, especially those that labour in preaching and teaching.

I Timothy 5:19 Receive not an accusation against an elder, unless from two or three witnesses.
I Timothy 5:20 Those that offend reprove before all, that others also may fear.
I Timothy 5:21 I charge <transChange>thee</transChange> before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou keep to these <transChange>things</transChange> without preference <transChange>of persons,</transChange> doing nothing with partiality.
I Timothy 5:22 Lay hands on no <transChange>man</transChange> precipitately, and be not <transChange>hereby</transChange> a partaker in the sins of others. Keep thyself pure.
I Timothy 5:23 Drink no longer water <transChange>only,</transChange> but use a little wine <transChange>with it,</transChange> for the sake of thy stomach and thy frequent infirmities.
I Timothy 5:24 The sins of some men are notorious, leading <transChange>as it were</transChange> to <transChange>their</transChange> condemnation; and some <transChange>more artful</transChange> they follow after.
I Timothy 5:25 So also the good works <transChange>of some</transChange> are manifest; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. <chapter eID="gen6829" osisID="1Tim.5"/>

I Timothy 6:1 Let as many as are servants under the yoke account their own masters worthy of all honor; that the name of God and <transChange>his</transChange> doctrine may not be blasphemed:
I Timothy 6:2 and let not those who have believing masters, despise <transChange>them,</transChange> because they are brethren; but serve <transChange>them</transChange> more <transChange>readily,</transChange> because they are faithful and beloved <transChange>by God,</transChange> partakers of <transChange>his</transChange> grace.
I Timothy 6:3 These <transChange>things</transChange> teach and exhort. If any one teach otherwise, and adhere not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness;
I Timothy 6:4 he is proud, knowing nothing, but <transChange>is</transChange> delirious about questions and strifes of words: from which cometh envy, contention, calumnies, wicked suspicions, perverse debates of men corrupted in mind,
I Timothy 6:5 and void of truth, accounting gain to be godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
I Timothy 6:6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
I Timothy 6:7 For we brought nothing into the world, <transChange>and</transChange> it is certain that we can carry nothing out:
I Timothy 6:8 having therefore food and raiment, let us be herewith content.
I Timothy 6:9 But they, that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and <transChange>into</transChange> many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into ruin and perdition.
I Timothy 6:10 For the love of money is the root of all evils, which some coveting after have been led astray from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
I Timothy 6:11 But do thou, O man of God, flee these <transChange>things,</transChange> and follow after righteousness, piety, fidelity, love, patience, meekness.
I Timothy 6:12 Maintain the glorious combat of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou hast been called, and hast made a good profession before many witnesses.
I Timothy 6:13 I charge thee before God, who giveth life to all, and <transChange>before</transChange> Christ Jesus who witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pilate,
I Timothy 6:14 that thou keep <transChange>this</transChange> commandment, unspotted and blameless, till the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ;
I Timothy 6:15 which He will manifest in his own times, <transChange>who</transChange> is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,
I Timothy 6:16 who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom <transChange>be</transChange> honor and power everlasting. Amen.
I Timothy 6:17 Charge them, that are rich in this world, not to be high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly affords us all <transChange>things</transChange> for enjoyment: <transChange>charge them</transChange> to do good,
I Timothy 6:18 to be rich in good works, to be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
I Timothy 6:19 treasuring up to themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may obtain eternal life.
I Timothy 6:20 O Timothy, keep that with which thou art entrusted, avoiding profane empty babblings, and the oppositions of science falsely so called:
I Timothy 6:21 which some pretending to, have erred from the faith. Grace <transChange>be</transChange> with thee. Amen. <chapter eID="gen6855" osisID="1Tim.6"/> <div eID="gen6757" osisID="1Tim" type="book"/>

II Timothy 1:3 I give thanks to God, whom I serve as <transChange>my</transChange> forefathers <transChange>did,</transChange> with a pure conscience, having remembrance of thee continually in my prayers night and day;
II Timothy 1:4 greatly desiring to see thee, (for I remember thy tears,) that I may be filled with joy:
II Timothy 1:5 keeping in memory the unfeigned faith, <transChange>that is</transChange> in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice: and I am persuaded that <transChange>it dwells</transChange> in thee also;
II Timothy 1:6 for which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God which is in thee through the imposition of my hands.
II Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but of vigor, and of love, and of prudence.
II Timothy 1:8 Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but bear <transChange>thy</transChange> part in the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God;
II Timothy 1:9 who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose, and grace bestowed upon us through Christ Jesus, before the world was,
II Timothy 1:10 but now made manifest by the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light by the gospel: for which I was appointed an herald,
II Timothy 1:11 and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles:
II Timothy 1:12 for which cause also I suffer these <transChange>things;</transChange> but I am not ashamed: for I know <transChange>in</transChange> whom I have trusted, and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him against that day.
II Timothy 1:13 Hold <transChange>fast</transChange> the form of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love <transChange>which is</transChange> in Christ Jesus.

II Timothy 1:15 Thou knowest that all those of Asia are turned from me, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes.
II Timothy 1:16 The Lord shew mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but when he was at Rome,
II Timothy 1:17 he sought for me <transChange>the</transChange> more diligently, and found <transChange>me.</transChange>
II Timothy 1:18 (The Lord grant that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day!) And how much he ministered <transChange>to me</transChange> at Ephesus <transChange>too,</transChange> thou knowest full well. <chapter eID="gen6878" osisID="2Tim.1"/>

II Timothy 2:3 Do thou therefore endure hardship, as <transChange>becomes</transChange> a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
II Timothy 2:4 No one, that enters into military service, embarrasseth himself with the affairs of <transChange>this</transChange> life, that he may please him who enlisted <transChange>him.</transChange>
II Timothy 2:5 And if any one contend <transChange>in the public games,</transChange> he gains not the crown unless he contend fairly.

II Timothy 2:7 Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all <transChange>things.</transChange>
II Timothy 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ of the seed of David, <transChange>who was</transChange> raised from the dead, according to my gospel:
II Timothy 2:9 for whose sake I suffer trouble <transChange>even</transChange> unto bonds, as <transChange>if I were</transChange> a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
II Timothy 2:10 Therefore I submit to every <transChange>thing</transChange> for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is by Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
II Timothy 2:11 <transChange>It is</transChange> an undoubted truth, if we are dead with <transChange>Him,</transChange> we shall also live with <transChange>Him:</transChange>
II Timothy 2:12 if we suffer, we shall also reign with <transChange>Him:</transChange> if we disown <transChange>Him,</transChange> He will also disown us.
II Timothy 2:13 If we are unfaithful, He continueth faithful <transChange>notwithstanding;</transChange> He cannot renounce Himself.
II Timothy 2:14 These <transChange>things</transChange> remind <transChange>them</transChange> of, charging <transChange>them</transChange> before the Lord not to contend about words, <transChange>which is</transChange> profitable for nothing, <transChange>and tends</transChange> to the subversion of the hearers.
II Timothy 2:15 Endeavour to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
II Timothy 2:16 But avoid prophane empty harangues; for they will proceed to more impiety,
II Timothy 2:17 and their discourse will eat like a gangrene. Of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus; who have erred from the truth,
II Timothy 2:18 saying that the resurrection is already past; and subvert the faith of some.
II Timothy 2:19 However, the foundation of God standeth firm, having this inscription, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
II Timothy 2:20 In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, some for meaner uses.
II Timothy 2:21 If therefore any one purify himself from these <transChange>corruptions,</transChange> he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and fitted for the Master's use, being prepared for every good work.
II Timothy 2:22 Flee youthful passions: and follow righteousness, fidelity, love, <transChange>and</transChange> peace, with <transChange>all</transChange> those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart:
II Timothy 2:23 but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they produce quarrels; for the servant of the Lord ought not to wrangle,

II Timothy 2:25 with meekness instructing those of different sentiments, not <transChange>knowing</transChange> but God may give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth;

II Timothy 3:4 headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

II Timothy 3:6 For of these are they who insinuate themselves into families, and captivate weak women, that are laden with sins,
II Timothy 3:7 <transChange>and</transChange> led <transChange>away</transChange> by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
II Timothy 3:8 And as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; <transChange>being</transChange> men of corrupt minds, and of no judgement in the faith.
II Timothy 3:9 But they shall not proceed far: for their folly shall be evident to all, as theirs also was.
II Timothy 3:10 But thou art well acquainted with my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience, persecutions,
II Timothy 3:11 sufferings, which befel me at Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and <transChange>how</transChange> the Lord delivered me out of them all.

II Timothy 3:15 and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus: <transChange>for</transChange> all scripture <transChange>is</transChange> by inspiration from God,

II Timothy 4:3 For the time will come, when they will not bear sound doctrine; but having itching ears, will heap up to themselves teachers after their own hearts:
II Timothy 4:4 and turn away their attention from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.
II Timothy 4:5 But be thou watchful in all <transChange>things,</transChange> endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, give full proof of thy ministry.
II Timothy 4:6 For I am now <transChange>going to be</transChange> sacrificed, and the time of my dissolution is near.

II Timothy 4:8 <transChange>As to</transChange> what remains, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me in that day: and not to me only, but also to all <transChange>those</transChange> who have longed for his appearance.
II Timothy 4:9 Endeavour to come to me soon: for Demas hath forsaken me,
II Timothy 4:10 through love of this world, and is gone to Thessalonica; <transChange>as is</transChange> Crescens to Galatia, <transChange>and</transChange> Titus to Dalmatia: Luke only is with me.
II Timothy 4:11 Take Mark, and bring <transChange>him</transChange> with thee: for he is useful to me in the ministry.
II Timothy 4:12 And I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
II Timothy 4:13 When thou comest, bring <transChange>with thee</transChange> the cloke, that I left at Troas with Carpus; and the books, <transChange>but</transChange> especially the parchments.

Titus 1:1 <hi type="bold">Paul</hi> a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for <transChange>promoting</transChange> the faith of God's chosen <transChange>people,</transChange> and the knowledge of the truth which <transChange>is</transChange> according to godliness:
Titus 1:2 in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before all ages;
Titus 1:3 and hath in his own times manifested his word, by the preaching, with which I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour:
Titus 1:4 to Titus <transChange>my</transChange> son in the common faith, grace, mercy, <transChange>and</transChange> peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
Titus 1:5 For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest set in order what remained, and ordain elders in every city as I directed thee:
Titus 1:6 <transChange>to wit,</transChange> if any <transChange>one</transChange> be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of debauchery, or unruly.
Titus 1:7 For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God, not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of sordid gain:
Titus 1:8 but hospitable, benevolent, sober, just, holy, temperate;
Titus 1:9 holding fast the faithful word, according as he hath been taught, that he may be able both to instruct in sound doctrine, and to convince gainsayers.
Titus 1:10 For there are many disorderly <transChange>persons,</transChange> vain-talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision; whose mouths must be stopped:
Titus 1:11 who subvert whole families, teaching what they ought not, for shameful gain:
Titus 1:12 <transChange>as</transChange> said one of themselves, a prophet of their own, "The Cretans <transChange>are</transChange> always liars, mischievous beasts, sluggish gluttons."
Titus 1:13 This testimony is true: for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be found in the faith;
Titus 1:14 not attending to Jewish fables, and the precepts of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus 1:15 To the pure indeed all things <transChange>are</transChange> pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing <transChange>is</transChange> pure; even their mind and conscience is polluted.
Titus 1:16 They profess to know God, but in works deny <transChange>Him,</transChange> being abominable and disobedient, and to every thing <transChange>that is</transChange> good void of understanding. <chapter eID="gen6966" osisID="Titus.1"/>
Titus 2:0 <chapter osisID="Titus.2" sID="gen6983"/>
Titus 2:1 But do thou speak <transChange>the things</transChange> which become sound doctrine:
Titus 2:2 that aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in the faith, in love, in patience:
Titus 2:3 the aged women likewise in behaviour as becometh saints, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
Titus 2:4 that they may instruct the young women to be temperate, to love their husbands, to love their children, <transChange>to be</transChange> prudent,
Titus 2:5 chaste, keepers at home, good, submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.
Titus 2:6 Exhort the young men in like manner to be temperate:
Titus 2:7 in all <transChange>things</transChange> shewing thyself a pattern of good works, <transChange>with</transChange> uncorruptness in teaching, gravity, sound doctrine that cannot be condemned;
Titus 2:8 that he who opposeth <transChange>it</transChange> may be ashamed, having no evil to say of you.
Titus 2:9 <transChange>Exhort</transChange> servants to submit to their masters, to be obsequious in all <transChange>things,</transChange>
Titus 2:10 not answering frowardly, not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all <transChange>things.</transChange>
Titus 2:11 For the grace of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men;
Titus 2:12 teaching us that denying ungodliness, and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and righteously, and piously in this present world;
Titus 2:13 looking for the blessed hope, and glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour, Jesus Christ:
Titus 2:14 who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
Titus 2:15 These <transChange>things</transChange> speak, and exhort; and reprove <transChange>offenders</transChange> with all authority: that none <transChange>may</transChange> despise thee. <chapter eID="gen6983" osisID="Titus.2"/>

Titus 3:1 Admonish them to be submissive to governors and magistrates, to obey <transChange>their</transChange> orders, <transChange>and</transChange> to be ready to every good work;
Titus 3:2 to slander no <transChange>man,</transChange> to avoid contention, <transChange>to be</transChange> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
Titus 3:3 For we also were formerly foolish, disobedient, going astray, enslaved to various <transChange>disorderly</transChange> appetites and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <transChange>and</transChange> hating one another.
Titus 3:4 But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared,
Titus 3:5 not for works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his <transChange>own</transChange> mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Spirit;
Titus 3:6 which He hath plentifully shed upon us, through Jesus Christ our Saviour:
Titus 3:7 that being justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus 3:8 <transChange>This is</transChange> a word <transChange>which ought</transChange> to believed <transChange>and observed,</transChange> and concerning these things I would have thee stedfastly affirm, that they who have believed in God be careful to excel in good works: <transChange>for</transChange> these <transChange>things</transChange> are good and profitable to men.
Titus 3:9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes and contentions about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain:
Titus 3:10 reject <transChange>therefore such</transChange> an heretical man, after the first and second admonition; knowing that such a one is perverted,
Titus 3:11 and sinneth <transChange>as</transChange> being self-condemned.
Titus 3:12 When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, endeavour to come to me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
Titus 3:13 Forward Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, on their journey carefully, that nothing may be wanting to them.
Titus 3:14 And let our <transChange>brethren</transChange>-also learn to excel in good works for necessary exigencies, that they may not be unfruitful.
Titus 3:15 All <transChange>that are</transChange> with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in <transChange>the</transChange> faith. Grace <transChange>be</transChange> with you all. Amen. <chapter eID="gen6999" osisID="Titus.3"/> <div eID="gen6965" osisID="Titus" type="book"/>

Philemon 1:5 (hearing of the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and of thy love to all the saints,)
Philemon 1:6 that the communication of thy faith may become effectual in the acknowledgement of all the good that is in you towards Christ Jesus:

Philemon 1:10 I intreat thee <transChange>then</transChange> for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,

Philemon 1:18 If he hath wronged thee in any <transChange>thing,</transChange> or is indebted <transChange>to thee,</transChange> place it to my accompt:
Philemon 1:19 I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will pay <transChange>it:</transChange> not to say that thou indeed owest even thy own self to me.
Philemon 1:20 Yea, <transChange>my</transChange> brother, let me enjoy <transChange>this</transChange> satisfaction from thee in the Lord: <transChange>and thus</transChange> refresh my bowels in the Lord.
Philemon 1:21 Being <transChange>fully</transChange> persuaded of thy compliance, I have written to thee; knowing that thou wilt indeed do more than I ask.

Hebrews 1:1 <hi type="bold">God</hi>, who at sundry times, and various ways, spake of old unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by <transChange>his</transChange> Son,
Hebrews 1:2 whom He hath appointed heir of all <transChange>things,</transChange> by whom also He made the worlds.
Hebrews 1:3 Who being the refulgence of <transChange>his</transChange> glory and the imprest image of his person, and sustaining all <transChange>things</transChange> by his powerful word, having by Himself performed the purging away of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.
Hebrews 1:4 Being as much superior to the angels, as He inheriteth a name more excellent than they.
Hebrews 1:5 For to which of the angels did He ever say, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?" and again, "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to me a Son?"
Hebrews 1:6 and when He again introduceth the First-born into the world, he saith, "And let all the angels of God worship Him."
Hebrews 1:7 And <transChange>as</transChange> to the angels He saith, "Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire:"
Hebrews 1:8 but to the Son, "Thy throne, O God, <transChange>is</transChange> for ever and ever; the sceptre of thy kingdom <transChange>is</transChange> a sceptre of righteousness:
Hebrews 1:9 thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity; therefore God, <transChange>even</transChange> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thine associates."
Hebrews 1:10 And <transChange>in another place,</transChange> "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands:
Hebrews 1:11 they <transChange>shall</transChange> perish, but thou remainest; and they shall all grow old as a garment,
Hebrews 1:12 and as a mantle wilt thou fold them <transChange>up,</transChange> and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."
Hebrews 1:13 But to which of the angels hath He ever said, "Sit <transChange>thou</transChange> at my right hand, till I make thine enemies <transChange>thy</transChange> footstool?"
Hebrews 1:14 Are they not all ministring spirits, sent forth to attend on those who shall be heirs of salvation? <chapter eID="gen7043" osisID="Heb.1"/>
Hebrews 2:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.2" sID="gen7058"/>
Hebrews 2:1 For this <transChange>reason</transChange> we ought the more earnestly to attend to what we have heard, least by any means we should be <transChange>found</transChange> deficient.
Hebrews 2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received <transChange>it's</transChange> just recompence;
Hebrews 2:3 how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which began to be declared by the Lord, <transChange>and</transChange> was confirmed to us by them that heard <transChange>Him;</transChange>
Hebrews 2:4 God also testifying together with <transChange>them</transChange> by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Spirit, according to his own will.
Hebrews 2:5 For He hath not subjected to angels the world to come, of which we speak.
Hebrews 2:6 But one in a certain place hath testified, saying, "What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest Him?
Hebrews 2:7 Thou madest Him <transChange>for</transChange> a little <transChange>while</transChange> inferior to <transChange>the</transChange> angels; with glory and honor hast thou crowned Him, and hast set Him over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all <transChange>things</transChange> under his feet,"
Hebrews 2:8 For in putting all things under Him, He left nothing <transChange>which was</transChange> not <transChange>to be</transChange> in subjection to Him: though we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.
Hebrews 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made <transChange>for</transChange> a little <transChange>while</transChange> lower than the angels, in order to suffer death, that by the grace of God He might taste death for every man, crowned with glory and honor.
Hebrews 2:10 For it became Him for whom are all <transChange>things,</transChange> and by whom <transChange>are</transChange> all things, <transChange>in</transChange> bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect by sufferings:
Hebrews 2:11 since He that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, <transChange>are</transChange> all of one. For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren,
Hebrews 2:12 saying, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee."
Hebrews 2:13 And again, "I will trust in Him:" and again, "Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me."
Hebrews 2:14 Seeing then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also himself in like manner partook of them; that by death He might destroy him that had the empire of death, that is, the devil:
Hebrews 2:15 and deliver those who through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage.
Hebrews 2:16 For indeed He taketh not hold of angels <transChange>to save them,</transChange> but of the seed of Abraham.
Hebrews 2:17 Whence it behoved Him to be made in all things like unto <transChange>his</transChange> brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful high-priest in the <transChange>things</transChange> concerning God, to make atonement for the sins of the people:
Hebrews 2:18 for as He himself hath suffered, <transChange>in</transChange> being tempted, He is able to succour those that are tempted. <chapter eID="gen7058" osisID="Heb.2"/>
Hebrews 3:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.3" sID="gen7077"/>
Hebrews 3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high-priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
Hebrews 3:2 who was faithful to Him that appointed Him, as Moses also <transChange>was</transChange> in all his house.
Hebrews 3:3 For He was accounted worthy of more honor than Moses, as he who hath built it, hath more honor than the house.
Hebrews 3:4 For every house is built by some <transChange>one:</transChange> and He who built all <transChange>things is</transChange> God.
Hebrews 3:5 Now Moses <transChange>was</transChange> indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of the things which were to be spoken:
Hebrews 3:6 but Christ as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we maintain the free profession and exultation of hope firm unto the end.
Hebrews 3:7 Therefore, as the holy Ghost saith, "To-day if ye will hear his voice,
Hebrews 3:8 harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers tempted me,
Hebrews 3:9 proved me, and saw my works forty years:
Hebrews 3:10 wherefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, They are always erring in <transChange>their</transChange> heart, and they have not known my ways:
Hebrews 3:11 so I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest."
Hebrews 3:12 Take heed, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, least there be in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief in departing from the living God:
Hebrews 3:13 but exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day; that none of you may be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin:
Hebrews 3:14 for we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold fast our first confidence firm unto the end; inasmuch as it is said,
Hebrews 3:15 "To-day if ye will hear his voice,
Hebrews 3:16 harden not your hearts, as in the provocation." For some that heard did provoke; but not all that came out of Egypt with Moses.
Hebrews 3:17 But with whom was He provoked forty years? <transChange>was it</transChange> not with those that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews 3:18 and to whom did He swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those that were disobedient?
Hebrews 3:19 and <transChange>so</transChange> we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. <chapter eID="gen7077" osisID="Heb.3"/>
Hebrews 4:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.4" sID="gen7097"/>
Hebrews 4:1 Let us therefore fear least a promise being left <transChange>us</transChange> of entering into his rest, any of us should seem to fall short of it:
Hebrews 4:2 for we are graciously offered <transChange>it,</transChange> as they also were. But the word, which they heard, did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <transChange>it.</transChange>
Hebrews 4:3 For we who believe shall enter into rest, as He said <transChange>above,</transChange> "So I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest:" though the works <transChange>of creation</transChange> were finished from the foundation of the world:
Hebrews 4:4 for it is thus said concerning the seventh <transChange>day,</transChange> "And God rested the seventh day from all his works."
Hebrews 4:5 And yet in this <transChange>place,</transChange> "They shall not enter into my rest."
Hebrews 4:6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some <transChange>are to</transChange> enter into it, and they to whom it was at first offered did not enter because of <transChange>their</transChange> unbelief,
Hebrews 4:7 He appoints a certain day, <transChange>called</transChange> To-day, saying by David so long after, (as it is recorded) "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
Hebrews 4:8 For if Joshua had given them <transChange>the</transChange> rest, He would not afterwards have spoken of another day.
Hebrews 4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God:
Hebrews 4:10 for he that is entered into his rest, hath also himself ceased from his works, as God <transChange>did</transChange> from his.
Hebrews 4:11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, least any one fall after the same example of unbelief.
Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is lively and efficacious, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the <transChange>very</transChange> joints and marrow, and judging the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
Hebrews 4:13 And there is no creature concealed from his sight: but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him, to whom we are to <transChange>give an</transChange> account.
Hebrews 4:14 Having therefore a great high-priest, that is passed <transChange>into</transChange> the heavens, <transChange>even</transChange> Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <transChange>our</transChange> profession:
Hebrews 4:15 for we have not an high-priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities, but was in all <transChange>respects</transChange> tempted in like manner <transChange>with us, yet</transChange> without sin.
Hebrews 4:16 Let us therefore come with freedom to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace for <transChange>our</transChange> seasonable help. <chapter eID="gen7097" osisID="Heb.4"/>
Hebrews 5:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.5" sID="gen7114"/>
Hebrews 5:1 For every high-priest taken from among men, is appointed for <transChange>the sake of</transChange> men in things relating to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:
Hebrews 5:2 who can have due compassion on the ignorant and those that are going astray; seeing he himself also is surrounded with infirmity:
Hebrews 5:3 and for this <transChange>reason</transChange> he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer <transChange>sacrifice</transChange> for sins.
Hebrews 5:4 And no one taketh this honor to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron <transChange>was.</transChange>
Hebrews 5:5 So also Christ did not glorify himself to be made an high-priest; but He that said unto Him, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
Hebrews 5:6 As He saith also in another <transChange>place,</transChange> "Thou <transChange>art</transChange> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
Hebrews 5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, offered prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, to Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard in what He feared;
Hebrews 5:8 <transChange>but</transChange> though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered: and being <transChange>thus</transChange> perfected,
Hebrews 5:9 He became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey Him:
Hebrews 5:10 having been declared by God an high-priest after the order of Melchisedec.
Hebrews 5:11 Concerning whom we have much to say and difficult to be explained, since ye are become dull of hearing.
Hebrews 5:12 For whereas ye ought for the time to be teachers <transChange>of others,</transChange> ye have need again of some <transChange>one</transChange> to teach you the first rudiments of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk and not of solid food.
Hebrews 5:13 For every one that wanteth milk, is unacquainted with the doctrine of justification; for he is an infant:
Hebrews 5:14 but firm food is for persons come to age, who by habit have <transChange>their</transChange> senses exercised to a discernment both of good and evil. <chapter eID="gen7114" osisID="Heb.5"/>
Hebrews 6:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.6" sID="gen7129"/>
Hebrews 6:1 Wherefore omitting the discourse about the first principles <transChange>of the doctrine</transChange> of Christ, let us proceed to perfection: not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works,
Hebrews 6:2 and of faith in God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands, and of <transChange>the</transChange> resurrection from the dead, and of eternal judgement: (<transChange>tho'</transChange> we will do this also, if God permit:)
Hebrews 6:3 for <transChange>it is</transChange> impossible that those,
Hebrews 6:4 who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Spirit,
Hebrews 6:5 and of the good word of God,
Hebrews 6:6 and the powers of the gospel-age, and <transChange>yet</transChange> fall away, should be renewed again to repentance: since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God, and make an <transChange>open</transChange> example <transChange>of Him.</transChange>
Hebrews 6:7 For <transChange>as</transChange> the earth, which imbibeth the rain that is frequently coming upon it, and produceth herbs fit for those by whom it is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God:
Hebrews 6:8 but that which bringeth forth thorns and briars, <transChange>is</transChange> rejected and near to a curse, (whose end <transChange>is</transChange> burning) <transChange>so are they.</transChange>
Hebrews 6:9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better <transChange>things</transChange> of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak <transChange>for your caution.</transChange>
Hebrews 6:10 For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have shewn to his name, <transChange>by</transChange> having ministred to the saints, and <transChange>yet</transChange> ministring.
Hebrews 6:11 And we desire that every one of you would shew the same diligence to <transChange>acquire</transChange> the full assurance of hope <transChange>even</transChange> unto the end:
Hebrews 6:12 that ye would not be sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.
Hebrews 6:13 For when God made the promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, saying,
Hebrews 6:14 "Verily blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."
Hebrews 6:15 And thus waiting patiently he obtained the promise.
Hebrews 6:16 For men swear by a greater <transChange>Being,</transChange> and an oath for confirmation <transChange>is</transChange> to them an end of all controversy.
Hebrews 6:17 Wherefore God being willing more abundantly to manifest unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed <transChange>it</transChange> with an oath:
Hebrews 6:18 that by two immutable things, in which <transChange>it is</transChange> impossible for God to fail, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us;
Hebrews 6:19 which we have as an anchor of the soul safe and stedfast, and which entereth within the veil.
Hebrews 6:20 Whither Jesus <transChange>our</transChange> fore-runner is entered for us, being made an high-priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec. <chapter eID="gen7129" osisID="Heb.6"/>
Hebrews 7:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.7" sID="gen7150"/>
Hebrews 7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings,
Hebrews 7:2 and blessed him, to whom also Abraham divided the tenth of all <transChange>his spoils;</transChange> being in the first place, by interpretation <transChange>of his name,</transChange> king of righteousness, and moreover king of Salem, which is king of peace;
Hebrews 7:3 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days <transChange>recorded,</transChange> nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, remaineth a priest continually.
Hebrews 7:4 Now consider how great a man this <transChange>was,</transChange> to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
Hebrews 7:5 And those indeed of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment according to the law to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brethren, though they came out of the loins of Abraham:
Hebrews 7:6 but he, whose pedigree is not reckoned among them, took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
Hebrews 7:7 Now without all contradiction the inferior is blessed by the superior:
Hebrews 7:8 besides, here men that die receive tithes; but there he of whom it is testified that he liveth.
Hebrews 7:9 And (as one may say) even Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:
Hebrews 7:10 for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
Hebrews 7:11 Now if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law) what farther need <transChange>was there</transChange> that another priest should arise after the order of Melchisedec, and not after the order of Aaron?
Hebrews 7:12 For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change also of the law.
Hebrews 7:13 Now He, of whom these things are said, is of another tribe, of which none <transChange>ever</transChange> attended at the altar..
Hebrews 7:14 For <transChange>it is</transChange> evident that our Lord sprang from Judah, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing about <transChange>the</transChange> priesthood.
Hebrews 7:15 And it is yet more abundantly evident, that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
Hebrews 7:16 who is made not according to the law of a temporary command, but according to the power of an endless life.
Hebrews 7:17 For He testifieth, Thou <transChange>art</transChange> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
Hebrews 7:18 For there is indeed a disannulling of the preceding command, on account of it's weakness and unprofitableness;
Hebrews 7:19 for the law made nothing perfect, but the introducing of a better hope <transChange>did,</transChange> by which we draw near to God.
Hebrews 7:20 Moreover inasmuch as <transChange>He was</transChange> not <transChange>made priest</transChange> without an oath,
Hebrews 7:21 (for they indeed are become priests without <transChange>the solemnity of</transChange> an oath; but He with an oath, by Him who said unto Him, "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <transChange>art</transChange> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:")
Hebrews 7:22 by so much is Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
Hebrews 7:23 And they were many priests, because they were by death hindered from continuing <transChange>in their office;</transChange>
Hebrews 7:24 but He, because He abideth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not <transChange>to any other:</transChange>
Hebrews 7:25 wherefore also He is able to save to the uttermost, those that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.
Hebrews 7:26 For such an high-priest was meet for us, <transChange>who was</transChange> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and higher than the heavens;
Hebrews 7:27 who hath no need, as the <transChange>Levitical</transChange> high-priests <transChange>had,</transChange> daily to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, <transChange>and</transChange> then for those of the people: for this He did once <transChange>for all,</transChange> in offering up Himself.
Hebrews 7:28 For the law appointeth men high-priests, who have infirmity; but the oath, <transChange>recorded</transChange> since the law, <transChange>appointeth</transChange> the Son <transChange>to be priest</transChange> for ever, being <transChange>fully</transChange> perfected <transChange>for it.</transChange> <chapter eID="gen7150" osisID="Heb.7"/>
Hebrews 8:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.8" sID="gen7179"/>
Hebrews 8:1 Now the sum of the things that have been said <transChange>is this, that</transChange> we have such an high-priest, who is sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens;
Hebrews 8:2 a minister of holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath raised, and not man.
Hebrews 8:3 For every high-priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore <transChange>it was</transChange> necessary that He also should have something to offer.
Hebrews 8:4 For if He were on earth, He could not be a priest, seeing there are priests <transChange>already</transChange> that offer gifts according to the law:
Hebrews 8:5 who worship <transChange>under</transChange> the representation and shadow of heavenly things; as Moses was ordered by God, when he was about to finish the tabernacle. For see, saith He, <transChange>that</transChange> thou make all according to the model shewn thee in the mount.
Hebrews 8:6 But now He hath obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which is established upon better promises.
Hebrews 8:7 For if the first <transChange>covenant</transChange> had been unexceptionable, there had been no room for a second:
Hebrews 8:8 <transChange>as we see there was,</transChange> for <transChange>after</transChange> complaining of them, He adds, "Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
Hebrews 8:9 not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
Hebrews 8:10 But this <transChange>is</transChange> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their mind, and I will inscribe them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
Hebrews 8:11 And they shall not teach every one his neighbour, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the lest even to the greatest of them.
Hebrews 8:12 For I will forgive their crimes, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."
Hebrews 8:13 <transChange>Now</transChange> by saying, a new <transChange>covenant,</transChange> He hath antiquated the first: and what is antiquated, and groweth old, <transChange>is</transChange> near <transChange>it's</transChange> exit. <chapter eID="gen7179" osisID="Heb.8"/>
Hebrews 9:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.9" sID="gen7193"/>
Hebrews 9:1 Therefore the first covenant had also rites of worship and a worldly sanctuary.
Hebrews 9:2 For there was a tabernacle prepared; the first <transChange>part,</transChange> wherein <transChange>was</transChange> the candlestick, and the table, and the loaves set on <transChange>it,</transChange> which is called the sanctuary.
Hebrews 9:3 And beyond the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies, having the golden censer,
Hebrews 9:4 and the ark of the covenant <transChange>which was</transChange> overlaid all round with gold, <transChange>and</transChange> in which <transChange>was</transChange> the golden pot with the manna in it, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
Hebrews 9:5 and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat: of which it is not <transChange>necessary</transChange> now to speak particularly.
Hebrews 9:6 Now these things being thus disposed, the priests always went into the first <transChange>part of the</transChange> tabernacle to perform their <transChange>daily</transChange> services:
Hebrews 9:7 but into the second only the high-priest <transChange>went</transChange> once a year; <transChange>and that</transChange> not without blood, which he offered for himself, and <transChange>for</transChange> the sins of the people <transChange>committed</transChange> through ignorance.
Hebrews 9:8 The Holy Ghost shewing <transChange>by</transChange> this, that the way into the <transChange>Holy</transChange> of holies was not yet manifested, the first tabernacle being yet standing.
Hebrews 9:9 Which figure <transChange>remains</transChange> to the present time, wherein gifts and sacrifices are offered, that cannot perfect the worshipper as to <transChange>his</transChange> conscience,
Hebrews 9:10 <transChange>relating</transChange> only to meats and drinks, and different washings, and <transChange>such</transChange> carnal ordinances <transChange>as were</transChange> required till the time of reformation.
Hebrews 9:11 But Christ being come an high-priest of the good things to come, hath entered once for all into the holy <transChange>places,</transChange> through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this building,
Hebrews 9:12 nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption <transChange>for us.</transChange>
Hebrews 9:13 For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purification of the flesh;
Hebrews 9:14 how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works, that ye may serve the living God?
Hebrews 9:15 And on this account He is the mediator of a new covenant, that undergoing death for the redemption of transgressions against the first covenant, they that are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.
Hebrews 9:16 For where a testament <transChange>is,</transChange> there is a necessity of proving the death of the testator.
Hebrews 9:17 For a testament is valid after men are dead, but is of no force while the testator is living.
Hebrews 9:18 Whence neither was the first <transChange>covenant</transChange> entered into without blood:
Hebrews 9:19 for when every command was spoken according to the law, by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book and all the people,
Hebrews 9:20 saying, this is the blood of the covenant, which God hath enjoined you.
Hebrews 9:21 And the tabernacle, and all the vessels of public worship he likewise sprinkled with blood.
Hebrews 9:22 And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
Hebrews 9:23 <transChange>It was</transChange> therefore necessary that the representations of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with more excellent sacrifices than these.
Hebrews 9:24 For Christ is not entered into holy <transChange>places</transChange> made with hands, <transChange>which were but</transChange> types of the true <transChange>ones;</transChange> but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
Hebrews 9:25 nor to offer Himself often, as the high-priest entereth into the <transChange>holy of</transChange> holies every year with the blood of others;
Hebrews 9:26 (for then He must <transChange>indeed</transChange> have suffered often since the foundation of the world) but now once at the conclusion of the ages He hath been made manifest for the abolishing of sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews 9:27 And as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this the judgement;
Hebrews 9:28 so Christ, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear the second time without sin, to those who are waiting for Him, unto salvation. <chapter eID="gen7193" osisID="Heb.9"/>
Hebrews 10:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.10" sID="gen7222"/>
Hebrews 10:1 For the law having <transChange>but</transChange> a <transChange>faint</transChange> shadow of good <transChange>things</transChange> to come, <transChange>and</transChange> not the full image of the things, can never, even by the <transChange>great</transChange> annual sacrifices which they offer statedly, make the comers thereunto perfect.
Hebrews 10:2 For then they would have ceased to be offered, because the sacrificers, being once purified, would no longer retain any consciousness of sins.
Hebrews 10:3 Whereas in <transChange>these</transChange> very sacrifices there is a recalling of sins to mind every year.
Hebrews 10:4 For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Hebrews 10:5 Wherefore upon his coming into the world He saith, "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire, but a body hast thou prepared me:
Hebrews 10:6 in whole burnt-offerings and <transChange>sacrifices</transChange> for sin thou hadst no pleasure:
Hebrews 10:7 then said I, Lo I come, <transChange>as</transChange> in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God."
Hebrews 10:8 Having said before, "Thou didst not desire, nor hadst pleasure in, sacrifice and offering, and whole burnt-offerings, and <transChange>sacrifices</transChange> for sin," (which are offered by the law) then He adds,
Hebrews 10:9 "Lo I come to do thy will, O God." (He taketh away the first, that He may establish the second.)
Hebrews 10:10 By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews 10:11 And indeed every priest <transChange>under the law</transChange> standeth daily ministring, and frequently offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
Hebrews 10:12 but He having offered one sacrifice for sins, is for ever sat down at the right hand of God;
Hebrews 10:13 waiting for the future, till his enemies be put under his feet.
Hebrews 10:14 For by one offering He hath perfected for ever those that are sanctified.
Hebrews 10:15 And <transChange>of this</transChange> the holy Ghost also beareth witness with us:
Hebrews 10:16 for after He had said, "This <transChange>is</transChange> the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and on their minds will I inscribe them;
Hebrews 10:17 <transChange>He adds,</transChange> and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more."
Hebrews 10:18 Now where <transChange>there is such</transChange> a remission of these, there <transChange>needs</transChange> no more offering for sin.
Hebrews 10:19 Having therefore, brethren, free admission into the holy <transChange>places</transChange> by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews 10:20 the new and living way which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is <transChange>to say,</transChange>
Hebrews 10:21 his flesh, and <transChange>having</transChange> a great <transChange>high</transChange>-priest over the house of God,
Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near with sincerity, in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts cleansed from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
Hebrews 10:23 Let us inflexibly retain the profession of our hope,
Hebrews 10:24 (for He is faithful who hath promised) and let us observe each other to the incitement of love and good works:
Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking our assemblies, as the custom of some <transChange>is,</transChange> but exhorting <transChange>one another;</transChange> and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.
Hebrews 10:26 For if we sin wilfully after having received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins;
Hebrews 10:27 but a dreadful expectation of judgement, and a fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
Hebrews 10:28 <transChange>If</transChange> any <transChange>one</transChange> that violateth the law of Moses, dieth without mercy under two or three witnesses,
Hebrews 10:29 of how much greater punishment, think ye, shall he be counted worthy, who hath trampled under foot the Son of God, and accounted the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and abused the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews 10:30 For we know who hath said, "To me <transChange>belongeth</transChange> vengeance, I will recompense, saith the Lord:" and again, "The Lord will judge his people."
Hebrews 10:31 <transChange>It is</transChange> a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews 10:32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which <transChange>after</transChange> being enlightened, ye sustained a great conflict of sufferings;
Hebrews 10:33 partly, being made a public spectacle by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, as ye became associates of those who were so treated:
Hebrews 10:34 for ye sympathized with <transChange>me in</transChange> my bonds, and ye took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
Hebrews 10:35 Cast not away therefore your couragious profession, which hath a great recompence of reward.
Hebrews 10:36 For ye have need of patience, that having done the will of God ye may receive the promise.
Hebrews 10:37 For yet a little while, and He, that is coming, will come, and will not delay:
Hebrews 10:38 and the just shall live by faith, but if <transChange>any</transChange> draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
Hebrews 10:39 But we are not of those who withdraw to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. <chapter eID="gen7222" osisID="Heb.10"/>
Hebrews 11:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.11" sID="gen7262"/>
Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the confident expectation of <transChange>things</transChange> hoped for, and a conviction of things not seen:
Hebrews 11:2 for by it the ancients obtained an <transChange>honorable</transChange> testimony.
Hebrews 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, for the things which are seen were not made of things which appear.
Hebrews 11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God bearing witness to his gifts: and by it, though dead, he yet speaketh.
Hebrews 11:5 By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had <transChange>this</transChange> testimony that he pleased God:
Hebrews 11:6 whereas without faith <transChange>it is</transChange> impossible to please <transChange>Him;</transChange> for he that cometh to God must believe, that He is, and is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.
Hebrews 11:7 By faith Noah being warned by God of things <transChange>which were</transChange> not yet seen, moved with <transChange>pious</transChange> fear, prepared an ark for the safety of his family; whereby he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness <transChange>which is</transChange> by faith.
Hebrews 11:8 By faith Abraham <transChange>when</transChange> called to go out to a place which he was afterwards to receive for an inheritance obeyed: and went out, though he knew not whither he was going.
Hebrews 11:9 By faith he sojourned in the land promised <transChange>him,</transChange> as <transChange>in</transChange> a foreign <transChange>country,</transChange> dwelling in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob the heirs with <transChange>him</transChange> of the same promise.
Hebrews 11:10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose maker and founder <transChange>is</transChange> God.
Hebrews 11:11 By faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed, and brought forth <transChange>a son</transChange> when she was past age, because she accounted Him faithful who had promised.
Hebrews 11:12 So that there descended even from one, and him <transChange>in a manner</transChange> dead, <transChange>a posterity</transChange> like the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand on the sea shore, innumerable.
Hebrews 11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but seen them from afar, and been persuaded <transChange>of them,</transChange> and embraced <transChange>them,</transChange> and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.
Hebrews 11:14 Now they that say such things shew plainly that they are seeking <transChange>their own</transChange> country:
Hebrews 11:15 and if they had been mindful of that from which they came, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
Hebrews 11:16 But they desire a better, that is, an heavenly <transChange>one;</transChange> wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city.
Hebrews 11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he who had received the promises, offered up his only son;
Hebrews 11:18 of whom it was told <transChange>him,</transChange> that in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Hebrews 11:19 concluding that God was able to raise <transChange>him</transChange> even from the dead; from whence indeed he had in a manner received him.
Hebrews 11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things future.
Hebrews 11:21 By faith Jacob, <transChange>when he was</transChange> dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped <transChange>leaning</transChange> on the top of his staff.
Hebrews 11:22 By faith Joseph when he died, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel and gave a charge concerning his bones.
Hebrews 11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw <transChange>he was</transChange> a fine child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
Hebrews 11:24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
Hebrews 11:25 chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin:
Hebrews 11:26 esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he looked to the recompence of reward.
Hebrews 11:27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he continued firm as seeing Him who is invisible.
Hebrews 11:28 By faith he observed the passover and sprinkling of the blood, that he, who destroyed the first-born <transChange>of the Egyptians,</transChange> might not touch them.
Hebrews 11:29 By faith they passed through the Red-sea, as by dry <transChange>land,</transChange> which the Egyptians attempting <transChange>to do</transChange> were drowned.
Hebrews 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encompassed seven days.
Hebrews 11:31 By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, having received the spies with peace.
Hebrews 11:32 And what need I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and Barak, and Sampson, and Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and of the prophets:
Hebrews 11:33 who by faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
Hebrews 11:34 quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made powerful, became strong in battle, <transChange>and</transChange> turned to flight the armies of <transChange>their</transChange> enemies.
Hebrews 11:35 Women received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured <transChange>to death,</transChange> not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
Hebrews 11:36 And others had the trial of mockings and scourgings, and of bonds too and imprisonment.
Hebrews 11:37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the sword: they went about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted,
Hebrews 11:38 distressed, (of whom the world was not worthy) wandering in deserts, and mountains, and dens, and caves of the earth.
Hebrews 11:39 And these all, though they obtained an <transChange>honorable</transChange> testimony by faith, <transChange>yet</transChange> received not the promise;
Hebrews 11:40 God having provided something better concerning us, that without us they might not be made perfect. <chapter eID="gen7262" osisID="Heb.11"/>
Hebrews 12:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.12" sID="gen7303"/>
Hebrews 12:1 Having therefore so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every incumbrance, and the sin that easily besets <transChange>us,</transChange> and run with patience the race <transChange>that is</transChange> set before us,
Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the leader and finisher of <transChange>our</transChange> faith; who for the joy <transChange>that was</transChange> set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews 12:3 Wherefore consider Him who endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself, that ye may not give out, fainting in your minds:
Hebrews 12:4 <transChange>for</transChange> ye have not resisted unto blood <transChange>in</transChange> striving against sin.
Hebrews 12:5 Have ye forgotten the exhortation, which speaketh to you as to sons, <transChange>saying,</transChange> "My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor saint when rebuked by Him?
Hebrews 12:6 for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth."
Hebrews 12:7 If ye endure chastening, God treateth you as sons; for what son is there, whom the father doth not chastise?
Hebrews 12:8 But if ye be without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.
Hebrews 12:9 Now if we had fathers of our flesh, who corrected <transChange>us,</transChange> and we gave them reverence; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
Hebrews 12:10 For they indeed corrected <transChange>us</transChange> for a while, as seemed good to them; but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
Hebrews 12:11 Now no chastening seems for the present to be <transChange>matter</transChange> of joy but of grief: and yet afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those that are exercised thereby.
Hebrews 12:12 Lift up therefore the hands that hang down, and <transChange>strengthen</transChange> the feeble knees.
Hebrews 12:13 And make strait paths for your feet, that <transChange>what is</transChange> lame may not be turned out of the way, but rather be healed.
Hebrews 12:14 Follow peace with all <transChange>men;</transChange> and holiness, without which none shall see the Lord:
Hebrews 12:15 looking to it, least <transChange>there be</transChange> any one falling short of the grace of God, least any root of bitterness springing up should be troublesome, and by it many be defiled:
Hebrews 12:16 least <transChange>there be</transChange> any fornicator, or profane <transChange>person,</transChange> as Esau, who for one repast gave away his birthright.
Hebrews 12:17 For ye know that, when he would afterwards have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no room for repentance, though he sought it earnestly <transChange>even</transChange> with tears.
Hebrews 12:18 Ye are not come to a tangible mountain, and burning fire, and a thick cloud, and darkness, and tempest,
Hebrews 12:19 and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard, intreated that the word might not any more be <transChange>thus</transChange> delivered to them:
Hebrews 12:20 (for they could not bear the <transChange>strict</transChange> command, if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shot through with a dart;
Hebrews 12:21 and so terrible was the appearance <transChange>that</transChange> Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble:)
Hebrews 12:22 but ye are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
Hebrews 12:23 to the general assembly and church of the first-born who are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,
Hebrews 12:24 and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better <transChange>things</transChange> than Abel.
Hebrews 12:25 See that ye reject not Him that speaketh; for if they escaped not, who rejected him that gave forth divine oracles on earth, much less <transChange>shall</transChange> we, if we turn away from Him that <transChange>speaketh</transChange> from heaven:
Hebrews 12:26 whose voice then shook the earth; but now He hath promised, saying, "Yet once <transChange>more</transChange> I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven."
Hebrews 12:27 Now this <transChange>expression</transChange> "yet once more" signifieth the removing of the things that are shaken, as of things which had been appointed <transChange>only for a season,</transChange> that those <transChange>which cannot be</transChange> shaken may remain.
Hebrews 12:28 Wherefore since we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and holy fear:
Hebrews 12:29 for our God is a consuming fire. <chapter eID="gen7303" osisID="Heb.12"/>
Hebrews 13:0 <chapter osisID="Heb.13" sID="gen7333"/>
Hebrews 13:1 Let brotherly love continue.
Hebrews 13:2 Be not forgetful of hospitality; for thereby some have entertained angels, not knowing <transChange>it.</transChange>
Hebrews 13:3 Remember those that are in bonds, as <transChange>if</transChange> bound with them: <transChange>and</transChange> those that suffer evil as being yourselves also in the body.
Hebrews 13:4 Marriage <transChange>is</transChange> honorable in all, and the bed <transChange>is</transChange> not defiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
Hebrews 13:5 <transChange>Let your</transChange> conversation <transChange>be</transChange> free from covetousness, <transChange>and be</transChange> contented with what ye have: for He hath said, I will not leave thee; I will never, never forsake thee.
Hebrews 13:6 So that we may say with courage, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
Hebrews 13:7 Remember your guides, who spake the word of God to you; whose faith imitate, considering the <transChange>happy</transChange> end of <transChange>their</transChange> conversation.
Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ <transChange>is</transChange> the same yesterday, to day, and for ever:
Hebrews 13:9 be not <transChange>then</transChange> carried about by various and strange doctrines; for it is good that the heart be established by grace, <transChange>and</transChange> not in meats, in which those that have been <transChange>most</transChange> exact, have not profited <transChange>by them.</transChange>
Hebrews 13:10 We have an altar, of which those who perform service in the tabernacle have no right to eat.
Hebrews 13:11 As the bodies of those animals, whose blood <transChange>being offered</transChange> for sin is brought into the holy place by the high-priest, are <transChange>not eaten, but</transChange> are burnt without the camp.
Hebrews 13:12 Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.
Hebrews 13:13 Let us then go out unto Him without the camp, bearing his reproach: for we have here no continuing city,
Hebrews 13:14 but are seeking that which is to come.
Hebrews 13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of <transChange>our</transChange> lips giving thanks to his name.
Hebrews 13:16 But to do good and to communicate forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Hebrews 13:17 Be ruled by those that are your guides, and submit <transChange>to them:</transChange> for they watch for your souls; (as those that must give an account) that they may do it with joy and not with uneasiness: for this <transChange>were</transChange> unprofitable for you.
Hebrews 13:18 Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to behave well.
Hebrews 13:19 And I the more earnestly intreat <transChange>you</transChange> to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Hebrews 13:20 Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting covenant,
Hebrews 13:21 make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom <transChange>be</transChange> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Hebrews 13:22 I beseech you, brethren, bear with <transChange>this</transChange> word of exhortation: as I have written to you in brief.
Hebrews 13:23 Know that <transChange>our</transChange> brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom (if he come soon) I will see you.
Hebrews 13:24 Salute all that preside over you, <transChange>yea</transChange> and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.

James 1:1 <hi type="bold">James</hi> a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in dispersion <transChange>sendeth</transChange> greeting.
James 1:2 Account it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various trials:
James 1:3 knowing <transChange>this,</transChange> that the trial of your faith worketh patience;
James 1:4 but let patience have <transChange>it's</transChange> perfect work, that ye may be entirely perfect, failing in nothing.
James 1:5 And if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask <transChange>it</transChange> of God, who giveth to all <transChange>men</transChange> liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.
James 1:6 But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting; for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea blown about and tossed by the wind.
James 1:7 Let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.
James 1:8 A double-minded man <transChange>is</transChange> inconstant in all his ways.
James 1:9 Let the brother <transChange>that is</transChange> low rejoice in his exaltation: but the rich in his humiliation,
James 1:10 because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
James 1:11 For when the sun is risen with <transChange>it's</transChange> sultry heat, it drieth up the grass, and the flower of, it falleth, and the beauty of it's appearance is lost: so shall the rich man fade away in his projects.
James 1:12 Happy <transChange>is</transChange> the man who sustaineth temptation; for being approved he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.
James 1:13 Let no one that is tempted say, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted by evils, and He tempteth no one.
James 1:14 But every <transChange>man</transChange> is tempted, <transChange>when</transChange> drawn aside and insnared by his own <transChange>vehement</transChange> desire.
James 1:15 Then desire having conceived bringeth forth sin, and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death.
James 1:16 Be not <transChange>therefore</transChange> deceived, my beloved brethren: <transChange>for</transChange> every good gift,
James 1:17 and every perfect gift, <transChange>but no evil one,</transChange> is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation, nor shadow of turning:
James 1:18 who hath of his own will begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.
James 1:19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
James 1:20 for the wrath of man doth not practise the righteousness of God.
James 1:21 Laying aside therefore all filthiness, and excess of malice, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
James 1:22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
James 1:23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror,
James 1:24 who beheld himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.
James 1:25 But he that looketh well into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth <transChange>therein,</transChange> being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this <transChange>man</transChange> shall be blessed in his deed.
James 1:26 If any among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his heart, this man's devotion <transChange>is</transChange> vain.
James 1:27 Pure and uncorrupt religion before God and <transChange>our</transChange> Father is this, to take care of orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. <chapter eID="gen7360" osisID="Jas.1"/>
James 2:0 <chapter osisID="Jas.2" sID="gen7388"/>
James 2:1 My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <transChange>the Lord</transChange> of glory, in a <transChange>partial</transChange> respect of persons.
James 2:2 For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring in fine clothes, and there come in also a poor <transChange>man</transChange> in a mean habit;
James 2:3 and ye turn your eyes toward him that weareth the fine clothes, and say to him, Sit thou here in an honorable place; and say to the poor <transChange>man,</transChange> Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
James 2:4 do ye not make a <transChange>partial</transChange> difference within yourselves, and become judges that reason wickedly?
James 2:5 Hear, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen the poor of this world <transChange>who are</transChange> rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which He hath promised to them that love Him? but ye have slighted the poor.
James 2:6 Do not the rich tyrannize over you; and drag you to <transChange>their</transChange> tribunals?
James 2:7 Do they not blaspheme the glorious name by which ye are called?
James 2:8 If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, <transChange>which saith,</transChange> Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.
James 2:9 But if ye <transChange>partially</transChange> respect persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
James 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law <transChange>besides,</transChange> but offend in one <transChange>point,</transChange> he is under the penalty of all:
James 2:11 for He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but committest murder, thou art a transgressor of the law.
James 2:12 So speak, and so act, as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
James 2:13 For he shall have judgement without mercy, that hath not shewn mercy: but mercy triumpheth over judgement.
James 2:14 What <transChange>is</transChange> the advantage, my brethren, if any <transChange>one</transChange> say that he has faith, and he hath not works, can faith <transChange>alone</transChange> save him?
James 2:15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food;
James 2:16 and one of you say to them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and be ye filled: but ye give them not the necessaries of life, what profit <transChange>is it to them?</transChange>
James 2:17 so faith, if it have not works, being alone, is dead.
James 2:18 But one may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith by thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
James 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.
James 2:20 But desirest thou to know, O vain man, that faith without works, is dead?
James 2:21 <transChange>consider,</transChange> Was not our father Abraham justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?
James 2:22 Thou seest that faith co-operated with his works, and <transChange>that</transChange> by <transChange>his</transChange> works <transChange>his</transChange> faith was perfected.
James 2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.
James 2:24 Ye see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.
James 2:25 And in like manner also was not the harlot Rahab justified by works, when she entertained the spies, and let them out another way?
James 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. <chapter eID="gen7388" osisID="Jas.2"/>
James 3:0 <chapter osisID="Jas.3" sID="gen7415"/>
James 3:1 My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we <transChange>who are such</transChange> shall pass a stricter trial <transChange>than others:</transChange> for in many things we all offend;
James 3:2 <transChange>and</transChange> if any offend not in word, he is a compleat man, able to manage also the whole body.
James 3:3 Behold we put bridles into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body <transChange>as we please.</transChange>
James 3:4 Behold also the ships which are of so great bulk, <transChange>and</transChange> even when <transChange>they are</transChange> driven by hard winds, <transChange>yet</transChange> are turned about by a very small helm which way soever the pilot pleaseth.
James 3:5 So the tongue is a small part <transChange>of the body,</transChange> yet boasteth great things. Behold how much fuel a little fire kindleth!
James 3:6 And the tongue <transChange>is</transChange> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our <transChange>several</transChange> parts, defiling the whole body, inflaming the course of nature, and <transChange>is</transChange> set on fire by hell.
James 3:7 For every kind of wild beasts, and birds, and reptiles, and fishes, is tamed and hath been tamed by mankind:
James 3:8 but the tongue can no man tame; <transChange>it is</transChange> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
James 3:9 With it we bless God even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God:
James 3:10 out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not so to be.
James 3:11 Does a fountain from the same opening send forth sweet <transChange>water</transChange> and bitter?
James 3:12 Can a fig-tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine figs? so <transChange>can</transChange> no fountain produce salt water and sweet.
James 3:13 <transChange>Is there</transChange> any wise and understanding <transChange>man</transChange> among you? let him shew his works by a good conversation in the meekness of wisdom:
James 3:14 but if ye have bitter envy and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth;
James 3:15 this is not the wisdom, that cometh down from above, but <transChange>is</transChange> earthly, sensual, <transChange>and</transChange> diabolical:
James 3:16 for where envying and strife <transChange>is,</transChange> there is confusion and every evil work.
James 3:17 But the wisdom <transChange>that is</transChange> from above first is pure, then peaceable, mild, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
James 3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those that promote peace. <chapter eID="gen7415" osisID="Jas.3"/>

James 4:1 Whence <transChange>come</transChange> wars and fightings among you? <transChange>Come they</transChange> not hence? <transChange>even</transChange> of your <transChange>carnal</transChange> appetites making war in your bodies?
James 4:2 Ye desire, and ye have not: ye are envious, and jealous, and cannot obtain: ye fight and contend; but ye have not, because ye ask not.
James 4:3 Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask wickedly; that ye may spend <transChange>it</transChange> in your pleasures.
James 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world <transChange>is</transChange> enmity to God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
James 4:5 Do ye think the scripture speaks in vain? <transChange>or</transChange> does the Spirit that dwelleth in us, excite to envy?
James 4:6 No, He giveth more grace: wherefore it is said, God resisteth the proud, but sheweth favor to the humble.
James 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God: resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
James 4:8 Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you: cleanse your hands, O sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
James 4:9 Be grieved, and mourn, and weep: let your mirth be turned into mourning, and <transChange>your</transChange> joy to sadness.
James 4:10 Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.
James 4:11 Speak not against one another, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren; he that speaketh against <transChange>his</transChange> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
James 4:12 <transChange>Now</transChange> there is <transChange>but</transChange> one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou <transChange>then</transChange> that judgest another?
James 4:13 Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go to such a city, and spend a year there, and trade and get gain;
James 4:14 (though ye know not what <transChange>will be</transChange> on the morrow; for what is your life? a vapor, which appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away:) whereas ye <transChange>ought to</transChange> say,

James 5:1 Weep now, ye rich men, and howl for your miseries which are coming upon <transChange>you.</transChange>
James 5:2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten:
James 5:3 your gold and silver is cankered, and their rust shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh like fire: ye have been treasuring <transChange>them</transChange> up for the<transChange>se</transChange> last days.
James 5:4 Behold the hire of the laborers, that reaped your fields, of which they are defrauded by you, crieth out <transChange>against you:</transChange> and the complaints of the reapers are come into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
James 5:5 Ye have lived upon earth delicately and luxuriously; ye fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter.
James 5:6 Ye have condemned, ye have murdered the just <transChange>one, who</transChange> resisted you not.
James 5:7 Wait patiently therefore, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, till the coming of the Lord: behold the husbandman expecteth the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it, till he receive the former and the latter rain.
James 5:8 Be ye also patient, establish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord is near.
James 5:9 Repine not, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, against each other, that ye be not condemned: behold, the judge is at the door.
James 5:10 Take for an example of enduring evil and of long-suffering the prophets, who spake in the name of the Lord.
James 5:11 Behold, we account those happy, that are patient. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
James 5:12 But above all, my brethren, swear not; neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay; that ye may not fall under condemnation.
James 5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray: is any chearful? let him sing psalms.
James 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
James 5:15 and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
James 5:16 Confess <transChange>your</transChange> faults one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed: the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
James 5:17 Elias was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not upon the land for three years and six months:
James 5:18 and he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth put forth its fruit.
James 5:19 Brethren, if any among you be seduced from the truth, and one convert him;
James 5:20 let him know that he, who turneth back a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins. <chapter eID="gen7452" osisID="Jas.5"/> <div eID="gen7359" osisID="Jas" type="book"/>

I Peter 1:10 concerning which salvation the prophets, who prophesied of the grace <transChange>to be conferred</transChange> on you, enquired and diligently sought after <transChange>it:</transChange>
I Peter 1:11 searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did declare <transChange>in</transChange> testifying beforehand the sufferings <transChange>that were to come</transChange> upon Christ, and the glories following them:
I Peter 1:12 to whom it was revealed, that <transChange>it was</transChange> not to themselves, but to us they ministered these <transChange>things,</transChange> which are now declared unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you, through the holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
I Peter 1:13 Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober, and stedfastly hope for the grace to be conferred upon you at the appearing of Jesus Christ;
I Peter 1:14 as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance:
I Peter 1:15 but as He who hath called you is holy, be ye also holy in all <transChange>your</transChange> conversation: since it is written,
I Peter 1:16 Be ye holy, for I am holy.
I Peter 1:17 And if ye call upon the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:
I Peter 1:18 knowing that ye were redeemed from your vain conversation <transChange>learned</transChange> by tradition from your fathers, not with corruptible things, <transChange>as</transChange> silver and gold;

I Peter 2:3 for ye have tasted that the Lord <transChange>is</transChange> gracious;
I Peter 2:4 to whom coming <transChange>as to</transChange> a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen of God,
I Peter 2:5 <transChange>and</transChange> precious, ye also are built up as living stones, a spiritual house, an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
I Peter 2:6 Whence also it is said in scripture, Behold I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone, choice <transChange>and</transChange> precious: and he that confideth on it shall not be ashamed.
I Peter 2:7 To you therefore who believe <transChange>it is</transChange> precious: but to them that are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner,

I Peter 2:9 But ye <transChange>are</transChange> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should declare the glories of Him, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
I Peter 2:10 who heretofore <transChange>were</transChange> not a people, but <transChange>are</transChange> now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
I Peter 2:11 <transChange>Dearly</transChange> beloved, I exhort you as strangers and sojourners <transChange>here,</transChange> to abstain from carnal lusts, which war against the soul:
I Peter 2:12 having a good conversation among the Gentiles; that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may glorify God in the day of <transChange>their</transChange> visitation, on account of the good works which they behold <transChange>in you.</transChange>
I Peter 2:13 Be subject therefore to every human form of government, for the Lord's sake: whether <transChange>it</transChange> be to a king as supreme;
I Peter 2:14 or to governors as <transChange>persons</transChange> sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and <transChange>the</transChange> praise of them that do well.
I Peter 2:15 For so is the will of God, that by <transChange>your</transChange> good behaviour ye may silence the ignorance of foolish <transChange>men:</transChange>
I Peter 2:16 as free, and <transChange>yet</transChange> not using <transChange>your</transChange> liberty as a cloke for wickedness, but as <transChange>the</transChange> servants of God.
I Peter 2:17 Give <transChange>due</transChange> honor to all <transChange>men.</transChange> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
I Peter 2:18 Ye <transChange>who are</transChange> servants, <transChange>be</transChange> subject to <transChange>your</transChange> masters with all fear, not only to the good and mild, but also to the morose:
I Peter 2:19 for this is <transChange>an evidence of</transChange> grace, if any one for conscience towards God endure griefs, suffering unjustly.
I Peter 2:20 For what glory <transChange>is it,</transChange> if when ye sin and are punished <transChange>for it,</transChange> ye bear it patiently? but if when ye do well and suffer <transChange>for it,</transChange> ye bear it patiently, this <transChange>will gain</transChange> favor with God.
I Peter 2:21 For unto this are ye called; because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye might follow his steps.
I Peter 2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
I Peter 2:23 who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed <transChange>Himself</transChange> to Him that judgeth righteously.
I Peter 2:24 Who Himself bare our sins in his own body on the cross, that we being dead to sins, might live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye are healed.

I Peter 3:1 Ye women likewise, be subject to your own husbands, that if any believe not the word, they may yet without the word be gained over by the deportment of the wives,
I Peter 3:2 beholding your chaste conversation in <transChange>the</transChange> fear <transChange>of God.</transChange>
I Peter 3:3 Whose adorning, let it not be that without, of plaiting the hair, and putting on of gold, or wearing <transChange>fine</transChange> clothes;
I Peter 3:4 but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible <transChange>ornament</transChange> of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

I Peter 3:6 whose daughters ye are, if ye do well, and are not terrified with any <transChange>sinful</transChange> fear.
I Peter 3:7 Ye husbands likewise, dwell with <transChange>them</transChange> according to knowledge, yielding due respect to the wife as the weaker vessel, and as joint-heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
I Peter 3:8 Finally, <transChange>my beloved, be</transChange> unanimous, <transChange>be</transChange> sympathizing, love as brethren, <transChange>be</transChange> compassionate, <transChange>be</transChange> courteous:
I Peter 3:9 not returning evil for evil, or reproach for reproach: but on the contrary blessing <transChange>even those that curse you:</transChange> knowing ye are called unto this, that ye may obtain a blessing.
I Peter 3:10 "For he that would desire life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile;
I Peter 3:11 let him turn away from evil, and do good:
I Peter 3:12 let him seek peace, and pursue it: for the eyes of the Lord <transChange>are</transChange> upon the righteous, and his ears <transChange>are open</transChange> to their prayer: but the face of the Lord <transChange>is</transChange> against them that do evil."
I Peter 3:13 And who will hurt you, if ye be imitators of Him that is good?
I Peter 3:14 But if ye should even suffer for righteousness sake, happy <transChange>are ye:</transChange> and <transChange>therefore</transChange> be not afraid of their menaces, neither be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts:
I Peter 3:15 and be always ready to answer every one that asketh you a reason of the hope <transChange>that is</transChange> in you, with meekness and reverence:
I Peter 3:16 having a good conscience, that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ.
I Peter 3:17 For <transChange>it is</transChange> better (if it be the will of God) to suffer <transChange>for</transChange> doing good than <transChange>for</transChange> doing evil.
I Peter 3:18 As Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust (that He might introduce us to God) being indeed put to death in the flesh, but raised to life by the Spirit:
I Peter 3:19 by which also He went and preached to the spirits <transChange>now</transChange> in prison;
I Peter 3:20 who of old were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing; wherein <transChange>a</transChange> few, that is eight souls, were saved by water.
I Peter 3:21 The resemblance of which, <transChange>even</transChange> baptism, doth also now save us, (not the <transChange>outward</transChange> cleansing of filth from the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
I Peter 3:22 who is gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him. <chapter eID="gen7526" osisID="1Pet.3"/>

I Peter 4:2 that he should no longer live the rest of <transChange>his</transChange> time in the flesh according to the lusts of men, but after the will of God.
I Peter 4:3 For the time past of <transChange>our</transChange> life <transChange>is</transChange> sufficient for us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, walking in lasciviousness, <transChange>inordinate</transChange> desires, excess of wine, revellings, drunkenness, and abominable idolatries:
I Peter 4:4 in which they think it strange that ye run not with <transChange>them</transChange> into the same excess of riot, and <transChange>therefore</transChange> speak evil <transChange>of you:</transChange>
I Peter 4:5 who shall give an account to Him, who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
I Peter 4:6 For to this <transChange>end</transChange> was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but might live according to God in the spirit.
I Peter 4:7 But the end of all <transChange>things</transChange> draws nigh: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer:
I Peter 4:8 having above all things fervent love to each other; for love will cover a multitude of sins.
I Peter 4:9 <transChange>Be</transChange> hospitable one to another, without grudging;
I Peter 4:10 as every one hath received a gift, imparting it to each other, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
I Peter 4:11 If any one speak, <transChange>let it be</transChange> as <transChange>declaring</transChange> the oracles of God: if any one minister, <transChange>let it be</transChange> as from the power which God affordeth <transChange>him:</transChange> that in all <transChange>things</transChange> God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
I Peter 4:12 Beloved, be not surprised at the fiery trial <transChange>coming</transChange> upon you, which is to try you, as if some strange <transChange>thing</transChange> befel you:
I Peter 4:13 but rejoice in that ye are partakers in the sufferings of Christ; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may also rejoice with exceeding joy.
I Peter 4:14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy <transChange>are ye;</transChange> for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: <transChange>and</transChange> though as to them He is blasphemed, yet as to you He is glorified.
I Peter 4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or <transChange>as</transChange> a thief, or <transChange>as</transChange> a malefactor, or as an intermeddler with other people's affairs.
I Peter 4:16 But if <transChange>any suffer</transChange> as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God herein.
I Peter 4:17 For the time <transChange>is coming</transChange> when judgement is to begin at the house of God: and if at us first, what <transChange>will be</transChange> the end of those that obey not the gospel of God?
I Peter 4:18 And if the righteous be saved with difficulty, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

II Peter 1:4 by which are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped the corruption <transChange>that is</transChange> in the world through lust.

II Peter 1:8 For if these be in you and abound, they will not suffer <transChange>you</transChange> to be idle, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
II Peter 1:9 But he, that hath not these, is blind, <transChange>or</transChange> short-sighted, having forgot his <transChange>baptismal</transChange> purification from his former sins.
II Peter 1:10 Wherefore, <transChange>my</transChange> brethren, be the more diligent <transChange>thus</transChange> to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these <transChange>things</transChange> ye shall never fall.

II Peter 1:16 For we did not follow artfully devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
II Peter 1:17 For He received from God the Father honor and glory when a voice came to Him from the magnificent glory, <transChange>saying</transChange>, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
II Peter 1:18 And this voice, from heaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount.
II Peter 1:19 We have also the more sure word of the prophets, to which ye do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till the day dawn, and the morning-star rise in your hearts:
II Peter 1:20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation;

II Peter 2:8 (for that good <transChange>man</transChange> by seeing and hearing <transChange>their crimes,</transChange> when he dwelt among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day with <transChange>their</transChange>
II Peter 2:9 iniquitous deeds) <transChange>then</transChange> the Lord knoweth how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to reserve the wicked to the day of judgement <transChange>to be</transChange> punished:
II Peter 2:10 especially those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise authority; <transChange>who, being</transChange> audacious <transChange>and</transChange> self-willed, are not afraid to speak evil of dignities:
II Peter 2:11 whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.
II Peter 2:12 But these <transChange>men,</transChange> like brute beasts naturally produced to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil of things which they do not understand, shall perish by their own corruption; receiving the reward of <transChange>their</transChange> unrighteousness:
II Peter 2:13 who account it a pleasure to riot <transChange>even</transChange> in the day; spots and disgraces; revelling in their frauds, while they partake of your feasts:
II Peter 2:14 having eyes full of adultery, and which cannot be restrained from sin: ensnaring unstable souls, <transChange>and</transChange> having a heart practised in rapine; cursed people:
II Peter 2:15 who have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam <transChange>the son</transChange> of Bosor, who loved the wages of iniquity;
II Peter 2:16 but was reproved for his transgression: <transChange>for</transChange> a dumb beast speaking with the voice of a man checked the madness of the prophet.
II Peter 2:17 These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm, for whom thick darkness is reserved for ever.
II Peter 2:18 For when they speak swelling words of vanity, they ensnare in the lusts of the flesh, through <transChange>their</transChange> lasciviousness, those who had indeed withdrawn from such as deal in error;
II Peter 2:19 promising them liberty, while they themselves are the slaves of corruption: for by whom any one is vanquished, by him he is also enslaved.
II Peter 2:20 For if, after they had escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled and vanquished by them, their last state is worse than the first;
II Peter 2:21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than when they knew <transChange>it,</transChange> to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
II Peter 2:22 But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog <transChange>is</transChange> returned to his own vomit, and, The swine that was washed to <transChange>her</transChange> wallowing in the mire. <chapter eID="gen7607" osisID="2Pet.2"/>

II Peter 3:1 This second epistle, <transChange>my</transChange> beloved, I now write unto you; in <transChange>both</transChange> which I stir up your sincere mind in remembrance,
II Peter 3:2 that ye may be mindful of the words formerly spoken by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: knowing this first,
II Peter 3:3 that there will come in the last days scoffers,
II Peter 3:4 walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the declaration of his coming? for except that the fathers are fallen asleep, all things remain as <transChange>they were</transChange> from the beginning of the creation.
II Peter 3:5 For they are willingly ignorant of this, that by the Word of God the heavens were <transChange>made</transChange> of old, and the earth <transChange>too</transChange> from the water, and subsisting on the water.
II Peter 3:6 Whence the old world being drowned in water perished.
II Peter 3:7 But the heavens and the earth, <transChange>that</transChange> now <transChange>are,</transChange> by the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto fire on the day of judgement and destruction of ungodly men.
II Peter 3:8 But, beloved; be not ignorant of this one <transChange>thing,</transChange> that one day <transChange>is</transChange> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
II Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slow as to his promise (as some count <transChange>it</transChange> slowness) but is long-suffering towards us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
II Peter 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements being set on fire shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works therein shall be burnt up.
II Peter 3:11 Seeing then that all these <transChange>things</transChange> shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness,
II Peter 3:12 expecting and hastening on the coming of the day of God, whereby the heavens being set on fire shall be dissolved, and the burning elements shall be melted.
II Peter 3:13 But we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwelleth.
II Peter 3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing ye expect these <transChange>things,</transChange> give diligence to be found of Him in peace, spotless and blameless;
II Peter 3:15 and account the long-suffering of our Lord salvation, as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, hath written unto you;
II Peter 3:16 as also in all <transChange>his</transChange> epistles, speaking in them of these <transChange>things:</transChange> in which are some <transChange>things</transChange> hard to be understood, which the illiterate and unstable wrest, as <transChange>they do</transChange> also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
II Peter 3:17 Do ye therefore, beloved, as ye know <transChange>these things</transChange> before, take heed least being seduced together <transChange>with them</transChange> by the error of the wicked, ye should fall from your own stedfastness.
II Peter 3:18 But grow in grace, and in <transChange>the</transChange> knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: to Him <transChange>be</transChange> glory both now and for ever. Amen. <chapter eID="gen7630" osisID="2Pet.3"/> <div eID="gen7584" osisID="2Pet" type="book"/>

I John 1:1 <hi type="bold">That</hi> which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have contemplated, and our <transChange>very</transChange> hands have felt concerning the Word of life,
I John 1:2 (for <transChange>this</transChange> Life was manifested, and we saw <transChange>it;</transChange> and we testify and declare unto you <transChange>that</transChange> eternal Life, which was with the Father,
I John 1:3 and was manifested unto us) what we have seen and heard we declare unto you, that ye also may have communion with us: and our communion is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
I John 1:4 And these <transChange>things</transChange> we write unto you, that your joy may be complete.
I John 1:5 Now this we have heard from Him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
I John 1:6 If we say that we have communion with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practise the truth:
I John 1:7 but if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have communion with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
I John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
I John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness:

I John 2:1 My little children, I write these <transChange>things</transChange> unto you, that ye may not sin. And if any <transChange>man</transChange> sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
I John 2:2 And He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for <transChange>the sins of</transChange> the whole world.
I John 2:3 And by this we know that we have known Him, if we keep his commandments.
I John 2:4 He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
I John 2:5 But whosoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: <transChange>and</transChange> by this we know that we are in Him.
I John 2:6 He that saith, he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.
I John 2:7 Brethren, I write not a new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning:
I John 2:8 <transChange>though</transChange> I write <transChange>it</transChange> again <transChange>as</transChange> a new commandment, which is truth in Him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
I John 2:9 <transChange>Now</transChange> he that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is still in darkness:
I John 2:10 <transChange>whereas,</transChange> he that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and is in no danger of stumbling.
I John 2:11 But he, that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not where he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
I John 2:12 I write unto you, little children, because for his sake your sins are forgiven you:
I John 2:13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him <transChange>that is</transChange> from the beginning: <transChange>and</transChange> I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked <transChange>one</transChange>. <transChange>Yea</transChange> I have written to you, little children, because ye have known the Father:
I John 2:14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him <transChange>that is</transChange> from the beginning: <transChange>and</transChange> I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked <transChange>one</transChange>---
I John 2:15 Love not the world, nor the things <transChange>that are</transChange> in the world; <transChange>for</transChange> if any <transChange>one</transChange> love the world <transChange>to excess,</transChange> the love of the Father is not in him.
I John 2:16 For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.
I John 2:17 And the world passeth away, and the desire of it: but he, that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.
I John 2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that an antichrist will come, there are even now many antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.
I John 2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been <transChange>indeed</transChange> of us, they would have continued with us; but <transChange>this was done</transChange> that they might be made manifest, because all, <transChange>that are with us,</transChange> are not <transChange>indeed</transChange> of us.
I John 2:20 And ye have an unction from the holy <transChange>One,</transChange> and know all.
I John 2:21 I have not <transChange>therefore</transChange> written to you, because ye know not the truth; but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
I John 2:22 Who is a liar, if not he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, that denieth the Father as well as the Son;
I John 2:23 <transChange>for</transChange> whosoever denieth the Son, hath not the Father: <transChange>but he that confesseth the Son acknowledgeth the Father also.</transChange>
I John 2:24 Let that therefore, which ye have heard from the beginning, abide in you: <transChange>for</transChange> if that, which ye heard from the beginning, remain in you, ye also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
I John 2:25 And this is the promise which He hath promised us, <transChange>even</transChange> eternal life.
I John 2:26 These <transChange>things</transChange> have I written unto you concerning those who <transChange>would</transChange> seduce you.
I John 2:27 But the unction, which ye have received from Him, abideth in you; and <transChange>therefore</transChange> ye have no need that any should teach you: since this <transChange>very</transChange> unction teacheth you concerning all things, and is truth and not falshood; even as that hath taught you, abide in Him.
I John 2:28 And now, little children, abide, <transChange>I say,</transChange> in Him; that, when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and may not be ashamed before Him at his coming.

I John 3:2 Beloved, we are now the children of God, but it doth not yet appear what we shall be: we know however, that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.
I John 3:3 And every <transChange>one,</transChange> that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself, even as He is pure.
I John 3:4 Every <transChange>one</transChange> that committeth sin, transgresseth the law; for sin is the violation of the law.
I John 3:5 And ye know that He was manifested, to take away our sins: and in Him there is no sin.
I John 3:6 Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, nor known Him.
I John 3:7 Little children, let no one deceive you: he that practiseth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous:
I John 3:8 he, that makes a practise of sin, is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. <transChange>And</transChange> for this the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.
I John 3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not practise sin, because his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
I John 3:10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doth not practise righteousness, and he who loveth not his brother, is not of God:
I John 3:11 for this is the injunction which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: not as Cain <transChange>who</transChange> was of the evil <transChange>one,</transChange> and slew his brother;
I John 3:12 and why did he slay him? because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
I John 3:13 Wonder not <transChange>then,</transChange> my brethren, if the world hate you:
I John 3:14 <transChange>since</transChange> we know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: he, that loveth not his brother, remaineth in death.
I John 3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
I John 3:16 In this we know his love, that He laid down his life for us: and we should <transChange>be ready to</transChange> lay down our lives for the brethren.
I John 3:17 But if any one, who hath the good things of the world, seeth his brother in want, and shutteth up his bowels from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
I John 3:18 My little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue <transChange>only,</transChange> but in deed and in truth.
I John 3:19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.
I John 3:20 For, if our heart condemn us, God is <transChange>still</transChange> greater than our heart, and knoweth all <transChange>things.</transChange>
I John 3:21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <transChange>then</transChange> have we confidence towards God:
I John 3:22 and whatsoever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
I John 3:23 And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as He hath given us a charge <transChange>to do.</transChange>
I John 3:24 And he, that keepeth his commandments, abideth in Him, and He in him: and hereby we know that He abideth in us, <transChange>even</transChange> by the Spirit which He hath given us. <chapter eID="gen7691" osisID="1John.3"/>

I John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the spirits, whether they be of God: for many false prophets are gone out into the world.
I John 4:2 By this ye <transChange>may</transChange> know the Spirit of God: every Spirit that confesseth Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is of God:
I John 4:3 and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that <transChange>spirit</transChange> of antichrist, which ye have heard was coming, and is already in the world.
I John 4:4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He, that is in you, than he that is in the world.
I John 4:5 They are of the world; therefore they speak <transChange>as men</transChange> of the world, and the world heareth them.
I John 4:6 We are of God: he, that knoweth God, heareth us; <transChange>but</transChange> he, who is not of God, heareth not us. By this we know the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
I John 4:7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is from God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
I John 4:8 He, that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is love.
I John 4:9 In this was the love of God manifested towards us, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.
I John 4:10 Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent his Son <transChange>to be</transChange> a propitiation for our sins.
I John 4:11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
I John 4:12 No one hath ever seen God: <transChange>but</transChange> if we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us.
I John 4:13 By this we know that we are in Him, and He in us; because He hath given us of his Spirit.
I John 4:14 And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent the Son <transChange>to be</transChange> the Saviour of the world.
I John 4:15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
I John 4:16 And we have known and believed the love which God hath towards us: <transChange>for</transChange> God is love; and he, that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.
I John 4:17 Herein is love perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgement; for as He is, we also are in this world.
I John 4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment; but he that feareth is not perfected in love.
I John 4:19 We love Him, because He first loved us. If any <transChange>one</transChange> say,
I John 4:20 I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for how can he, that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, love God whom he hath not seen?
I John 4:21 And we have this commandment from Him, that he, who loveth God, should love his brother also. <chapter eID="gen7716" osisID="1John.4"/>

I John 5:1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one, that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of Him:
I John 5:2 <transChange>and</transChange> in this we know that we love the children of God, since we love God and keep his commandments.
I John 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
I John 5:4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that vanquisheth the world, <transChange>even</transChange> our faith.
I John 5:5 Who <transChange>then</transChange> is he that overcometh the world, but he who believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
I John 5:6 This is He that came by water and <transChange>by</transChange> blood, <transChange>even</transChange> Jesus the Messiah; not with water only, but with water and blood: and <transChange>of this</transChange> the Spirit beareth witness, for the Spirit is truth.
I John 5:7 Yea there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood:
I John 5:8 and these three agree in one.
I John 5:9 <transChange>Now</transChange> if we admit the testimony of men, <transChange>sure</transChange> the testimony of God is greater: and this is the testimony of God, which He hath testified concerning his Son.
I John 5:10 He, that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witness in himself: he, that believeth not God, hath <transChange>in effect</transChange> made Him a liar, because he believed not the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.
I John 5:11 And the testimony is this, that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.
I John 5:12 He that hath the Son hath life: he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
I John 5:13 These <transChange>things</transChange> have I written to you, who believe on the name of the son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may <transChange>the more firmly</transChange> believe on the name of the Son of God.
I John 5:14 And this is the confidence, which we have towards Him, that if we ask any <transChange>thing</transChange> according to his will, He heareth us:
I John 5:15 and if we know that He heareth us <transChange>in</transChange> whatsoever we ask; we know that we <transChange>shall</transChange> have the petitions, which we have requested of Him.
I John 5:16 If any <transChange>one</transChange> see his brother commit a sin <transChange>which is</transChange> not unto death, let him pray <transChange>for him,</transChange> and <transChange>God</transChange> will give him life, <transChange>that is</transChange> for them that do not sin unto death. There is a sin unto death: <transChange>and</transChange> for that I do not say that he should pray.
I John 5:17 All unrighteousness <transChange>indeed</transChange> is sin, and <transChange>yet</transChange> there is a sin not unto death.
I John 5:18 We know that whosoever is born of God, doth not <transChange>practise</transChange> sin: but keepeth himself <transChange>from it,</transChange> and the wicked one doth not touch him.
I John 5:19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth under the wicked one.
I John 5:20 But we know that the son of God is come, and hath given us understanding, that we may know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is true, <transChange>and</transChange> in his son Jesus Christ: He is the true God, and eternal life.

Jude 1:1 <hi type="bold">Jude</hi> a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified in God the Father, and <transChange>who are</transChange> preserved and called in Jesus Christ;
Jude 1:2 mercy, and peace, and love be multiplied unto you.
Jude 1:3 Beloved, having an earnest desire to write to you concerning the common salvation, I was under a necessity of writing to exhort <transChange>you</transChange> that ye would strive earnestly for the faith <transChange>which was</transChange> once delivered to the saints.
Jude 1:4 For there have crept in some men, <transChange>who have been</transChange> of old described <transChange>as</transChange> under this condemnation, impious <transChange>people,</transChange> that turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and deny God the only Lord, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
Jude 1:5 But I would remind you of this, which ye know already, that though the Lord saved the people out of the land of Egypt, <transChange>yet</transChange> He afterwards destroyed those that believed not:
Jude 1:6 and the angels that kept not their primitive state, but left their proper abode, hath He reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, to the judgement of the great day:
Jude 1:7 as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them, in like manner with them committing lewdness, and going after strange flesh, are set forth <transChange>as</transChange> an example, suffering the vengeance of perpetual fire.
Jude 1:8 So these <transChange>vile</transChange> dreamers also defile the flesh, despise authority, and speak evil of dignities.
Jude 1:9 Whereas Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, did not presume to bring against him a railing accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke thee."
Jude 1:10 But these <transChange>men</transChange> speak evil of what they know not: and what they know naturally, as brute animals, in these <transChange>things</transChange> they are corrupt.
Jude 1:11 Wo unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and been carried away by Balaam's error, <transChange>the love</transChange> of lucre, and perished <transChange>as</transChange> in the contradiction of Korah.
Jude 1:12 These are spots in your love-feasts, feeding themselves without fear, when they are feasting with you: clouds without water, carried about by the winds; trees withered <transChange>and</transChange> without fruit, twice dead <transChange>and</transChange> rooted up; raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
Jude 1:13 wandering stars, for whom blackness of darkness is reserved for ever.
Jude 1:14 And Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied against these, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with his holy myriads,
Jude 1:15 to pass judgement upon all, and to convict all the ungodly among them of all their wicked works, which they have impiously committed, and of all the hard <transChange>things</transChange> which impious sinners have spoken against Him.
Jude 1:16 These are murmurers, complainers, who walk according to their own <transChange>irregular</transChange> desires; and their mouth speaketh great swelling <transChange>words,</transChange> with admiration of <transChange>certain</transChange> persons for <transChange>some</transChange> advantage <transChange>of their own.</transChange>
Jude 1:17 But, beloved, remember the words which were formerly spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; for they told you,
Jude 1:18 that in the latter days there will be scoffers, walking according to their own impious lusts.
Jude 1:19 These are they who separate themselves, sensualists, not having the Spirit.
Jude 1:20 But ye, beloved, edifying yourselves in your most holy faith, <transChange>and</transChange> praying in the holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God,
Jude 1:21 looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude 1:22 And on some have compassion, making a difference; others save with fear,
Jude 1:23 <transChange>as</transChange> snatching <transChange>them</transChange> out of the fire: hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
Jude 1:24 Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you blameless before <transChange>the presence of</transChange> his glory with exceeding joy:
Jude 1:25 to the only wise God our Saviour <transChange>be</transChange> glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and for ever. Amen. <chapter eID="gen7793" osisID="Jude.1"/> <div eID="gen7792" osisID="Jude" type="book"/>

Revelation of John 1:2 who bare witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, and <transChange>to</transChange> whatever He saw.
Revelation of John 1:3 Happy <transChange>is</transChange> he that readeth, and those that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things <transChange>that are</transChange> written therein: for the time <transChange>is</transChange> near.

Revelation of John 1:12 And I turned to see the voice that spake to me: and when I turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
Revelation of John 1:13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks <transChange>one</transChange> like the Son of man, clothed with a long robe, and girded about the breasts with a golden girdle.
Revelation of John 1:14 His head and <transChange>his</transChange> hairs <transChange>were</transChange> white like white wool, <transChange>as white</transChange> as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire;
Revelation of John 1:15 and his feet like fine brass, as <transChange>if they were</transChange> glowing in a furnace: and his voice as the sound of many waters:
Revelation of John 1:16 and He had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance <transChange>was</transChange> as the sun <transChange>when he</transChange> shineth in his strength.
