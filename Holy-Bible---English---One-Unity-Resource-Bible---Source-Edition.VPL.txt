GEN 1:1 B'resheet Elohim bara' ·In the beginning of the beginning, God created from nothingness· את the heavens את and the earth.
GEN 1:2 Earth was tohu v'bohu ·void and chaos·. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and Ruach Elohim ·Spirit, Breath of God· was hovering over the surface of the waters.
GEN 1:3 God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
GEN 1:4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.
GEN 1:5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first yom ·period of time, day·.
GEN 1:6 God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”
GEN 1:7 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so·.
GEN 1:8 God called the expanse “shamayim ·sky, heavens·”. There was evening and there was morning, a second yom ·period of time, day·.
GEN 1:9 God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so.
GEN 1:10 God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering together of the waters he called “sea”. God saw that it was good.
GEN 1:11 God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so.
GEN 1:12 The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
GEN 1:13 There was evening and there was morning, a third yom ·period of time, day·. (A:2)
GEN 1:14 God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons and appointed times, days, and years;
GEN 1:15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so.
GEN 1:16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.
GEN 1:17 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,
GEN 1:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.
GEN 1:19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth 'yom ·period of time, day·.
GEN 1:20 God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky.”
GEN 1:21 God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.
GEN 1:22 God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
GEN 1:23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth 'yom ·period of time, day·. (A:3)
GEN 1:24 God said, “Let the earth produce nefesh chai ·soul living· creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so.
GEN 1:25 God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
GEN 1:26 God said, “Let us make a 'adam ·human· in our image, after our likeness: and let them have authority over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
GEN 1:27 God created man in his own likeness. In God’s image he created him; zachar ·male· and n'keivah ·female· he created them.
GEN 1:28 God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and bring it into subjection, subdue it. Have authority over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
GEN 1:29 God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.
GEN 1:30 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.
GEN 1:31 God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was m'ohd tov ·exceedingly good·. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth 'yom ·period of time, day·.
GEN 2:1 The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished.
GEN 2:2 On the seventh 'yom ·period of time, day· God finished his work which he had done; and he shavat ·rested· on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
GEN 2:3 God blessed the seventh day, and made it set apart holy, because he rested in it from all his work of barah' ·creation from nothingness· which he had done. (A:4, S:2)
GEN 2:4 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. On the day that Adonai God made earth and heaven,
GEN 2:5 no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Adonai God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was no human to till the ground,
GEN 2:6 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.
GEN 2:7 Adonai God formed and framed a human from the dust of ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breaths of lives; and man became a living soul.
GEN 2:8 Adonai God planted a garden eastward, in Eden [Delight], and there he put the man whom he had formed.
GEN 2:9 Out of the ground Adonai God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the 'etz chai ·tree of life· in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
GEN 2:10 A river went out of Eden [Delight] to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.
GEN 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
GEN 2:12 and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there.
GEN 2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.
GEN 2:14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria [Level plain]. The fourth river is the Euphrates [Fruitful].
GEN 2:15 Adonai God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden [Delight] to cultivate and keep it.
GEN 2:16 Adonai God enjoined the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
GEN 2:17 but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely have death.”
GEN 2:18 Adonai God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a help-mate suitable for him.”
GEN 2:19 Out of the ground Adonai God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name. (S:3)
GEN 2:20 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.
GEN 2:21 Adonai God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
GEN 2:22 Adonai God refined and fashioned an 'ishah ·wife woman· from the rib which had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.
GEN 2:23 The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘'ishah ·wife woman·,’ because she was taken out of 'ish ·husband man·.”
GEN 2:24 Therefore a husband man will leave his father and his mother, and will dabak ·cling to, worship· with his wife woman, and they will be echad ·one· flesh.
GEN 2:25 The husband man and his wife woman were both naked, and they were not ashamed.
GEN 3:1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Adonai God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?’”
GEN 3:2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,
GEN 3:3 but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”
GEN 3:4 The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t surely die,
GEN 3:5 for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
GEN 3:6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.
GEN 3:7 Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.
GEN 3:8 They sh'ma ·heard obeyed· Adonai God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Adonai God among the trees of the garden.
GEN 3:9 Adonai God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”
GEN 3:10 The man said, “I sh'ma ·heard obeyed· your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.”
GEN 3:11 God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I enjoined you not to eat from?”
GEN 3:12 The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
GEN 3:13 Adonai God said to the woman, “What have you done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
GEN 3:14 Adonai God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. You shall go on your belly and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
GEN 3:15 I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.”
GEN 3:16 To the woman he said, “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bear children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will have authority over you.”
GEN 3:17 To Adam [Human, Red earth] he said, “Because you have sh'ma ·hear obey· your wife’s voice, and ate from the tree, about which I enjoined you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ the ground is cursed for your sake. You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.
GEN 3:18 It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.
GEN 3:19 By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you teshuvah ·complete return· to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall made teshuvah ·complete return·.”
GEN 3:20 The man called his wife Eve [Life] because she would be the mother of all the living.
GEN 3:21 Adonai God made coats of animal skins for Adam [Human, Red earth] and for his wife, and clothed them. (A:5, S:4)
GEN 3:22 Adonai God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...”
GEN 3:23 Therefore Adonai God physically sent him out from the garden of Eden [Delight], to till the ground from which he was taken.
GEN 3:24 So he gahrash ·relationally divorced· the man; and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
GEN 4:1 The man knew Eve [Life] his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain [Acquisition], and said, “I have gotten a man with Adonai’s help.”
GEN 4:2 Again she gave birth, to Cain [Acquisition]’s brother Abel [Vanity, Mourning]. Abel [Vanity, Mourning] was a keeper of sheep, but Cain [Acquisition] was a tiller of the ground.
GEN 4:3 As time passed, Cain [Acquisition] brought an offering to Adonai from the fruit of the ground.
GEN 4:4 Abel [Vanity, Mourning] also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Adonai respected Abel [Vanity, Mourning] and his offering,
GEN 4:5 but he didn’t respect Cain [Acquisition] and his offering. Cain [Acquisition] was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.
GEN 4:6 Adonai said to Cain [Acquisition], “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?
GEN 4:7 If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, habitual sin ·missing the mark· crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”
GEN 4:8 Cain [Acquisition] said to Abel [Vanity, Mourning], his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain [Acquisition] rose up against Abel [Vanity, Mourning], his brother, and murdered him.
GEN 4:9 Adonai said to Cain [Acquisition], “Where is Abel [Vanity, Mourning], your brother?” He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”
GEN 4:10 Adonai said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.
GEN 4:11 Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
GEN 4:12 From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”
GEN 4:13 Cain [Acquisition] said to Adonai, “My depravity (moral evil) is greater than I can bear.
GEN 4:14 Behold, you have divorced and driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”
GEN 4:15 Adonai said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain [Acquisition], vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Adonai appointed a sign for Cain [Acquisition], so that anyone finding him would not strike him.
GEN 4:16 Cain [Acquisition] left Adonai’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden [Delight].
GEN 4:17 Cain [Acquisition] knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
GEN 4:18 To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. (S:5)
GEN 4:19 Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.
GEN 4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
GEN 4:21 His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.
GEN 4:22 Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain [Acquisition], the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain [Acquisition]’s sister was Naamah.
GEN 4:23 Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.
GEN 4:24 If Cain [Acquisition] will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”
GEN 4:25 Adam [Human, Red earth] knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth [Appointed], saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel [Vanity, Mourning], for Cain [Acquisition] killed him.”
GEN 4:26 A son was also born to Seth [Appointed], and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Adonai’s name.
GEN 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam [Human, Red earth]. In the day that God created man, he made him in God’s likeness.
GEN 5:2 He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were created, he named them “Adam [Human, Red earth]”.
GEN 5:3 Adam [Human, Red earth] lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth [Appointed].
GEN 5:4 The days of Adam [Human, Red earth] after he became the father of Seth [Appointed] were eight hundred years, and he became the father of other sons and daughters.
GEN 5:5 All the days that Adam [Human, Red earth] lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.
GEN 5:6 Seth [Appointed] lived one hundred five years, then became the father of Enosh.
GEN 5:7 Seth [Appointed] lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
GEN 5:8 All of the days of Seth [Appointed] were nine hundred twelve years, then he died.
GEN 5:9 Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan.
GEN 5:10 Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan, eight hundred fifteen years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
GEN 5:11 All of the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.
GEN 5:12 Kenan lived seventy years, then became the father of Mahalalel.
GEN 5:13 Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters
GEN 5:14 and all of the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.
GEN 5:15 Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Jared.
GEN 5:16 Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
GEN 5:17 All of the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.
GEN 5:18 Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, then became the father of Enoch.
GEN 5:19 Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
GEN 5:20 All of the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.
GEN 5:21 Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the father of Methuselah.
GEN 5:22 After Methuselah’s birth, Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 5:23 All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
GEN 5:24 Enoch walked with God, and he was not found, for God took him. (7)
GEN 5:25 Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, then became the father of Lamech.
GEN 5:26 Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
GEN 5:27 All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.
GEN 5:28 Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, then became the father of a son.
GEN 5:29 He named him Noah [Rest], saying, “This one will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, caused by the ground which Adonai has cursed.”
GEN 5:30 Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah [Rest] five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of other sons and daughters.
GEN 5:31 All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.
GEN 5:32 Noah [Rest] was five hundred years old, then Noah [Rest] became the father of Shem [Name], Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], and Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide].
GEN 6:1 When men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
GEN 6:2 Beni-Elohim ·Sons of Elohim God· saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives.
GEN 6:3 Adonai said, “My Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.”
GEN 6:4 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the Beni-Elohim ·Sons of Elohim God· came in to men’s daughters and had children with them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 6:5 Adonai saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of man’s heart was continually only evil.
GEN 6:6 Adonai was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.
GEN 6:7 Adonai said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground— man, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky— for I am sorry that I have made them.”
GEN 6:8 But Noah [Rest] found chen ·grace· in Adonai’s eyes.
GEN 6:9 This is the history of the generations of Noah [Rest]: Noah [Rest] was a upright man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah [Rest] walked with God.
GEN 6:10 Noah [Rest] became the father of three sons: Shem [Name], Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], and Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide].
GEN 6:11 The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
GEN 6:12 God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
GEN 6:13 God said to Noah [Rest], “I will bring an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth.
GEN 6:14 Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.
GEN 6:15 This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship shall be three hundred cubits [450 ft; 1,372 m], its width fifty cubits [75 ft; 228.6 m], and its height thirty cubits [45 ft; 137.16 m].
GEN 6:16 You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit [18 in; 45.72 cm] upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
GEN 6:17 I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die.
GEN 6:18 But I will establish my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.
GEN 6:19 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.
GEN 6:20 Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them alive.
GEN 6:21 Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them.”
GEN 6:22 Thus Noah [Rest] did. He did all that God enjoined him.
GEN 7:1 Adonai said to Noah [Rest], “Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.
GEN 7:2 You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female.
GEN 7:3 Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.
GEN 7:4 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of the ground.”
GEN 7:5 Noah [Rest] did everything that Adonai enjoined him.
GEN 7:6 Noah [Rest] was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
GEN 7:7 Noah [Rest] went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because of the flood waters.
GEN 7:8 Clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground
GEN 7:9 went by pairs to Noah [Rest] into the ship, male and female, as God enjoined Noah [Rest].
GEN 7:10 After the seven days, the flood waters came on the earth.
GEN 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah [Rest]’s life, in the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·), on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky’s windows were opened.
GEN 7:12 It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.
GEN 7:13 In the same day Noah [Rest], and Shem [Name], Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], and Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide]— the sons of Noah— and Noah [Rest]’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship—
GEN 7:14 they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
GEN 7:15 Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went to Noah [Rest] into the ship.
GEN 7:16 Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God enjoined him; then Adonai shut him in. (3)
GEN 7:17 The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.
GEN 7:18 The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
GEN 7:19 The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
GEN 7:20 The waters rose fifteen cubits [22.5 ft; 68.58 m] higher, and the mountains were covered.
GEN 7:21 All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.
GEN 7:22 All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died.
GEN 7:23 Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah [Rest] was left, and those who were with him in the ship.
GEN 7:24 The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.
GEN 8:1 God remembered Noah [Rest], all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.
GEN 8:2 The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
GEN 8:3 The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.
GEN 8:4 The ship rested in the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]·, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains.
GEN 8:5 The waters receded continually until the tenth month Tevet ·Ten (in Hebrew) / Good (In Aramaic), 10·. In the tenth month Tevet ·Ten (in Hebrew) / Good (In Aramaic), 10·, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible.
GEN 8:6 At the end of forty days, Noah [Rest] opened the window of the ship which he had made,
GEN 8:7 and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.
GEN 8:8 He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,
GEN 8:9 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him into the ship, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship.
GEN 8:10 He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship.
GEN 8:11 The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah [Rest] knew that the waters were abated from the earth.
GEN 8:12 He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him any more.
GEN 8:13 In the six hundred first year, in the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah [Rest] removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.
GEN 8:14 In the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·), on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. (4)
GEN 8:15 God spoke to Noah [Rest], saying,
GEN 8:16 “Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.
GEN 8:17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.”
GEN 8:18 Noah [Rest] went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him.
GEN 8:19 Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
GEN 8:20 Noah [Rest] built an altar to Adonai, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
GEN 8:21 Adonai smelled the pleasant aroma. Adonai said in his heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike every living thing, as I have done.
GEN 8:22 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.”
GEN 9:1 God blessed Noah [Rest] and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
GEN 9:2 The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand.
GEN 9:3 Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you.
GEN 9:4 But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.
GEN 9:5 I will surely require your blood of your lives; at the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.
GEN 9:6 Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image.
GEN 9:7 Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.” (5)
GEN 9:8 God spoke to Noah [Rest] and to his sons with him, saying,
GEN 9:9 “As for me, behold, I establish my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with you, and with your offspring after you,
GEN 9:10 and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.
GEN 9:11 I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”
GEN 9:12 God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
GEN 9:13 I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.
GEN 9:14 When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,
GEN 9:15 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
GEN 9:16 The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”
GEN 9:17 God said to Noah [Rest], “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.” (6)
GEN 9:18 The sons of Noah [Rest] who went out from the ship were Shem [Name], Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], and Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide]. Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion] is the father of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 9:19 These three were the sons of Noah [Rest], and from these, the whole earth was populated.
GEN 9:20 Noah [Rest] began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.
GEN 9:21 He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.
GEN 9:22 Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], the father of Canaan [Humbled], saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
GEN 9:23 Shem [Name] and Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide] took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness.
GEN 9:24 Noah [Rest] awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.
GEN 9:25 He said, “Canaan [Humbled] is cursed. He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.”
GEN 9:26 He said, “Blessed be Adonai , the God of Shem [Name]. Let Canaan [Humbled] be his servant.
GEN 9:27 May God enlarge Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide]. Let him dwell in the tents of Shem [Name]. Let Canaan [Humbled] be his servant.”
GEN 9:28 Noah [Rest] lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.
GEN 9:29 All the days of Noah [Rest] were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died.
GEN 10:1 Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah [Rest] and of Shem [Name], Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], and Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide]. Sons were born to them after the flood.
GEN 10:2 The sons of Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide] were: Gomer, Magog [From roof-top], Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
GEN 10:3 The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
GEN 10:4 The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
GEN 10:5 Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.
GEN 10:6 The sons of Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion] were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 10:7 The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.
GEN 10:8 Cush became the father of Nimrod [Let us rebel]. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.
GEN 10:9 He was a mighty hunter before Adonai. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod [Let us rebel], a mighty hunter before Adonai”.
GEN 10:10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel [Confusion], Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
GEN 10:11 Out of that land he went into Assyria [Level plain], and built Nineveh [Offspring’s Habitation], Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
GEN 10:12 and Resen between Nineveh [Offspring’s Habitation] and the great city Calah.
GEN 10:13 Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
GEN 10:14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] descended from), and Caphtorim.
GEN 10:15 Canaan [Humbled] became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth [Trembling fear],
GEN 10:16 the Jebusites [Descendants of Thresher], the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], the Girgashites [Descendants of Who arrives from pilgrimage],
GEN 10:17 the Hivites [Wicked], the Arkites, the Sinites,
GEN 10:18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled] were spread abroad.
GEN 10:19 The border of the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled] was from Sidon— as you go toward Gerar— to Gaza— as you go toward Sodom [Burning], Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants], Admah, and Zeboiim— to Lasha.
GEN 10:20 These are the sons of Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.
GEN 10:21 Children were also born to Shem [Name], the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth [Enlargement, Spreading wide].
GEN 10:22 The sons of Shem [Name] were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram [Elevated].
GEN 10:23 The sons of Aram [Elevated] were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
GEN 10:24 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.
GEN 10:25 To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan.
GEN 10:26 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
GEN 10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
GEN 10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
GEN 10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.
GEN 10:30 Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
GEN 10:31 These are the sons of Shem [Name], by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.
GEN 10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah [Rest], by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.
GEN 11:1 The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
GEN 11:2 As they traveled east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
GEN 11:3 They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
GEN 11:4 They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”
GEN 11:5 Adonai came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.
GEN 11:6 Adonai said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
GEN 11:7 Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not sh'ma ·hear understand obey· one another’s speech.”
GEN 11:8 So Adonai scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.
GEN 11:9 Therefore its name was called Babel [Confusion], because there Adonai confused the language of all the earth. From there, Adonai scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
GEN 11:10 This is the history of the generations of Shem [Name]: Shem [Name] was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
GEN 11:11 Shem [Name] lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:12 Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.
GEN 11:13 Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:14 Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber.
GEN 11:15 Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:16 Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.
GEN 11:17 Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:18 Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.
GEN 11:19 Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:20 Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.
GEN 11:21 Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:22 Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.
GEN 11:23 Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:24 Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.
GEN 11:25 Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
GEN 11:26 Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Avram [Exalted father], Nahor, and Haran [Mountaineer].
GEN 11:27 Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Avram [Exalted father], Nahor, and Haran [Mountaineer]. Haran [Mountaineer] became the father of Lot [Veil, Covering].
GEN 11:28 Haran [Mountaineer] died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 11:29 Avram [Exalted father] and Nahor married wives. The name of Avram [Exalted father]’s wife was Sarai [Mockery], and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran [Mountaineer] who was also the father of Iscah.
GEN 11:30 Sarai [Mockery] was barren. She had no child.
GEN 11:31 Terah took Avram [Exalted father] his son, Lot [Veil, Covering] the son of Haran [Mountaineer], his son’s son, and Sarai [Mockery] his daughter-in-law, his son Avram [Exalted father]’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan [Humbled]. They came to Haran [Mountaineer] and lived there.
GEN 11:32 The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran [Mountaineer].
GEN 12:1 Now Adonai said to Avram [Exalted father], “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you.
GEN 12:2 I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.
GEN 12:3 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”
GEN 12:4 So Avram [Exalted father] went out, as Adonai had told him. Lot [Veil, Covering] went with him. Avram [Exalted father] was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran [Mountaineer].
GEN 12:5 Avram [Exalted father] took Sarai [Mockery] his wife, Lot [Veil, Covering] his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran [Mountaineer], and they went to go into the land of Canaan [Humbled]. They entered into the land of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 12:6 Avram [Exalted father] passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled] were in the land, then.
GEN 12:7 Adonai appeared to Avram [Exalted father] and said, “I will give this land to your seed.” He built an altar there to Adonai, who had appeared to him.
GEN 12:8 He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Beth-el [House of God] and pitched his tent, having Beth-el [House of God] on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Adonai and called on Adonai’s name.
GEN 12:9 Avram [Exalted father] traveled, still going on toward the South.
GEN 12:10 There was a famine in the land. Avram [Exalted father] went down into Egypt [Abode of slavery] to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.
GEN 12:11 When he had come near to enter Egypt [Abode of slavery], he said to Sarai [Mockery] his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.
GEN 12:12 It will happen, when the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive.
GEN 12:13 Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.” (2)
GEN 12:14 When Avram [Exalted father] had come into Egypt [Abode of slavery], Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] saw that the woman was very beautiful.
GEN 12:15 The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
GEN 12:16 He dealt well with Avram [Exalted father] for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
GEN 12:17 Adonai afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai [Mockery], Avram [Exalted father]’s wife.
GEN 12:18 Pharaoh called Avram [Exalted father] and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?
GEN 12:19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”
GEN 12:20 Pharaoh enjoined men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had.
GEN 13:1 Avram [Exalted father] went up out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]— he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot [Veil, Covering] with him— into the South.
GEN 13:2 Avram [Exalted father] was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
GEN 13:3 He went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el [House of God], to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el [House of God] and Ai,
GEN 13:4 to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Avram [Exalted father] called on Adonai’s name. (3)
GEN 13:5 Lot [Veil, Covering] also, who went with Avram [Exalted father], had flocks, herds, and tents.
GEN 13:6 The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.
GEN 13:7 There was strife between the herdsmen of Avram [Exalted father]’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot [Veil, Covering]’s livestock. The Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled] and the Perizzites [Descendants of Belonging to village] lived in the land at that time.
GEN 13:8 Avram [Exalted father] said to Lot [Veil, Covering], “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.
GEN 13:9 Is not the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
GEN 13:10 Lot [Veil, Covering] lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan [Descender], that it was well-watered everywhere, before Adonai destroyed Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants], like the garden of Adonai, like the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], as you go to Zoar [Small].
GEN 13:11 So Lot [Veil, Covering] chose the Plain of the Jordan [Descender] for himself. Lot [Veil, Covering] traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.
GEN 13:12 Avram [Exalted father] lived in the land of Canaan [Humbled], and Lot [Veil, Covering] lived in the 'Ieyr HaKikar [Cities of the Round], and moved his tent as far as Sodom [Burning].
GEN 13:13 Now the men of Sodom [Burning] were exceedingly wicked and people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· against Adonai.
GEN 13:14 Adonai said to Avram [Exalted father], after Lot [Veil, Covering] was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
GEN 13:15 for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.
GEN 13:16 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted.
GEN 13:17 Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”
GEN 13:18 Avram [Exalted father] moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre [Bitter, Fatness], which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Adonai.
GEN 14:1 In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,
GEN 14:2 they made war with Bera, king of Sodom [Burning], and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants], Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar [Small]).
GEN 14:3 All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).
GEN 14:4 They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.
GEN 14:5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one] in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
GEN 14:6 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to El Paran, which is by the wilderness.
GEN 14:7 They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites [Descendants of Man who licks up], and also the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], that lived in Hazazon Tamar [Palm tree].
GEN 14:8 The king of Sodom [Burning], and the king of Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants], and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar [Small]) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;
GEN 14:9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
GEN 14:10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants] fled, and some fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills.
GEN 14:11 They took all the goods of Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants], and all their food, and went their way.
GEN 14:12 They took Lot [Veil, Covering], Avram [Exalted father]’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom [Burning], and his goods, and departed.
GEN 14:13 One who had escaped came and told Avram [Exalted father], the Hebrew [Immigrant]. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre [Bitter, Fatness], the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and they were allies of Avram [Exalted father].
GEN 14:14 When Avram [Exalted father] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that his relative was taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan [He judged].
GEN 14:15 He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus [Bucket of blood].
GEN 14:16 He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot [Veil, Covering], and his goods, and the women also, and the other people.
GEN 14:17 The king of Sodom [Burning] went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
GEN 14:18 Malki-Tzedek king of Shalem [My king Righteousness king of City peace] brought out bread and wine. He was a priest of El 'Elyon [God Most High],
GEN 14:19 so he blessed him saying, “Blessed be Avram [Exalted father] of El 'Elyon [God Most High], possessor of heaven and earth:
GEN 14:20 and blessed be El 'Elyon [God Most High], who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” Avram [Exalted father] gave him a tenth of all. (5)
GEN 14:21 The king of Sodom [Burning] said to Avram [Exalted father], “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”
GEN 14:22 Avram [Exalted father] said to the king of Sodom [Burning], “I have lifted up my hand to Adonai, El 'Elyon [Yahweh, God Most High], possessor of heaven and earth,
GEN 14:23 that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Avram [Exalted father] rich.’
GEN 14:24 I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre [Bitter, Fatness]. Let them take their portion.”
GEN 15:1 After these things Davar Yahweh [Word of He sustains breathing] came to Avram [Exalted father] in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Avram [Exalted father]. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”
GEN 15:2 Avram [Exalted father] said, “'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus [Bucket of blood]?”
GEN 15:3 Avram [Exalted father] said, “Behold, to me you have given no children: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”
GEN 15:4 Behold, Adonai’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.”
GEN 15:5 Adonai brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Avram [Exalted father], “So will your offspring be.”
GEN 15:6 He trusted in Adonai , who credited it to him for righteousness. (6)
GEN 15:7 He said to Avram [Exalted father], “I am Adonai who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.”
GEN 15:8 He said, “'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], how will I know that I will inherit it?”
GEN 15:9 He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”
GEN 15:10 He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds.
GEN 15:11 The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Avram [Exalted father] drove them away.
GEN 15:12 When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Avram [Exalted father]. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.
GEN 15:13 He said to Avram [Exalted father], “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.
GEN 15:14 I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,
GEN 15:15 but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.
GEN 15:16 In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the depravity (moral evil) of the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers] is not yet full.”
GEN 15:17 It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
GEN 15:18 In that day Adonai made a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with Avram [Exalted father], saying, “I have given this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to the great river, the river Euphrates [Fruitful]:
GEN 15:19 the Kenites [Descendants of Acquisition], the Kenezites [Descendants of Purchase], the Kadmonites [Descendants of Ancients, Chiefs],
GEN 15:20 the Hittites [Descendants of Trembling fear], the Perizzites [Descendants of Belonging to village], the Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one],
GEN 15:21 the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled], the Girgashites [Descendants of Who arrives from pilgrimage], and the Jebusites [Descendants of Thresher].”
GEN 16:1 Now Sarai [Mockery], Avram [Exalted father]’s wife, bore him no children. She had a servant, an Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], whose name was Hagar [Flight].
GEN 16:2 Sarai [Mockery] said to Avram [Exalted father], “See now, Adonai has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my servant. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Avram [Exalted father] sh'ma ·hear obey· the voice of Sarai [Mockery].
GEN 16:3 Sarai [Mockery], Avram [Exalted father]’s wife, took Hagar [Flight] the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], her servant, after Avram [Exalted father] had lived ten years in the land of Canaan [Humbled], and gave her to Avram [Exalted father] her husband to be his wife.
GEN 16:4 He went in to Hagar [Flight], and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
GEN 16:5 Sarai [Mockery] said to Avram [Exalted father], “You have brought this wrong on me! I gave my servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Adonai judge between me and you.”
GEN 16:6 But Avram [Exalted father] said to Sarai [Mockery], “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.” Sarai [Mockery] dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.
GEN 16:7 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.
GEN 16:8 He said, “Hagar [Flight], Sarai [Mockery]’s servant, where did you come from? Where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai [Mockery].”
GEN 16:9 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] said to her, “Teshuvah ·Completely return· to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.”
GEN 16:10 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring, that they will not be counted for multitude.”
GEN 16:11 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] said to her, “Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael [Pays attention God], because Adonai has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· your affliction.
GEN 16:12 He will be like a wild donkey among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. He will live opposite all of his brothers.”
GEN 16:13 She called the name of Adonai who spoke to her, “You are El Ro'i Ra'ah [God who sees me / God who provides],” for she said, “Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?”
GEN 16:14 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi [Well of the one who lives and sees]. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
GEN 16:15 Hagar [Flight] bore a son for Avram [Exalted father]. Avram [Exalted father] called the name of his son, whom Hagar [Flight] bore, Ishmael [Pays attention God].
GEN 16:16 Avram [Exalted father] was eighty-six years old when Hagar [Flight] bore Ishmael [Pays attention God] to Avram [Exalted father].
GEN 17:1 When Avram [Exalted father] was ninety-nine years old, Adonai appeared to Avram [Exalted father], and said to him, “I am El Shaddai [God Almighty]. Walk before me, and be blameless.
GEN 17:2 I will make my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”
GEN 17:3 Avram [Exalted father] fell on his face. God talked with him, saying,
GEN 17:4 “As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations.
GEN 17:5 Your name will no more be called Avram [Exalted father], but your name will be Abraham [Father of a multitude]; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
GEN 17:6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you. (7)
GEN 17:7 I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your offspring after you.
GEN 17:8 I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan [Humbled], for an everlasting possession. I will be their God.”
GEN 17:9 God said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], “As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
GEN 17:10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised.
GEN 17:11 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.
GEN 17:12 He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout all your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.
GEN 17:13 He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
GEN 17:14 The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·.”
GEN 17:15 God said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], “As for Sarai [Mockery] your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai [Mockery], but her name will be Sarah [Princess].
GEN 17:16 I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her.”
GEN 17:17 Then Abraham [Father of a multitude] fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah [Princess], who is ninety years old, give birth?”
GEN 17:18 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said to God, “Oh that Ishmael [Pays attention God] might live before you!”
GEN 17:19 God said, “No, but Sarah [Princess], your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac [Laughter]. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· for his offspring after him.
GEN 17:20 As for Ishmael [Pays attention God], I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
GEN 17:21 But my covenant I establish with Isaac [Laughter], whom Sarah [Princess] will bear to you at this set time next year.”
GEN 17:22 When he finished talking with him, the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· went up from Abraham [Father of a multitude].
GEN 17:23 Abraham [Father of a multitude] took Ishmael [Pays attention God] his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money; every male among the men of Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 17:24 Abraham [Father of a multitude] was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
GEN 17:25 Ishmael [Pays attention God], his son, was thirteen years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.
GEN 17:26 In the same day both Abraham [Father of a multitude] and Ishmael [Pays attention God], his son, were circumcised.
GEN 17:27 All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
GEN 18:1 Adonai appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre [Bitter, Fatness], as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
GEN 18:2 He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
GEN 18:3 and said, “My lord, if now I have found chen ·grace· in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant.
GEN 18:4 Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
GEN 18:5 I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.” They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”
GEN 18:6 Abraham [Father of a multitude] hurried into the tent to Sarah [Princess], and said, “Quickly prepare three seahs [23.1 qt; 21.9 L] of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”
GEN 18:7 Abraham [Father of a multitude] ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.
GEN 18:8 He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
GEN 18:9 They asked him, “Where is Sarah [Princess], your wife?” He said, “See, in the tent.”
GEN 18:10 He said, “I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah [Princess] your wife will have a son.” Sarah [Princess] sh'ma ·hear obey· in the tent door, which was behind him.
GEN 18:11 Now Abraham [Father of a multitude] and Sarah [Princess] were old, well advanced in age. Sarah [Princess] had passed the age of childbearing.
GEN 18:12 Sarah [Princess] laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”
GEN 18:13 Adonai said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], “Why did Sarah [Princess] laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?’
GEN 18:14 Is anything too hard for Adonai? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah [Princess] will have a son.” (2)
GEN 18:15 Then Sarah [Princess] denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.”
GEN 18:16 The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom [Burning]. Abraham [Father of a multitude] went with them to see them on their way.
GEN 18:17 Adonai said, “Will I hide from Abraham [Father of a multitude] what I do,
GEN 18:18 since Abraham [Father of a multitude] will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?
GEN 18:19 For I have known him, to the end that he may enjoin his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Adonai, to do righteousness and right judgement; to the end that Adonai may bring on Abraham [Father of a multitude] that which he has spoken of him.”
GEN 18:20 Adonai said, “Because the cry of Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants] is great, and because their habitual sin ·missing the mark· is very grievous,
GEN 18:21 I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.”
GEN 18:22 The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom [Burning], but Abraham [Father of a multitude] stood yet before Adonai.
GEN 18:23 Abraham [Father of a multitude] came near, and said, “Will you consume the upright with the wicked?
GEN 18:24 What if there are fifty upright within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty upright who are in it?
GEN 18:25 Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the upright with the wicked, so that the upright should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Should not the Judge of all the earth do right judgement?”
GEN 18:26 Adonai said, “If I find in Sodom [Burning] fifty upright within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”
GEN 18:27 Abraham [Father of a multitude] answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to 'Adonay [Lord], although I am dust and ashes.
GEN 18:28 What if there will lack five of the fifty upright? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?” He said, “I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.”
GEN 18:29 He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?” He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”
GEN 18:30 He said, “Oh don’t let 'Adonay [Lord] be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?” He said, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”
GEN 18:31 He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to 'Adonay [Lord]. What if there are twenty found there?” He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”
GEN 18:32 He said, “Oh don’t let 'Adonay [Lord] be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?” He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”
GEN 18:33 Adonai went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham [Father of a multitude], and Abraham [Father of a multitude] returned to his place.
GEN 19:1 The two angels came to Sodom [Burning] at evening. Lot [Veil, Covering] sat in the gate of Sodom [Burning]. Lot [Veil, Covering] saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,
GEN 19:2 and he said, “See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.” They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”
GEN 19:3 He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked matzah ·unleavened bread·, and they ate.
GEN 19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom [Burning], surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.
GEN 19:5 They called to Lot [Veil, Covering], and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”
GEN 19:6 Lot [Veil, Covering] went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
GEN 19:7 He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.
GEN 19:8 See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”
GEN 19:9 They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot [Veil, Covering], and came near to break the door.
GEN 19:10 But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot [Veil, Covering] into the house to them, and shut the door.
GEN 19:11 They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
GEN 19:12 The men said to Lot [Veil, Covering], “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:
GEN 19:13 for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Adonai that Adonai has sent us to destroy it.”
GEN 19:14 Lot [Veil, Covering] went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Adonai will destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
GEN 19:15 When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot [Veil, Covering], saying, “Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the depravity (moral evil) of the city.”
GEN 19:16 But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Adonai being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.
GEN 19:17 It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”
GEN 19:18 Lot [Veil, Covering] said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.
GEN 19:19 See now, your servant has found chen ·grace· in your sight, and you have magnified your chesed ·loving-kindness·, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.
GEN 19:20 See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little town. Oh let me escape there, is not it a little one?, and there I will be safe.” (4)
GEN 19:21 He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
GEN 19:22 Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar [Small].
GEN 19:23 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot [Veil, Covering] came to Zoar [Small].
GEN 19:24 Then Adonai caused sulfur and fire to rain down upon Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants] from Adonai out of the sky.
GEN 19:25 He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
GEN 19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
GEN 19:27 Abraham [Father of a multitude] got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Adonai.
GEN 19:28 He looked toward Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants], and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
GEN 19:29 When God destroyed the 'Ieyr HaKikar [Cities of the Round], God remembered Abraham [Father of a multitude], and sent Lot [Veil, Covering] out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot [Veil, Covering] lived.
GEN 19:30 Lot [Veil, Covering] went up out of Zoar [Small], and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar [Small]. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
GEN 19:31 The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.
GEN 19:32 Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”
GEN 19:33 They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
GEN 19:34 It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”
GEN 19:35 They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.
GEN 19:36 Thus both of Lot [Veil, Covering]’s daughters were with child by their father.
GEN 19:37 The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab [From father]. He is the father of the Moabites [Descendants of From father] to this day.
GEN 19:38 The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi [Son of my people]. He is the father of the children of Ammon [Tribal people] to this day.
GEN 20:1 Abraham [Father of a multitude] traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.
GEN 20:2 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said about Sarah [Princess] his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech [My father king] king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah [Princess].
GEN 20:3 But God came to Abimelech [My father king] in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man’s wife.”
GEN 20:4 Now Abimelech [My father king] had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a upright nation?
GEN 20:5 Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister?’ She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this.”
GEN 20:6 God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning ·deviating (from the standard goal)· against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.
GEN 20:7 Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”
GEN 20:8 Abimelech [My father king] rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.
GEN 20:9 Then Abimelech [My father king] called Abraham [Father of a multitude], and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I committed crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great cause for sacrifice for sin ·missing the goal·? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”
GEN 20:10 Abimelech [My father king] said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”
GEN 20:11 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’
GEN 20:12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
GEN 20:13 When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your chesed ·loving-kindness· which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
GEN 20:14 Abimelech [My father king] took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham [Father of a multitude], and restored Sarah [Princess], his wife, to him.
GEN 20:15 Abimelech [My father king] said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”
GEN 20:16 To Sarah [Princess] he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”
GEN 20:17 Abraham [Father of a multitude] prayed to God. God healed Abimelech [My father king], and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.
GEN 20:18 For Adonai had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech [My father king], because of Sarah [Princess], Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s wife.
GEN 21:1 Adonai visited Sarah [Princess] as he had said, and Adonai did to Sarah [Princess] as he had spoken.
GEN 21:2 Sarah [Princess] conceived, and bore Abraham [Father of a multitude] a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
GEN 21:3 Abraham [Father of a multitude] called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah [Princess] bore to him, Isaac [Laughter].
GEN 21:4 Abraham [Father of a multitude] circumcised his son, Isaac [Laughter], when he was eight days old, as God had enjoined him. (5)
GEN 21:5 Abraham [Father of a multitude] was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac [Laughter], was born to him.
GEN 21:6 Sarah [Princess] said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who sh'ma ·hears obeys· will laugh with me.”
GEN 21:7 She said, “Who would have said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], that Sarah [Princess] would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”
GEN 21:8 The child grew, and was cameled. Abraham [Father of a multitude] made a great feast on the day that Isaac [Laughter] was cameled.
GEN 21:9 Sarah [Princess] saw the son of Hagar [Flight] the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], whom she had borne to Abraham [Father of a multitude], metzahek ·lewd and irreverent jokes·.
GEN 21:10 Therefore she said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], “Divorce and cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac [Laughter].”
GEN 21:11 The thing was very grievous in Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s sight on account of his son.
GEN 21:12 God said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah [Princess] says to you, sh'ma ·hear obey· her voice. For your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac [Laughter].
GEN 21:13 I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.”
GEN 21:14 Abraham [Father of a multitude] rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar [Flight], putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath].
GEN 21:15 The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
GEN 21:16 She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
GEN 21:17 God sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of the boy. Ha mal'ak Elohim [The Angel of God] called to Hagar [Flight] out of the sky, and said to her, “What ails you, Hagar [Flight]? Don’t be afraid. For God has sh'ma ·hear obey· the voice of the boy where he is.
GEN 21:18 Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”
GEN 21:19 God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.
GEN 21:20 God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
GEN 21:21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. (6)
GEN 21:22 At that time, Abimelech [My father king] and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham [Father of a multitude], saying, “God is with you in all that you do.
GEN 21:23 Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the chesed ·loving-kindness· that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”
GEN 21:24 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said, “I will swear.”
GEN 21:25 Abraham [Father of a multitude] complained to Abimelech [My father king] because of a water well, which Abimelech [My father king]’s servants had violently taken away.
GEN 21:26 Abimelech [My father king] said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of it until today.”
GEN 21:27 Abraham [Father of a multitude] took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech [My father king]. Those two made a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·.
GEN 21:28 Abraham [Father of a multitude] set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
GEN 21:29 Abimelech [My father king] said to Abraham [Father of a multitude], “What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?”
GEN 21:30 He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.”
GEN 21:31 Therefore he called that place Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath], because they both swore there.
GEN 21:32 So they made a covenant at Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath]. Abimelech [My father king] rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)].
GEN 21:33 Abraham [Father of a multitude] planted a tamarisk tree in Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath], and called there on the name of Adonai, the El 'Olam [God Everlasting].
GEN 21:34 Abraham [Father of a multitude] lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] many days.
GEN 22:1 After these things, God tested Abraham [Father of a multitude], and said to him, “Abraham [Father of a multitude]!” He said, “Here I am.”
GEN 22:2 He said, “Now take your son, your only son, whom you 'ahavta ·affectionately love·, even Isaac [Laughter], and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”
GEN 22:3 Abraham [Father of a multitude] rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac [Laughter] his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.
GEN 22:4 On the third day Abraham [Father of a multitude] lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.
GEN 22:5 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will hawa ·bow low, prostrate· in worship, and come back to you.”
GEN 22:6 Abraham [Father of a multitude] took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac [Laughter] his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.
GEN 22:7 Isaac [Laughter] spoke to Abraham [Father of a multitude] his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
GEN 22:8 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together.
GEN 22:9 They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham [Father of a multitude] built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac [Laughter] his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.
GEN 22:10 Abraham [Father of a multitude] stretched out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.
GEN 22:11 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham! [Father of a multitude, Father of a multitude]!” He said, “Here I am.”
GEN 22:12 He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
GEN 22:13 Abraham [Father of a multitude] lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham [Father of a multitude] went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
GEN 22:14 Abraham [Father of a multitude] called the name of that place Yahweh Yeer'eh [Yahweh will be seen / He sustains breathing will provide]. As it is said to this day, “On Adonai ’s mountain, it will be provided.”
GEN 22:15 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] called to Abraham [Father of a multitude] a second time out of the sky,
GEN 22:16 and said, “I have sworn by myself, says Adonai, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
GEN 22:17 I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies.
GEN 22:18 By your offspring, all the nations of the earth will be blessed because you have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my voice.”
GEN 22:19 So Abraham [Father of a multitude] returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath]. Abraham [Father of a multitude] lived at Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath]. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 22:20 After these things, Abraham [Father of a multitude] was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
GEN 22:21 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram [Elevated],
GEN 22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
GEN 22:23 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah [Securely bound]. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s brother.
GEN 22:24 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN 23:1 Sarah [Princess] lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah [Princess]’s life.
GEN 23:2 Sarah [Princess] died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan [Humbled]. Abraham [Father of a multitude] came to mourn for Sarah [Princess], and to weep for her.
GEN 23:3 Abraham [Father of a multitude] rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth [Trembling fear], saying,
GEN 23:4 “I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
GEN 23:5 The children of Heth [Trembling fear] answered Abraham [Father of a multitude], saying to him,
GEN 23:6 “Sh'ma ·hear obey· us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”
GEN 23:7 Abraham [Father of a multitude] rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth [Trembling fear].
GEN 23:8 He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, sh'ma ·hear obey· me, and entreat for me to Ephron [Fawn-like] the son of Zohar,
GEN 23:9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah [Double], which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place.”
GEN 23:10 Now Ephron [Fawn-like] was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth [Trembling fear]. Ephron [Fawn-like] the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear] answered Abraham [Father of a multitude] in the hearing of the children of Heth [Trembling fear], even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
GEN 23:11 “No, my lord, sh'ma ·hear obey· me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”
GEN 23:12 Abraham [Father of a multitude] bowed himself down before the people of the land.
GEN 23:13 He spoke to Ephron [Fawn-like] in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please sh'ma ·hear obey· me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there.”
GEN 23:14 Ephron [Fawn-like] answered Abraham [Father of a multitude], saying to him,
GEN 23:15 “My lord, sh'ma ·hear obey· unto me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels [10 lb; 4.54 kg] of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.”
GEN 23:16 Abraham [Father of a multitude] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· to Ephron [Fawn-like]. Abraham [Father of a multitude] weighed to Ephron [Fawn-like] the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth [Trembling fear], four hundred shekels [10 lb; 4.54 kg] of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard [where one shekel is 0.4 oz; 11.34 g]. (2)
GEN 23:17 So the field of Ephron [Fawn-like], which was in Machpelah [Double], which was before Mamre [Bitter, Fatness], the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded
GEN 23:18 to Abraham [Father of a multitude] for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth [Trembling fear], before all who went in at the gate of his city.
GEN 23:19 After this, Abraham [Father of a multitude] buried Sarah [Princess] his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah [Double] before Mamre [Bitter, Fatness] (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 23:20 The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham [Father of a multitude] for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth [Trembling fear].
GEN 24:1 Abraham [Father of a multitude] was old, and well stricken in age. Adonai had blessed Abraham [Father of a multitude] in all things.
GEN 24:2 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh.
GEN 24:3 I will make you swear by Adonai, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled], among whom I live.
GEN 24:4 But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac [Laughter].”
GEN 24:5 The servant said to him, “What if the woman is not willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?”
GEN 24:6 Abraham [Father of a multitude] said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again.
GEN 24:7 Adonai, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring. He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
GEN 24:8 If the woman is not willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.”
GEN 24:9 The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham [Father of a multitude] his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. (3)
GEN 24:10 The servant took ten camels, of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
GEN 24:11 He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
GEN 24:12 He said, “Adonai, the God of my master Abraham [Father of a multitude], please give me success today, and show chesed ·loving-kindness· to my master Abraham [Father of a multitude].
GEN 24:13 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
GEN 24:14 Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’ —let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac [Laughter]. By this I will know that you have shown chesed ·loving-kindness· to my master.”
GEN 24:15 Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah [Securely bound] came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.
GEN 24:16 The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.
GEN 24:17 The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”
GEN 24:18 She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.
GEN 24:19 When she had done giving him drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking.”
GEN 24:20 She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
GEN 24:21 The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Adonai had made his journey prosperous or not.
GEN 24:22 As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel [0.2 oz; 5.67 g], and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels [4 oz; 113.4 g] of gold,
GEN 24:23 and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in?”
GEN 24:24 She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”
GEN 24:25 She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.”
GEN 24:26 The man bowed his head, and worshiped Adonai. (4)
GEN 24:27 He said, “Blessed be Adonai, the God of my master Abraham [Father of a multitude], who has not forsaken his chesed ·loving-kindness· and his truth toward my master. As for me, Adonai has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.”
GEN 24:28 The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words.
GEN 24:29 Rebekah [Securely bound] had a brother, and his name was Laban [White]. Laban [White] ran out to the man, to the spring.
GEN 24:30 When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the words of Rebekah [Securely bound] his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
GEN 24:31 He said, “Come in, you blessed of Adonai. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.”
GEN 24:32 The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
GEN 24:33 Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.” He said, “Speak on.”
GEN 24:34 He said, “I am Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s servant.
GEN 24:35 Adonai has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
GEN 24:36 Sarah [Princess], my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.
GEN 24:37 My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled], in whose land I live,
GEN 24:38 but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’
GEN 24:39 I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’
GEN 24:40 He said to me, ‘Adonai, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house.
GEN 24:41 Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’
GEN 24:42 I came today to the spring, and said, ‘Adonai, the God of my master Abraham [Father of a multitude], if now you do prosper my way which I go—
GEN 24:43 behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”
GEN 24:44 and she will tell me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”— let her be the woman whom Adonai has appointed for my master’s son.’
GEN 24:45 Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah [Securely bound] came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’
GEN 24:46 She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.
GEN 24:47 I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.
GEN 24:48 I bowed my head, and worshiped Adonai, and blessed Adonai, the God of my master Abraham [Father of a multitude], who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.
GEN 24:49 Now if you will deal with chesed ·loving-kindness· and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.”
GEN 24:50 Then Laban [White] and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Adonai. We can’t speak to you bad or good.
GEN 24:51 Behold, Rebekah [Securely bound] is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Adonai has spoken.”
GEN 24:52 When Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s servant sh'ma ·heard obeyed· their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Adonai. (5)
GEN 24:53 The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah [Securely bound]. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother.
GEN 24:54 They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”
GEN 24:55 Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”
GEN 24:56 He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Adonai has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”
GEN 24:57 They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.”
GEN 24:58 They called Rebekah [Securely bound], and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.”
GEN 24:59 They sent away Rebekah [Securely bound], their sister, with her nurse, Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s servant, and his men.
GEN 24:60 They blessed Rebekah [Securely bound], and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.”
GEN 24:61 Rebekah [Securely bound] arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah [Securely bound], and went his way.
GEN 24:62 Isaac [Laughter] came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi [Well of the one who lives and sees], for he lived in the land of the South.
GEN 24:63 Isaac [Laughter] went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
GEN 24:64 Rebekah [Securely bound] lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac [Laughter], she dismounted from the camel.
GEN 24:65 She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” She took her veil, and covered herself.
GEN 24:66 The servant told Isaac [Laughter] all the things that he had done.
GEN 24:67 Isaac [Laughter] brought her into his mother Sarah [Princess]’s tent, and took Rebekah [Securely bound], and she became his wife. He 'ahav ·affectionately loved· her. Isaac [Laughter] was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN 25:1 Abraham [Father of a multitude] took another wife, and her name was Keturah [Incense].
GEN 25:2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian [Strife], Ishbak, and Shuah.
GEN 25:3 Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
GEN 25:4 The sons of Midian [Strife] were: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah [Incense].
GEN 25:5 Abraham [Father of a multitude] gave all that he had to Isaac [Laughter],
GEN 25:6 but to the sons of Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s concubines, Abraham [Father of a multitude] gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac [Laughter] his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
GEN 25:7 These are the days of the years of Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.
GEN 25:8 Abraham [Father of a multitude] gave up his spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
GEN 25:9 Isaac [Laughter] and Ishmael [Pays attention God], his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah [Double], in the field of Ephron [Fawn-like], the son of Zohar the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], which is before Mamre [Bitter, Fatness],
GEN 25:10 the field which Abraham [Father of a multitude] purchased of the children of Heth [Trembling fear]. Abraham [Father of a multitude] was buried there with Sarah [Princess], his wife.
GEN 25:11 After the death of Abraham [Father of a multitude], God blessed Isaac [Laughter], his son. Isaac [Laughter] lived by Beer Lahai Roi [Well of the one who lives and sees]. (7)
GEN 25:12 Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael [Pays attention God], Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s son, whom Hagar [Flight] the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], Sarah [Princess]’s servant, bore to Abraham [Father of a multitude].
GEN 25:13 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael [Pays attention God], by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael [Pays attention God], Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
GEN 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
GEN 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael [Pays attention God], and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.
GEN 25:17 These are the years of the life of Ishmael [Pays attention God]: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.
GEN 25:18 They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt [Abode of slavery], as you go toward Assyria [Level plain]. He lived opposite all his relatives.
GEN 25:19 This is the history of the generations of Isaac [Laughter], Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s son. Abraham [Father of a multitude] became the father of Isaac [Laughter].
GEN 25:20 Isaac [Laughter] was forty years old when he took Rebekah [Securely bound], the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram [Elevated], the sister of Laban [White] the Syrian, to be his wife.
GEN 25:21 Isaac [Laughter] entreated Adonai for his wife, because she was barren. Adonai was entreated by him, and Rebekah [Securely bound] his wife conceived.
GEN 25:22 The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is so, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Adonai.
GEN 25:23 Adonai said to her, “Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.”
GEN 25:24 When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
GEN 25:25 The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau [Hairy].
GEN 25:26 After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau [Hairy]’s heel. He was named Jacob [Supplanter]. Isaac [Laughter] was sixty years old when she bore them.
GEN 25:27 The boys grew. Esau [Hairy] was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob [Supplanter] was a quiet man, living in tents.
GEN 25:28 Now Isaac [Laughter] 'ahav ·affectionately loved· Esau [Hairy], because he ate Esau’s venison. Rebekah [Securely bound] 'ahav ·affectionately loved· Jacob [Supplanter].
GEN 25:29 Jacob [Supplanter] boiled stew. Esau [Hairy] came in from the field, and he was famished.
GEN 25:30 Esau [Hairy] said to Jacob [Supplanter], “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom [Red].
GEN 25:31 Jacob [Supplanter] said, “First, sell me your birthright.”
GEN 25:32 Esau [Hairy] said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”
GEN 25:33 Jacob [Supplanter] said, “Swear to me first.” He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob [Supplanter].
GEN 25:34 Jacob [Supplanter] gave Esau [Hairy] bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau [Hairy] despised his birthright.
GEN 26:1 There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham [Father of a multitude]. Isaac [Laughter] went to Abimelech [My father king] king of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)], to Gerar.
GEN 26:2 Adonai appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Live in the land I will tell you about.
GEN 26:3 Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham [Father of a multitude] your father.
GEN 26:4 I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. By your seed, all the nations of the earth be blessed,
GEN 26:5 because Abraham [Father of a multitude] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my voice, and heeded what I told him to do— he followed my mitzvot ·instructions·, my regulations, and my torot ·teachings·.” (2)
GEN 26:6 Isaac [Laughter] lived in Gerar.
GEN 26:7 The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife,” lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah [Securely bound], because she is beautiful to look at.”
GEN 26:8 When he had been there a long time, Abimelech [My father king] king of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [Laughter] was caressing Rebekah [Securely bound], his wife.
GEN 26:9 Abimelech [My father king] called Isaac [Laughter], and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’” Isaac [Laughter] said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”
GEN 26:10 Abimelech [My father king] said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought fault incurring guilt on us!”
GEN 26:11 Abimelech [My father king] enjoined all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”
GEN 26:12 Isaac [Laughter] sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Adonai blessed him. (3)
GEN 26:13 The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.
GEN 26:14 He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] envied him.
GEN 26:15 Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham [Father of a multitude] his father, the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] had stopped, and filled with earth.
GEN 26:16 Abimelech [My father king] said to Isaac [Laughter], “Go from us, for you are much mightier than we.”
GEN 26:17 Isaac [Laughter] departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
GEN 26:18 Isaac [Laughter] dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham [Father of a multitude] his father. For the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] had stopped them after the death of Abraham [Father of a multitude]. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
GEN 26:19 Isaac [Laughter]’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
GEN 26:20 The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac [Laughter]’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
GEN 26:21 They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.
GEN 26:22 He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now Adonai has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.” (4)
GEN 26:23 He went up from there to Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath].
GEN 26:24 Adonai appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude] your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s sake.”
GEN 26:25 He built an altar there, and called on Adonai’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac [Laughter]’s servants dug a well.
GEN 26:26 Then Abimelech [My father king] went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.
GEN 26:27 Isaac [Laughter] said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”
GEN 26:28 They said, “We saw plainly that Adonai was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with you,
GEN 26:29 that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of Adonai.” (5)
GEN 26:30 He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
GEN 26:31 They rose up some time in the morning, and swore to one another. Isaac [Laughter] sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
GEN 26:32 The same day, Isaac [Laughter]’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”
GEN 26:33 He called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath] to this day.
GEN 26:34 When Esau [Hairy] was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear].
GEN 26:35 They grieved Isaac [Laughter]’s and Rebekah [Securely bound]’s spirits.
GEN 27:1 When Isaac [Laughter] was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau [Hairy] his elder son, and said to him, “My son?” He said to him, “Here I am.”
GEN 27:2 He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death.
GEN 27:3 Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.
GEN 27:4 Make me savory food, such as I 'ahav ·affectionately love·, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.”
GEN 27:5 Rebekah [Securely bound] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· when Isaac [Laughter] spoke to Esau [Hairy] his son. Esau [Hairy] went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
GEN 27:6 Rebekah [Securely bound] spoke to Jacob [Supplanter] her son, saying, “Behold, I sh'ma ·heard obeyed· your father speak to Esau [Hairy] your brother, saying,
GEN 27:7 ‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Adonai before my death.’
GEN 27:8 Now therefore, my son, sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice according to that which I enjoin you.
GEN 27:9 Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good young goats. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he 'ahav ·affectionately loves·.
GEN 27:10 You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”
GEN 27:11 Jacob [Supplanter] said to Rebekah [Securely bound] his mother, “Behold, Esau [Hairy] my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
GEN 27:12 What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.”
GEN 27:13 His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice, and go get them for me.”
GEN 27:14 He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father 'ahav ·affectionately loved·.
GEN 27:15 Rebekah [Securely bound] took the good clothes of Esau [Hairy], her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob [Supplanter], her younger son.
GEN 27:16 She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.
GEN 27:17 She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob [Supplanter].
GEN 27:18 He came to his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”
GEN 27:19 Jacob [Supplanter] said to his father, “I am Esau [Hairy] your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”
GEN 27:20 Isaac [Laughter] said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He said, “Because Adonai your God gave me success.”
GEN 27:21 Isaac [Laughter] said to Jacob [Supplanter], “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau [Hairy] or not.”
GEN 27:22 Jacob [Supplanter] went near to Isaac [Laughter] his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob [Supplanter]’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau [Hairy].”
GEN 27:23 He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau [Hairy]’s hands. So he blessed him.
GEN 27:24 He said, “Are you really my son Esau [Hairy]?” He said, “I am.”
GEN 27:25 He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.” He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.
GEN 27:26 His father Isaac [Laughter] said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”
GEN 27:27 He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Adonai has blessed. (6)
GEN 27:28 God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.
GEN 27:29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers. Let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you.”
GEN 27:30 As soon as Isaac [Laughter] had finished blessing Jacob [Supplanter], and Jacob [Supplanter] had just gone out from the presence of Isaac [Laughter] his father, Esau [Hairy] his brother came in from his hunting.
GEN 27:31 He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.”
GEN 27:32 Isaac [Laughter] his father said to him, “Who are you?” He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau [Hairy].”
GEN 27:33 Isaac [Laughter] trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.”
GEN 27:34 When Esau [Hairy] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”
GEN 27:35 He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”
GEN 27:36 He said, “Is not he rightly named Jacob [Supplanter]? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”
GEN 27:37 Isaac [Laughter] answered Esau [Hairy], “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?”
GEN 27:38 Esau [Hairy] said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau [Hairy] lifted up his voice, and wept.
GEN 27:39 Isaac [Laughter] his father answered him, “Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.
GEN 27:40 By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck.”
GEN 27:41 Esau [Hairy] hated Jacob [Supplanter] because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau [Hairy] said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob [Supplanter].”
GEN 27:42 The words of Esau [Hairy], her elder son, were told to Rebekah [Securely bound]. She sent and called Jacob [Supplanter], her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau [Hairy] comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
GEN 27:43 Now therefore, my son, sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice. Arise, flee to Laban [White], my brother, in Haran [Mountaineer].
GEN 27:44 Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away;
GEN 27:45 until your brother’s anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”
GEN 27:46 Rebekah [Securely bound] said to Isaac [Laughter], “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth [Trembling fear]. If Jacob [Supplanter] takes a wife of the daughters of Heth [Trembling fear], such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”
GEN 28:1 Isaac [Laughter] called Jacob [Supplanter], blessed him, and enjoined him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 28:2 Arise, go to Paddan Aram [Elevated], to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban [White], your mother’s brother.
GEN 28:3 May El Shaddai [God Almighty] bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,
GEN 28:4 and give you the blessing of Abraham [Father of a multitude], to you, and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham [Father of a multitude].” (7)
GEN 28:5 Isaac [Laughter] sent Jacob [Supplanter] away. He went to Paddan Aram [Elevated] to Laban [White], son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah [Securely bound]’s brother, Jacob [Supplanter]’s and Esau [Hairy]’s mother.
GEN 28:6 Now Esau [Hairy] saw that Isaac [Laughter] had blessed Jacob [Supplanter] and sent him away to Paddan Aram [Elevated], to take him a wife from there, and as he blessed him, Issac [Laughter] enjoined these words to Esau [Hairy], saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan [Humbled],” (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 28:7 and that Jacob [Supplanter] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram [Elevated].
GEN 28:8 Esau [Hairy] saw that the daughters of Canaan [Humbled] didn’t please Isaac [Laughter], his father.
GEN 28:9 Esau [Hairy] went to Ishmael [Pays attention God], and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael [Pays attention God], Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
GEN 28:10 Jacob [Supplanter] went out from Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath], and went toward Haran [Mountaineer].
GEN 28:11 He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
GEN 28:12 He dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
GEN 28:13 Behold, Adonai stood above it, and said, “I am Adonai, the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude] your father, and the God of Isaac [Laughter]. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your offspring.
GEN 28:14 Your offspring will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your offspring will all the families of the earth be blessed.
GEN 28:15 Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you.”
GEN 28:16 Jacob [Supplanter] awakened out of his sleep, and he said, “Surely Adonai is in this place, and I didn’t know it.”
GEN 28:17 He was afraid, and said, “How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.”
GEN 28:18 Jacob [Supplanter] rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.
GEN 28:19 He called the name of that place Beth-el [House of God], but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
GEN 28:20 Jacob [Supplanter] vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,
GEN 28:21 so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and Adonai will be my God,
GEN 28:22 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God’s house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give a tenth to you.”
GEN 29:1 Then Jacob [Supplanter] went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.
GEN 29:2 He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was large.
GEN 29:3 There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in its place.
GEN 29:4 Jacob [Supplanter] said to them, “My relatives, where are you from?” They said, “We are from Haran [Mountaineer].”
GEN 29:5 He said to them, “Do you know Laban [White], the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”
GEN 29:6 He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well. See, Rachel [Ewe sheep], his daughter, is coming with the sheep.”
GEN 29:7 He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”
GEN 29:8 They said, “We can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.”
GEN 29:9 While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel [Ewe sheep] came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them.
GEN 29:10 When Jacob [Supplanter] saw Rachel [Ewe sheep] the daughter of Laban [White], his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban [White], his mother’s brother, Jacob [Supplanter] went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban [White] his mother’s brother.
GEN 29:11 Jacob [Supplanter] kissed Rachel [Ewe sheep], and lifted up his voice, and wept.
GEN 29:12 Jacob [Supplanter] told Rachel [Ewe sheep] that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah [Securely bound]’s son. She ran and told her father.
GEN 29:13 When Laban [White] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the news of Jacob [Supplanter], his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob [Supplanter], and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob [Supplanter] told Laban [White] all these things.
GEN 29:14 Laban [White] said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” He lived with him for a month.
GEN 29:15 Laban [White] said to Jacob [Supplanter], “Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?”
GEN 29:16 Laban [White] had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah [Weary], and the name of the younger was Rachel [Ewe sheep].
GEN 29:17 Leah [Weary]’s eyes were weak, but Rachel [Ewe sheep] was beautiful in form and attractive. (3)
GEN 29:18 Jacob [Supplanter] 'ahav ·affectionately loved· Rachel [Ewe sheep]. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel [Ewe sheep], your younger daughter.”
GEN 29:19 Laban [White] said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”
GEN 29:20 Jacob [Supplanter] served seven years for Rachel [Ewe sheep]. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.
GEN 29:21 Jacob [Supplanter] said to Laban [White], “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”
GEN 29:22 Laban [White] gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
GEN 29:23 In the evening, he took Leah [Weary] his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.
GEN 29:24 Laban [White] gave Zilpah [Frailty] his servant to his daughter Leah [Weary] for a servant.
GEN 29:25 In the morning, behold, it was Leah [Weary]. He said to Laban [White], “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel [Ewe sheep]? Why then have you deceived me?”
GEN 29:26 Laban [White] said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
GEN 29:27 Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years.”
GEN 29:28 Jacob [Supplanter] did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel [Ewe sheep] his daughter as wife.
GEN 29:29 Laban [White] gave to Rachel [Ewe sheep] his daughter Bilhah [Bashful], his servant, to be her servant.
GEN 29:30 He went in also to Rachel [Ewe sheep], yet he 'ahav ·affectionately loved· Rachel [Ewe sheep] more than Leah [Weary]. Jacob [Supplanter] served Laban [White] yet seven other years.
GEN 29:31 Adonai saw that Leah [Weary] was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel [Ewe sheep] was barren.
GEN 29:32 Leah [Weary] conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben [See, a son!]. For she said, “Because Adonai has looked at my affliction. For now my husband will 'ahav ·affectionately love· me.”
GEN 29:33 She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Adonai has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon [Hearing].
GEN 29:34 She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, “Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi [United with].
GEN 29:35 She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time will I yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai.” Therefore she named him Judah [Praised]. Then she stopped bearing.
GEN 30:1 When Rachel [Ewe sheep] saw that she bore Jacob [Supplanter] no children, Rachel [Ewe sheep] envied her sister. She said to Jacob [Supplanter], “Give me children, or else I will die.”
GEN 30:2 Jacob [Supplanter]’s anger burned against Rachel [Ewe sheep], and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
GEN 30:3 She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah [Bashful]. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.”
GEN 30:4 She gave him Bilhah [Bashful] her servant as wife, and Jacob [Supplanter] went in to her.
GEN 30:5 Bilhah [Bashful] conceived, and bore Jacob [Supplanter] a son.
GEN 30:6 Rachel [Ewe sheep] said, “God has judged me, and has also sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore called she his name Dan [He judged].
GEN 30:7 Bilhah [Bashful], Rachel [Ewe sheep]’s servant, conceived again, and bore Jacob [Supplanter] a second son.
GEN 30:8 Rachel [Ewe sheep] said, “With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali [My wrestling].
GEN 30:9 When Leah [Weary] saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah [Frailty], her servant, and gave her to Jacob [Supplanter] as a wife.
GEN 30:10 Zilpah [Frailty], Leah [Weary]’s servant, bore Jacob [Supplanter] a son.
GEN 30:11 Leah [Weary] said, “How fortunate!” She named him Gad [Good fortune].
GEN 30:12 Zilpah [Frailty], Leah [Weary]’s servant, bore Jacob [Supplanter] a second son.
GEN 30:13 Leah [Weary] said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named him Asher [Happy]. (4)
GEN 30:14 Reuben [See, a son!] went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah [Weary]. Then Rachel [Ewe sheep] said to Leah [Weary], “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN 30:15 She said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?” Rachel [Ewe sheep] said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN 30:16 Jacob [Supplanter] came from the field in the evening, and Leah [Weary] went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” He lay with her that night.
GEN 30:17 God sh'ma ·heard obeyed· to Leah [Weary], and she conceived, and bore Jacob [Supplanter] a fifth son.
GEN 30:18 Leah [Weary] said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my servant to my husband.” She named him Issachar [Hire, Reward].
GEN 30:19 Leah [Weary] conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob [Supplanter].
GEN 30:20 Leah [Weary] said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons.” She named him Zebulun [Living together].
GEN 30:21 Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.
GEN 30:22 God remembered Rachel [Ewe sheep], and God sh'ma ·heard obeyed· to her, and opened her womb.
GEN 30:23 She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”
GEN 30:24 She named him Joseph [May he add], saying, “May Adonai add another son to me.”
GEN 30:25 When Rachel [Ewe sheep] had borne Joseph [May he add], Jacob [Supplanter] said to Laban [White], “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
GEN 30:26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.”
GEN 30:27 Laban [White] said to him, “If now I have found chen ·grace· in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Adonai has blessed me for your sake.” (5)
GEN 30:28 He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.”
GEN 30:29 He said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.
GEN 30:30 For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Adonai has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?”
GEN 30:31 He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob [Supplanter] said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.
GEN 30:32 I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.
GEN 30:33 So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.”
GEN 30:34 Laban [White] said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”
GEN 30:35 That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
GEN 30:36 He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob [Supplanter], and Jacob [Supplanter] fed the rest of Laban [White]’s flocks.
GEN 30:37 Jacob [Supplanter] took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
GEN 30:38 He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.
GEN 30:39 The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted.
GEN 30:40 Jacob [Supplanter] separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban [White]: and he put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban [White]’s flock.
GEN 30:41 Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob [Supplanter] laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
GEN 30:42 but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the more feeble were Laban [White]’s, and the stronger Jacob [Supplanter]’s.
GEN 30:43 The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
GEN 31:1 He sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the words of Laban [White]’s sons, saying, “Jacob [Supplanter] has taken away all that was our father’s. From that which was our father’s, has he gotten all this wealth.”
GEN 31:2 Jacob [Supplanter] saw the expression on Laban [White]’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
GEN 31:3 Adonai said to Jacob [Supplanter], “Teshuvah ·Completely return· to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”
GEN 31:4 Jacob [Supplanter] sent and called Rachel [Ewe sheep] and Leah [Weary] to the field to his flock,
GEN 31:5 and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
GEN 31:6 You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.
GEN 31:7 Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me.
GEN 31:8 If he said this, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked.
GEN 31:9 Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me.
GEN 31:10 During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
GEN 31:11 Ha mal'ak Elohim [The Angel of God] said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob [Supplanter],’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’
GEN 31:12 He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban [White] does to you.
GEN 31:13 I am HaEl Beit-El [the God of House of God], where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and teshuvah ·completely return· to the land of your birth.’”
GEN 31:14 Rachel [Ewe sheep] and Leah [Weary] answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
GEN 31:15 Are not we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.
GEN 31:16 For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.” (6)
GEN 31:17 Then Jacob [Supplanter] rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,
GEN 31:18 and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram [Elevated], to go to Isaac [Laughter] his father, to the land of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 31:19 Now Laban [White] had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel [Ewe sheep] stole the household deities that were her father’s.
GEN 31:20 Jacob [Supplanter] deceived Laban [White] the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away.
GEN 31:21 So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
GEN 31:22 Laban [White] was told on the third day that Jacob [Supplanter] had fled.
GEN 31:23 He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
GEN 31:24 God came to Laban [White], the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob [Supplanter] either good or bad.”
GEN 31:25 Laban [White] caught up with Jacob [Supplanter]. Now Jacob [Supplanter] had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban [White] with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
GEN 31:26 Laban [White] said to Jacob [Supplanter], “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?
GEN 31:27 Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;
GEN 31:28 and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.
GEN 31:29 It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob [Supplanter] either good or bad.’
GEN 31:30 Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my deities?”
GEN 31:31 Jacob [Supplanter] answered Laban [White], “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’
GEN 31:32 Anyone you find your deities with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob [Supplanter] didn’t know that Rachel [Ewe sheep] had stolen them.
GEN 31:33 Laban [White] went into Jacob [Supplanter]’s tent, into Leah [Weary]’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah [Weary]’s tent, and entered into Rachel [Ewe sheep]’s tent.
GEN 31:34 Now Rachel [Ewe sheep] had taken the household deities, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban [White] felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them.
GEN 31:35 She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the household deities.
GEN 31:36 Jacob [Supplanter] was angry, and argued with Laban [White]. Jacob [Supplanter] answered Laban [White], “What is my rebellious breach of relationship? What is my habitual sin ·missing the mark·, that you have hotly pursued me?
GEN 31:37 Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
GEN 31:38 “These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks.
GEN 31:39 That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its sin ·err (the standard goal)·. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
GEN 31:40 This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.
GEN 31:41 These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
GEN 31:42 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], and the fear of Isaac [Laughter], had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.” (7)
GEN 31:43 Laban [White] answered Jacob [Supplanter], “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
GEN 31:44 Now come, let us make a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.”
GEN 31:45 Jacob [Supplanter] took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
GEN 31:46 Jacob [Supplanter] said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.
GEN 31:47 Laban [White] called it Jegar Sahadutha [Heap of witness], but Jacob [Supplanter] called it Galeed [Heap of stones, Heap of witness].
GEN 31:48 Laban [White] said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore it was named Galeed [Heap of stones, Heap of witness]
GEN 31:49 and Mizpah, for he said, “Adonai watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.
GEN 31:50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.”
GEN 31:51 Laban [White] said to Jacob [Supplanter], “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.
GEN 31:52 May this heap and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
GEN 31:53 The God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob [Supplanter] swore by the fear of his father, Isaac [Laughter].
GEN 31:54 Jacob [Supplanter] offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 31:55 Early in the morning, Laban [White] rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban [White] departed and returned to his place.
GEN 32:1 Jacob [Supplanter] went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
GEN 32:2 When he saw them, Jacob [Supplanter] said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim [Two camps].
GEN 32:3 Jacob [Supplanter] sent messengers in front of him to Esau [Hairy], his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom [Red].
GEN 32:4 He enjoined them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau [Hairy]: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob [Supplanter], says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban [White], and stayed until now.
GEN 32:5 I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find chen ·grace· in your sight.’”
GEN 32:6 The messengers returned to Jacob [Supplanter], saying, “We came to your brother Esau [Hairy]. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.”
GEN 32:7 Then Jacob [Supplanter] was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
GEN 32:8 and he said, “If Esau [Hairy] comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.”
GEN 32:9 Jacob [Supplanter] said, “God of my father Abraham [Father of a multitude], and God of my father Isaac [Laughter], Adonai, who said to me, ‘Teshuvah ·Completely return· to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’
GEN 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the chesed ·loving-kindnesses·, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan [Descender]; and now I have become two companies.
GEN 32:11 Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau [Hairy]: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children.
GEN 32:12 You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’” (2)
GEN 32:13 He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau [Hairy], his brother:
GEN 32:14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
GEN 32:15 thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.
GEN 32:16 He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.”
GEN 32:17 He enjoined the foremost, saying, “When Esau [Hairy], my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’
GEN 32:18 Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob [Supplanter]’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau [Hairy]. Behold, he also is behind us.’”
GEN 32:19 He enjoined also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau [Hairy], when you find him.
GEN 32:20 You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob [Supplanter], is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”
GEN 32:21 So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
GEN 32:22 He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.
GEN 32:23 He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
GEN 32:24 Jacob [Supplanter] was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.
GEN 32:25 When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob [Supplanter]’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled.
GEN 32:26 The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.” Jacob [Supplanter] said, “I won’t let you go, unless you bless me.”
GEN 32:27 He said to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob [Supplanter]”.
GEN 32:28 He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob [Supplanter], but Israel [Wrestles with God / God prevails]; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.”
GEN 32:29 Jacob [Supplanter] asked him, “Please tell me your name.” He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” and he blessed him there. (3)
GEN 32:30 Jacob [Supplanter] called the name of the place Peniel [Face of God]: for, he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”
GEN 32:31 The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel [Face of God], and he limped because of his thigh.
GEN 32:32 Therefore the children of Israel [God prevails] don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob [Supplanter]’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
GEN 33:1 Jacob [Supplanter] lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau [Hairy] was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah [Weary], Rachel [Ewe sheep], and the two servants.
GEN 33:2 He put the servants and their children in front, Leah [Weary] and her children after, and Rachel [Ewe sheep] and Joseph [May he add] at the rear.
GEN 33:3 He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
GEN 33:4 Esau [Hairy] ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.
GEN 33:5 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?” He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” (4)
GEN 33:6 Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.
GEN 33:7 Leah [Weary] also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph [May he add] came near with Rachel [Ewe sheep], and they bowed themselves.
GEN 33:8 Esau [Hairy] said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?” Jacob [Supplanter] said, “To find chen ·grace· in the sight of my lord.”
GEN 33:9 Esau [Hairy] said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”
GEN 33:10 Jacob [Supplanter] said, “Please, now, if I have now found chen ·grace· in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.
GEN 33:11 Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.
GEN 33:12 Esau [Hairy] said, “Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.”
GEN 33:13 Jacob [Supplanter] said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
GEN 33:14 Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”
GEN 33:15 Esau [Hairy] said, “Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.” He said, “Why? Let me find chen ·grace· in the sight of my lord.”
GEN 33:16 So Esau [Hairy] teshuvah ·completely returned· that day on his way to Seir.
GEN 33:17 Jacob [Supplanter] traveled to Sukkot, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Sukkot [Booths].
GEN 33:18 Jacob [Supplanter] came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan [Humbled], when he came from Paddan Aram [Elevated]; and encamped before the city.
GEN 33:19 He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money.
GEN 33:20 He erected an altar there, and called it El-Elohei-Isra'el [God the God of God prevails].
GEN 34:1 Dinah, the daughter of Leah [Weary], whom she bore to Jacob [Supplanter], went out to see the daughters of the land.
GEN 34:2 Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite [Wicked], the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.
GEN 34:3 His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob [Supplanter], and he 'ahav ·affectionately loved· the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.
GEN 34:4 Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”
GEN 34:5 Now Jacob [Supplanter] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob [Supplanter] held his peace until they came.
GEN 34:6 Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob [Supplanter] to talk with him.
GEN 34:7 The sons of Jacob [Supplanter] came in from the field when they sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel [God prevails] in lying with Jacob [Supplanter]’s daughter; a thing ought not to be done.
GEN 34:8 Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, has chasak ·set his affection· on your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.
GEN 34:9 Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
GEN 34:10 You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.”
GEN 34:11 Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find chen ·grace· in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.
GEN 34:12 Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.”
GEN 34:13 The sons of Jacob [Supplanter] answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
GEN 34:14 and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.
GEN 34:15 Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;
GEN 34:16 then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
GEN 34:17 But if you will not sh'ma ·hear obey· unto us, to be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone.”
GEN 34:18 Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.
GEN 34:19 The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob [Supplanter]’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.
GEN 34:20 Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,
GEN 34:21 “These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
GEN 34:22 Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.
GEN 34:23 Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”
GEN 34:24 All who went out of the gate of his city sh'ma ·heard obeyed· to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
GEN 34:25 On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob [Supplanter]’s sons, Simeon [Hearing] and Levi [United with], Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.
GEN 34:26 They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.
GEN 34:27 Jacob [Supplanter]’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
GEN 34:28 They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,
GEN 34:29 and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.
GEN 34:30 Jacob [Supplanter] said to Simeon [Hearing] and Levi [United with], “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled] and the Perizzites [Descendants of Belonging to village]. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”
GEN 34:31 They said, “Should we allow him to deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”
GEN 35:1 God said to Jacob [Supplanter], “Arise, go up to Beth-el [House of God], and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau [Hairy] your brother.”
GEN 35:2 Then Jacob [Supplanter] said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign deities that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.
GEN 35:3 Let us arise, and go up to Beth-el [House of God]. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.”
GEN 35:4 They gave to Jacob [Supplanter] all the foreign deities which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob [Supplanter] hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
GEN 35:5 They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob [Supplanter].
GEN 35:6 So Jacob [Supplanter] came to Luz (that is, Beth-el [House of God]), which is in the land of Canaan [Humbled], he and all the people who were with him.
GEN 35:7 He built an altar there, and called the place El Beit-El [God of House of God]; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
GEN 35:8 Deborah, Rebekah [Securely bound]’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Beth-el [House of God] under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.
GEN 35:9 God appeared to Jacob [Supplanter] again, when he came from Paddan Aram [Elevated], and blessed him.
GEN 35:10 God said to him, “Your name is Jacob [Supplanter]. Your name shall not be Jacob [Supplanter] any more, but your name will be Israel [Wrestles with God / God prevails].” He named him Israel [God prevails].
GEN 35:11 God said to him, “I am El Shaddai [God Almighty]. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body. (A:6)
GEN 35:12 The land which I gave to Abraham [Father of a multitude] and Isaac [Laughter], I will give it to you, and to your offspring after you will I give the land.”
GEN 35:13 God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him. (S:6)
GEN 35:14 Jacob [Supplanter] set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
GEN 35:15 Jacob [Supplanter] called the name of the place where God spoke with him “Beth-el [House of God]”.
GEN 35:16 They traveled from Beth-el [House of God]. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel [Ewe sheep] travailed. She had hard labor.
GEN 35:17 When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for now you will have another son.”
GEN 35:18 As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south].
GEN 35:19 Rachel [Ewe sheep] died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem [House of Bread]).
GEN 35:20 Jacob [Supplanter] set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel [Ewe sheep]’s grave to this day.
GEN 35:21 Israel [God prevails] traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
GEN 35:22 While Israel [God prevails] lived in that land, Reuben [See, a son!] went and lay with Bilhah [Bashful], his father’s concubine, and Israel [God prevails] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of it. Now the sons of Jacob [Supplanter] were twelve.
GEN 35:23 The sons of Leah [Weary]: Reuben [See, a son!] (Jacob [Supplanter]’s firstborn), Simeon [Hearing], Levi [United with], Judah [Praised], Issachar [Hire, Reward], and Zebulun [Living together].
GEN 35:24 The sons of Rachel [Ewe sheep]: Joseph [May he add] and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south].
GEN 35:25 The sons of Bilhah [Bashful] (Rachel [Ewe sheep]’s servant): Dan [He judged] and Naphtali [My wrestling].
GEN 35:26 The sons of Zilpah [Frailty] (Leah [Weary]’s servant): Gad [Good fortune] and Asher [Happy]. These are the sons of Jacob [Supplanter], who were born to him in Paddan Aram [Elevated].
GEN 35:27 Jacob [Supplanter] came to Isaac [Laughter] his father, to Mamre [Bitter, Fatness], to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham [Father of a multitude] and Isaac [Laughter] lived as foreigners.
GEN 35:28 The days of Isaac [Laughter] were one hundred eighty years.
GEN 35:29 Isaac [Laughter] gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau [Hairy] and Jacob [Supplanter], his sons, buried him.
GEN 36:1 Now this is the history of the generations of Esau [Hairy] (that is, Edom [Red]).
GEN 36:2 Esau [Hairy] took his wives from the daughters of Canaan [Humbled]: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear]; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite [Wicked];
GEN 36:3 and Basemath, Ishmael [Pays attention God]’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
GEN 36:4 Adah bore to Esau [Hairy] Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel.
GEN 36:5 Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korach [Bald one, Frost]. These are the sons of Esau [Hairy], who were born to him in the land of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 36:6 Esau [Hairy] took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan [Humbled], and went into a land away from his brother Jacob [Supplanter].
GEN 36:7 For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their travels couldn’t bear them because of their livestock.
GEN 36:8 Esau [Hairy] lived in the hill country of Seir. Esau [Hairy] is Edom [Red].
GEN 36:9 This is the history of the generations of Esau [Hairy] the father of the Edomites [Red] in the hill country of Seir:
GEN 36:10 these are the names of Esau [Hairy]’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau [Hairy]; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau [Hairy].
GEN 36:11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
GEN 36:12 Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau [Hairy]’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek [Man who licks up]. These are the sons of Adah, Esau [Hairy]’s wife.
GEN 36:13 These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau [Hairy]’s wife.
GEN 36:14 These were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau [Hairy]’s wife: she bore to Esau [Hairy] Jeush, Jalam, and Korach [Bald one, Frost].
GEN 36:15 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau [Hairy]: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau [Hairy]: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
GEN 36:16 chief Korach [Bald one, Frost], chief Gatam, chief Amalek [Man who licks up]: these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom [Red]; these are the sons of Adah.
GEN 36:17 These are the sons of Reuel, Esau [Hairy]’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom [Red]; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau [Hairy]’s wife.
GEN 36:18 These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau [Hairy]’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korach [Bald one, Frost]: these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau [Hairy]’s wife.
GEN 36:19 These are the sons of Esau [Hairy] (that is, Edom [Red]), and these are their chiefs. (7)
GEN 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
GEN 36:21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom [Red].
GEN 36:22 The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna.
GEN 36:23 These are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN 36:24 These are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father.
GEN 36:25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
GEN 36:26 These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
GEN 36:27 These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN 36:28 These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
GEN 36:29 These are the chiefs who came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
GEN 36:30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
GEN 36:31 These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom [Red], before any king reigned over the children of Israel [God prevails].
GEN 36:32 Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom [Red]. The name of his city was Dinhabah.
GEN 36:33 Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place.
GEN 36:34 Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
GEN 36:35 Husham died, and Hadad, the son of Bedad, who struck Midian [Strife] in the field of Moab [From father], reigned in his place. The name of his city was Avith.
GEN 36:36 Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.
GEN 36:37 Samlah died, and Shaul [Asked for] of Rehoboth by the river, reigned in his place.
GEN 36:38 Shaul [Asked for] died, and Baal Hanan, the son of Achbor reigned in his place.
GEN 36:39 Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place. The name of his city was Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 36:40 These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau [Hairy], according to their families, after their places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
GEN 36:41 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
GEN 36:42 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
GEN 36:43 chief Magdiel, and chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom [Red], according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau [Hairy], the father of the Edomites [Red].
GEN 37:1 Jacob [Supplanter] lived in the land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 37:2 This is the history of the generations of Jacob [Supplanter]. Joseph [May he add], being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah [Bashful] and Zilpah [Frailty], his father’s wives. Joseph [May he add] brought an evil report of them to their father.
GEN 37:3 Now Israel [God prevails] 'ahav ·affectionately loved· Joseph [May he add] more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors.
GEN 37:4 His brothers saw that their father 'ahav ·affectionately loved· him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn’t speak peaceably to him.
GEN 37:5 Joseph [May he add] dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.
GEN 37:6 He said to them, “Please sh'ma ·hear obey· this dream which I have dreamed:
GEN 37:7 for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.”
GEN 37:8 His brothers said to him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.
GEN 37:9 He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.”
GEN 37:10 He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?”
GEN 37:11 His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind. (2)
GEN 37:12 His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
GEN 37:13 Israel [God prevails] said to Joseph [May he add], “Are not your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.”
GEN 37:14 He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
GEN 37:15 A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?”
GEN 37:16 He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.”
GEN 37:17 The man said, “They have left here, for I sh'ma ·heard obeyed· them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” Joseph [May he add] went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.
GEN 37:18 They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.
GEN 37:19 They said to one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes.
GEN 37:20 Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will become of his dreams.”
GEN 37:21 Reuben [See, a son!] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.”
GEN 37:22 Reuben [See, a son!] said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”— that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. (3)
GEN 37:23 When Joseph [May he add] came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph [May he add] of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;
GEN 37:24 and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
GEN 37:25 They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites [Pays attention God] was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 37:26 Judah [Praised] said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
GEN 37:27 Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites [Pays attention God], and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers sh'ma ·heard obeyed· him.
GEN 37:28 Midianites [Descendants of Strife] who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph [May he add] out of the pit, and sold Joseph [May he add] to the Ishmaelites [Pays attention God] for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph [May he add] into Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 37:29 Reuben [See, a son!] returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph [May he add] was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes.
GEN 37:30 He teshuvah ·completely returned· to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?”
GEN 37:31 They took Joseph [May he add]’s coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.
GEN 37:32 They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son’s coat or not.”
GEN 37:33 He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph [May he add] is without doubt torn in pieces.”
GEN 37:34 Jacob [Supplanter] tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days.
GEN 37:35 All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol ·Place of the dead· to my son mourning.” His father wept for him.
GEN 37:36 The Midianites [Descendants of Strife] sold him into Egypt [Abode of slavery] to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.
GEN 38:1 At that time, Judah [Praised] went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
GEN 38:2 Judah [Praised] saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled] whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her.
GEN 38:3 She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.
GEN 38:4 She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.
GEN 38:5 She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
GEN 38:6 Judah [Praised] took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar [Palm tree].
GEN 38:7 Er, Judah [Praised]’s firstborn, was wicked in Adonai’s sight. Adonai killed him.
GEN 38:8 Judah [Praised] said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”
GEN 38:9 Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.
GEN 38:10 The thing which he did was evil in Adonai’s sight, and he killed him also.
GEN 38:11 Then Judah [Praised] said to Tamar [Palm tree], his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar [Palm tree] went and lived in her father’s house.
GEN 38:12 After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah [Praised], died. Judah [Praised] was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.
GEN 38:13 Tamar [Palm tree] was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
GEN 38:14 She took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given to him as a wife.
GEN 38:15 When Judah [Praised] saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
GEN 38:16 He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
GEN 38:17 He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”
GEN 38:18 He said, “What pledge will I give you?” She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
GEN 38:19 She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
GEN 38:20 Judah [Praised] sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her.
GEN 38:21 Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?” They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”
GEN 38:22 He returned to Judah [Praised], and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’”
GEN 38:23 Judah [Praised] said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”
GEN 38:24 About three months later, Judah [Praised] was told, “Tamar [Palm tree], your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.” Judah [Praised] said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”
GEN 38:25 When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man, whose these are, I am with child.” She also said, “Please discern whose are these— the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”
GEN 38:26 Judah [Praised] acknowledged them, and said, “She is more upright than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.” He knew her again no more.
GEN 38:27 In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb.
GEN 38:28 When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.”
GEN 38:29 As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez.
GEN 38:30 Afterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.
GEN 39:1 Joseph [May he add] was brought down to Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites [Pays attention God] that had brought him down there.
GEN 39:2 Adonai was with Joseph [May he add], and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery].
GEN 39:3 His master saw that Adonai was with him, and that Adonai made all that he did prosper in his hand.
GEN 39:4 Joseph [May he add] found chen ·grace· in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
GEN 39:5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Adonai blessed the Egyptian’s [person from Abode of slavery] house for Joseph [May he add]’s sake. Adonai’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.
GEN 39:6 He left all that he had in Joseph [May he add]’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. Joseph [May he add] was well-built and handsome. (6)
GEN 39:7 After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph [May he add]; and she said, “Lie with me.”
GEN 39:8 But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.
GEN 39:9 No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin ·err (the standard goal)· against God?”
GEN 39:10 As she spoke to Joseph [May he add] day by day, he didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
GEN 39:11 About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.
GEN 39:12 She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.
GEN 39:13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,
GEN 39:14 she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew [Immigrant] to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
GEN 39:15 When he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”
GEN 39:16 She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.
GEN 39:17 She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew [Immigrant] servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,
GEN 39:18 and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”
GEN 39:19 When his master sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled.
GEN 39:20 Joseph [May he add]’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.
GEN 39:21 But Adonai was with Joseph [May he add], and showed chesed ·loving-kindness· to him, and gave him chen ·grace· in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
GEN 39:22 The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph [May he add]’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.
GEN 39:23 The keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because Adonai was with him; and that which he did, Adonai made it prosper.
GEN 40:1 After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] and his baker sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· against their lord, the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 40:2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer and the chief baker.
GEN 40:3 He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph [May he add] was bound.
GEN 40:4 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph [May he add], and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days.
GEN 40:5 They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery], who were bound in the prison.
GEN 40:6 Joseph [May he add] came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.
GEN 40:7 He asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?”
GEN 40:8 They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.” Joseph [May he add] said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.”
GEN 40:9 The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph [May he add], and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,
GEN 40:10 and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes.
GEN 40:11 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”
GEN 40:12 Joseph [May he add] said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
GEN 40:13 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did before his judgement, when you were his cup bearer.
GEN 40:14 But remember me when it will be well with you, and please show chesed ·loving-kindness· to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
GEN 40:15 For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews [Immigrants], and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.”
GEN 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph [May he add], “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
GEN 40:17 In the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”
GEN 40:18 Joseph [May he add] answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days.
GEN 40:19 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.” (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 40:20 On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
GEN 40:21 He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;
GEN 40:22 but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph [May he add] had interpreted to them.
GEN 40:23 Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph [May he add], but forgot him.
GEN 41:1 At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river.
GEN 41:2 Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.
GEN 41:3 Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river.
GEN 41:4 The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.
GEN 41:5 He slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.
GEN 41:6 Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
GEN 41:7 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
GEN 41:8 In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt [Abode of slavery]’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
GEN 41:9 Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my crimes deserving peanlty, sins ·missing the goal·today.
GEN 41:10 Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.
GEN 41:11 We dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
GEN 41:12 There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew [Immigrant], servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he interpreted.
GEN 41:13 As he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”
GEN 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph [May he add], and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. (A:2)
GEN 41:15 Pharaoh said to Joseph [May he add], “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it said of you, that when you sh'ma ·hear obey· a dream you can interpret it.”
GEN 41:16 Joseph [May he add] answered Pharaoh, saying, “It is not in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.” (S:2)
GEN 41:17 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph [May he add], “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river:
GEN 41:18 and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass,
GEN 41:19 and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] for ugliness.
GEN 41:20 The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,
GEN 41:21 and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
GEN 41:22 I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good:
GEN 41:23 and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
GEN 41:24 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”
GEN 41:25 Joseph [May he add] said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.
GEN 41:26 The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one.
GEN 41:27 The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
GEN 41:28 That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.
GEN 41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 41:30 There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. The famine will consume the land,
GEN 41:31 and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.
GEN 41:32 The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
GEN 41:33 “Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]’s produce in the seven plenteous years.
GEN 41:35 Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
GEN 41:36 The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; that the land not perish through the famine.”
GEN 41:37 The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
GEN 41:38 Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the breath mind Spirit of God?” (3)
GEN 41:39 Pharaoh said to Joseph [May he add], “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.
GEN 41:40 You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.”
GEN 41:41 Pharaoh said to Joseph [May he add], “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
GEN 41:42 Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph [May he add]’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,
GEN 41:43 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 41:44 Pharaoh said to Joseph [May he add], “I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
GEN 41:45 Pharaoh called Joseph [May he add]’s name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph [May he add] went out over the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 41:46 Joseph [May he add] was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Joseph [May he add] went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 41:47 In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.
GEN 41:48 He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up in the same.
GEN 41:49 Joseph [May he add] laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.
GEN 41:50 To Joseph [May he add] were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
GEN 41:51 Joseph [May he add] called the name of the firstborn Manasseh [Causing to forget], “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.”
GEN 41:52 The name of the second, he called Ephraim [Fruit]: “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” (4)
GEN 41:53 The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], came to an end.
GEN 41:54 The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph [May he add] had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] there was bread.
GEN 41:55 When all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], “Go to Joseph [May he add]. What he says to you, do.”
GEN 41:56 The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph [May he add] opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 41:57 All countries came into Egypt [Abode of slavery], to Joseph [May he add], to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
GEN 42:1 Now Jacob [Supplanter] saw that there was grain in Egypt [Abode of slavery], and Jacob [Supplanter] said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”
GEN 42:2 He said, “Behold, I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that there is grain in Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.”
GEN 42:3 Joseph [May he add]’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 42:4 But Jacob [Supplanter] didn’t send Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south], Joseph [May he add]’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.”
GEN 42:5 The sons of Israel [God prevails] came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 42:6 Joseph [May he add] was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph [May he add]’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.
GEN 42:7 Joseph [May he add] saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?” They said, “From the land of Canaan [Humbled] to buy food.”
GEN 42:8 Joseph [May he add] recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.
GEN 42:9 Joseph [May he add] remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
GEN 42:10 They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.
GEN 42:11 We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”
GEN 42:12 He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”
GEN 42:13 They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan [Humbled]; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”
GEN 42:14 Joseph [May he add] said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’
GEN 42:15 By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.
GEN 42:16 Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.”
GEN 42:17 He put them all together into custody for three days.
GEN 42:18 Joseph [May he add] said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God. (5)
GEN 42:19 If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.
GEN 42:20 Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.” They did so.
GEN 42:21 They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t sh'ma ·hear obey·. Therefore this distress has come upon us.”
GEN 42:22 Reuben [See, a son!] answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin ·err (the standard goal)· against the child,’ and you wouldn’t sh'ma ·hear obey·? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”
GEN 42:23 They didn’t know that Joseph [May he add] sh'ma ·hear understand obey· them; for there was an interpreter between them.
GEN 42:24 He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon [Hearing] from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
GEN 42:25 Then Joseph [May he add] gave an enjoinment to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
GEN 42:26 They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.
GEN 42:27 As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
GEN 42:28 He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”
GEN 42:29 They came to Jacob [Supplanter] their father, to the land of Canaan [Humbled], and told him all that had happened to them, saying,
GEN 42:30 “The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
GEN 42:31 We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies.
GEN 42:32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan [Humbled].’
GEN 42:33 The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.
GEN 42:34 Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”
GEN 42:35 As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
GEN 42:36 Jacob [Supplanter], their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph [May he add] is no more, Simeon [Hearing] is no more, and you want to take Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south] away. All these things are against me.”
GEN 42:37 Reuben [See, a son!] spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”
GEN 42:38 He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol ·Place of the dead·.”
GEN 43:1 The famine was severe in the land.
GEN 43:2 When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”
GEN 43:3 Judah [Praised] spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’
GEN 43:4 If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food,
GEN 43:5 but if you’ll not send him, we’ll not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’”
GEN 43:6 Israel [God prevails] said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”
GEN 43:7 They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’”
GEN 43:8 Judah [Praised] said to Israel [God prevails], his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.
GEN 43:9 I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the sin ·err (the standard goal)· forever,
GEN 43:10 for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”
GEN 43:11 Their father, Israel [God prevails], said to them, “If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;
GEN 43:12 and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
GEN 43:13 Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.
GEN 43:14 May El Shaddai [God Almighty] give you rachamim ·merciful loves· before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south]. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”
GEN 43:15 The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south]; and got up, went down to Egypt [Abode of slavery], and stood before Joseph [May he add]. (6)
GEN 43:16 When Joseph [May he add] saw Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south] with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”
GEN 43:17 The man did as Joseph [May he add] ordered, and the man brought the men to Joseph [May he add]’s house.
GEN 43:18 The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph [May he add]’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”
GEN 43:19 They came near to the steward of Joseph [May he add]’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,
GEN 43:20 and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.
GEN 43:21 When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.
GEN 43:22 We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”
GEN 43:23 He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon [Hearing] out to them.
GEN 43:24 The man brought the men into Joseph [May he add]’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.
GEN 43:25 They prepared the present for Joseph [May he add]’s coming at noon, for they sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that they should eat bread there.
GEN 43:26 When Joseph [May he add] came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth.
GEN 43:27 He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”
GEN 43:28 They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly.
GEN 43:29 He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south], his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.” (7)
GEN 43:30 Joseph [May he add] hurried, for in his rachamim ·bowels of compassionate merciful loves·, he yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.
GEN 43:31 He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”
GEN 43:32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] don’t eat bread with the Hebrews [Immigrants], for that is an abomination to the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].
GEN 43:33 They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another.
GEN 43:34 He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south]’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.
GEN 44:1 He enjoined the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
GEN 44:2 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph [May he add] had spoken.
GEN 44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.
GEN 44:4 When they had gone out of the city, and was not yet far off, Joseph [May he add] said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good?
GEN 44:5 Is not this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’”
GEN 44:6 He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.
GEN 44:7 They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!
GEN 44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan [Humbled]. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?
GEN 44:9 With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”
GEN 44:10 He said, “Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be blameless.”
GEN 44:11 Then they hurried, and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
GEN 44:12 He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south]’s sack.
GEN 44:13 Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city. (A: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 44:14 Judah [Praised] and his brothers came to Joseph [May he add]’s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him. (S: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 44:15 Joseph [May he add] said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?”
GEN 44:16 Judah [Praised] said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the depravity (moral evil) of your servants. Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.”
GEN 44:17 He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”
GEN 44:18 Then Judah [Praised] came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.
GEN 44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’
GEN 44:20 We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father 'ahav ·affectionately loves· him.’
GEN 44:21 You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’
GEN 44:22 We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’
GEN 44:23 You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.’
GEN 44:24 When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
GEN 44:25 Our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food.’
GEN 44:26 We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’
GEN 44:27 Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons:
GEN 44:28 and the one went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces;” and I haven’t seen him since.
GEN 44:29 If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol ·Place of the dead·.’
GEN 44:30 Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life; (2)
GEN 44:31 it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
GEN 44:32 For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the sin ·err (the standard goal)· before my father forever.’
GEN 44:33 Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers.
GEN 44:34 For how will I go up to my father, if the boy is not with me?— lest I see the evil that will come on my father.”
GEN 45:1 Then Joseph [May he add] couldn’t control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, “Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph [May he add] made himself known to his brothers.
GEN 45:2 He wept aloud. The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, and the house of Pharaoh sh'ma ·heard obeyed·.
GEN 45:3 Joseph [May he add] said to his brothers, “I am Joseph [May he add]! Does my father still live?” His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.
GEN 45:4 Joseph [May he add] said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” They came near. “He said, I am Joseph [May he add], your brother, whom you sold into Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 45:5 Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
GEN 45:6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be no plowing and no harvest.
GEN 45:7 God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance. (3)
GEN 45:8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 45:9 Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph [May he add] says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Come down to me. Don’t wait.
GEN 45:10 You shall dwell in the land of Goshen [Drawing near], and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.
GEN 45:11 There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.”’
GEN 45:12 Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south], that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
GEN 45:13 You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt [Abode of slavery], and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.”
GEN 45:14 He fell on his brother Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south]’s neck, and wept, and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south] wept on his neck.
GEN 45:15 He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.
GEN 45:16 The report of it was sh'ma ·heard obeyed· in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph [May he add]’s brothers have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
GEN 45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph [May he add], “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan [Humbled].
GEN 45:18 Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and you will eat the fat of the land.’ (4)
GEN 45:19 Now you are enjoined: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
GEN 45:20 Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] is yours.”
GEN 45:21 The sons of Israel [God prevails] did so. Joseph [May he add] gave them wagons, according to the order of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
GEN 45:22 He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south] he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.
GEN 45:23 He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.
GEN 45:24 So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See that you don’t quarrel on the way.”
GEN 45:25 They went up out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and came into the land of Canaan [Humbled], to Jacob [Supplanter] their father.
GEN 45:26 They told him, saying, “Joseph [May he add] is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].” His heart fainted, for he didn’t trust them.
GEN 45:27 They told him all the words of Joseph [May he add], which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph [May he add] had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob [Supplanter], their father, revived. (5)
GEN 45:28 Israel [God prevails] said, “It is enough. Joseph [May he add] my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN 46:1 Israel [God prevails] traveled with all that he had, and came to Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath], and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac [Laughter].
GEN 46:2 God spoke to Israel [God prevails] in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob [Supplanter], Jacob [Supplanter]!” He said, “Here I am.”
GEN 46:3 He said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go down into Egypt [Abode of slavery], for there I will make of you a great nation.
GEN 46:4 I will go down with you into Egypt [Abode of slavery]. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph [May he add] will close your eyes.”
GEN 46:5 Jacob [Supplanter] rose up from Be'er-Sheva [Well of Seven, Well of an Oath], and the sons of Israel [God prevails] carried Jacob [Supplanter], their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
GEN 46:6 They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan [Humbled], and came into Egypt [Abode of slavery]— Jacob, and all his offspring with him,
GEN 46:7 his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and he brought all his offspring with him into Egypt [Abode of slavery].
GEN 46:8 These are the names of the children of Israel [God prevails], who came into Egypt [Abode of slavery], Jacob [Supplanter] and his sons: Reuben [See, a son!], Jacob [Supplanter]’s firstborn.
GEN 46:9 The sons of Reuben [See, a son!]: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
GEN 46:10 The sons of Simeon [Hearing]: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul [Asked for] the son of a Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled] woman.
GEN 46:11 The sons of Levi [United with]: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
GEN 46:12 The sons of Judah [Praised]: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan [Humbled]. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
GEN 46:13 The sons of Issachar [Hire, Reward]: Tola, Puvah, Job [Persecuted], and Shimron.
GEN 46:14 The sons of Zebulun [Living together]: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN 46:15 These are the sons of Leah [Weary], whom she bore to Jacob [Supplanter] in Paddan Aram [Elevated], with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.
GEN 46:16 The sons of Gad [Good fortune]: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
GEN 46:17 The sons of Asher [Happy]: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
GEN 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah [Frailty], whom Laban [White] gave to Leah [Weary], his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob [Supplanter], even sixteen souls.
GEN 46:19 The sons of Rachel [Ewe sheep], Jacob [Supplanter]’s wife: Joseph [May he add] and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south].
GEN 46:20 To Joseph [May he add] in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] were born Manasseh [Causing to forget] and Ephraim [Fruit], whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
GEN 46:21 The sons of Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south]: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
GEN 46:22 These are the sons of Rachel [Ewe sheep], who were born to Jacob [Supplanter]: all the souls were fourteen.
GEN 46:23 The son of Dan [He judged]: Hushim.
GEN 46:24 The sons of Naphtali [My wrestling]: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
GEN 46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah [Bashful], whom Laban [White] gave to Rachel [Ewe sheep], his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob [Supplanter]: all the souls were seven.
GEN 46:26 All the souls who came with Jacob [Supplanter] into Egypt [Abode of slavery], who were his direct offspring, besides Jacob [Supplanter]’s sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six.
GEN 46:27 The sons of Joseph [May he add], who were born to him in Egypt [Abode of slavery], were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob [Supplanter], who came into Egypt [Abode of slavery], were seventy. (6)
GEN 46:28 He sent Judah [Praised] before him to Joseph [May he add], to show the way before him to Goshen [Drawing near], and they came into the land of Goshen [Drawing near].
GEN 46:29 Joseph [May he add] prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel [God prevails], his father, in Goshen [Drawing near]. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
GEN 46:30 Israel [God prevails] said to Joseph [May he add], “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”
GEN 46:31 Joseph [May he add] said to his brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan [Humbled], have come to me.
GEN 46:32 These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’
GEN 46:33 It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, ‘What is your occupation?’
GEN 46:34 that you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen [Drawing near]; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].”
GEN 47:1 Then Joseph [May he add] went in and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan [Humbled]; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen [Drawing near].”
GEN 47:2 From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.
GEN 47:3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.”
GEN 47:4 They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan [Humbled]. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen [Drawing near].”
GEN 47:5 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph [May he add], saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
GEN 47:6 The land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen [Drawing near]. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock.”
GEN 47:7 Joseph [May he add] brought in Jacob [Supplanter], his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob [Supplanter] blessed Pharaoh.
GEN 47:8 Pharaoh said to Jacob [Supplanter], “How many are the days of the years of your life?”
GEN 47:9 Jacob [Supplanter] said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”
GEN 47:10 Jacob [Supplanter] blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. (7)
GEN 47:11 Joseph [May he add] placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had enjoined.
GEN 47:12 Joseph [May he add] nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.
GEN 47:13 There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] and the land of Canaan [Humbled] fainted by reason of the famine.
GEN 47:14 Joseph [May he add] gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and in the land of Canaan [Humbled], for the grain which they bought: and Joseph [May he add] brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
GEN 47:15 When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and in the land of Canaan [Humbled], all the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] came to Joseph [May he add], and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails.”
GEN 47:16 Joseph [May he add] said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone.”
GEN 47:17 They brought their livestock to Joseph [May he add], and Joseph [May he add] gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.
GEN 47:18 When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.
GEN 47:19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”
GEN 47:20 So Joseph [May he add] bought all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s.
GEN 47:21 As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt [Abode of slavery] even to the other end of it.
GEN 47:22 Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a chok ·portion· from Pharaoh, and ate their chok ·portion· which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land.
GEN 47:23 Then Joseph [May he add] said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
GEN 47:24 It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.” (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 47:25 They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find chen ·grace· in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
GEN 47:26 Joseph [May he add] made it a chok ·statute· concerning the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.
GEN 47:27 Israel [God prevails] lived in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], in the land of Goshen [Drawing near]; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
GEN 47:28 Jacob [Supplanter] lived in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] seventeen years. So the days of Jacob [Supplanter], the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.
GEN 47:29 The time came near that Israel [God prevails] must die, and he called his son Joseph [May he add], and said to him, “If now I have found chen ·grace· in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt [Abode of slavery],
GEN 47:30 but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and bury me in their burying place.” He said, “I will do as you have said.”
GEN 47:31 He said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Israel [God prevails] bowed at the head of his bed.
GEN 48:1 After these things, someone said to Joseph [May he add], “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh [Causing to forget] and Ephraim [Fruit].
GEN 48:2 Someone told Jacob [Supplanter], and said, “Behold, your son Joseph [May he add] comes to you,” and Israel [God prevails] strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.
GEN 48:3 Jacob [Supplanter] said to Joseph [May he add], “El Shaddai [God Almighty] appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan [Humbled], and blessed me,
GEN 48:4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’
GEN 48:5 Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] before I came to you into Egypt [Abode of slavery], are mine; Ephraim [Fruit] and Manasseh [Causing to forget], even as Reuben [See, a son!] and Simeon [Hearing], will be mine.
GEN 48:6 Your issue, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
GEN 48:7 As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel [Ewe sheep] died by me in the land of Canaan [Humbled] on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem [House of Bread]).”
GEN 48:8 Israel [God prevails] saw Joseph [May he add]’s sons, and said, “Whose are these?”
GEN 48:9 Joseph [May he add] said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.” (2)
GEN 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel [God prevails] were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
GEN 48:11 Israel [God prevails] said to Joseph [May he add], “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”
GEN 48:12 Joseph [May he add] brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
GEN 48:13 Joseph [May he add] took them both, Ephraim [Fruit] in his right hand toward Israel [God prevails]’s left hand, and Manasseh [Causing to forget] in his left hand toward Israel [God prevails]’s right hand, and brought them near to him.
GEN 48:14 Israel [God prevails] stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim [Fruit]’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh [Causing to forget]’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh [Causing to forget] was the firstborn.
GEN 48:15 He blessed Joseph [May he add], and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham [Father of a multitude] and Isaac [Laughter] walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,
GEN 48:16 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham [Father of a multitude] and Isaac [Laughter]. Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.” (3)
GEN 48:17 When Joseph [May he add] saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim [Fruit], it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim [Fruit]’s head to Manasseh [Causing to forget]’s head.
GEN 48:18 Joseph [May he add] said to his father, “Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”
GEN 48:19 His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”
GEN 48:20 He blessed them that day, saying, “In you will Israel [God prevails] bless, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim [Fruit] and as Manasseh [Causing to forget]’” He set Ephraim [Fruit] before Manasseh [Causing to forget].
GEN 48:21 Israel [God prevails] said to Joseph [May he add], “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
GEN 48:22 Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers] with my sword and with my bow.”
GEN 49:1 Jacob [Supplanter] called to his sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.
GEN 49:2 Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob [Supplanter]. Sh'ma ·Hear obey· unto Israel [God prevails], your father.
GEN 49:3 “Reuben [See, a son!], you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.
GEN 49:4 Boiling over like water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father’s bed, then defiled it. He went up to my couch.
GEN 49:5 “Simeon [Hearing] and Levi [United with] are brothers. Their swords are weapons of violence.
GEN 49:6 My soul, don’t come into their council. My glory, don’t be united to their assembly; for in their anger they killed men. In their self-will they hamstrung cattle.
GEN 49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob [Supplanter], and scatter them in Israel [God prevails].
GEN 49:8 “Judah [Praised], your brothers will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you. Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies. Your father’s sons will bow down before you.
GEN 49:9 Judah [Praised] is a lion’s cub. From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down, he crouched as a lion, as a lioness. Who will rouse him up?
GEN 49:10 The scepter will not depart from Judah [Praised], nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh [Him to whom obedience belongs]. To him will the obedience of the peoples be.
GEN 49:11 Binding his foal to the vine, his donkey’s colt to the choice vine; he has washed his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.
GEN 49:12 His eyes will be red with wine, his teeth white with milk.
GEN 49:13 “Zebulun [Living together] will dwell at the haven of the sea. He will be for a haven of ships. His border will be on Sidon.
GEN 49:14 “Issachar [Hire, Reward] is a strong donkey, lying down between the saddlebags.
GEN 49:15 He saw a resting place, that it was good, the land, that it was pleasant. He bows his shoulder to the burden, and becomes a servant doing forced labor.
GEN 49:16 “Dan [He judged] will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel [God prevails].
GEN 49:17 Dan [He judged] will be a serpent on the trail, an adder in the path, That bites the horse’s heels, so that his rider falls backward.
GEN 49:18 I have waited for your yishu'ah ·salvation·, Adonai. (5)
GEN 49:19 “A troop will press on Gad [Good fortune], but he will press on their heel.
GEN 49:20 “Asher [Happy]’s food will be rich. He will produce royal dainties.
GEN 49:21 “Naphtali [My wrestling] is a doe set free, who bears beautiful fawns.
GEN 49:22 “Joseph [May he add] is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a spring. His branches run over the wall.
GEN 49:23 The archers have severely grieved him, shot at him, and persecute him:
GEN 49:24 But his bow remained strong. The arms of his hands were made strong, by the hands of the 'Avir Ya'akov [Mighty One of Supplanter], (from there is the Ro'i [Shepherd Provider], the 'Even Isra'el [Stone of God prevails]),
GEN 49:25 even by the God of your father, who will help you; by Shaddai [Almighty], who will bless you, with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breasts, and of the rachamim ·womb of compassionate loves·.
GEN 49:26 The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors, above the boundaries of the ancient hills. They will be on the head of Joseph [May he add], on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers. (6)
GEN 49:27 “Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south] is a ravenous wolf. In the morning he will devour the prey. At evening he will divide the plunder.”
GEN 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel [God prevails], and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his blessing.
GEN 49:29 He enjoined them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron [Fawn-like] the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear],
GEN 49:30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah [Double], which is before Mamre [Bitter, Fatness], in the land of Canaan [Humbled], which Abraham [Father of a multitude] bought with the field from Ephron [Fawn-like] the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear] as a burial place.
GEN 49:31 There they buried Abraham [Father of a multitude] and Sarah [Princess], his wife. There they buried Isaac [Laughter] and Rebekah [Securely bound], his wife, and there I buried Leah [Weary]:
GEN 49:32 the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth [Trembling fear].”
GEN 49:33 When Jacob [Supplanter] finished enjoining words to his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people.
GEN 50:1 Joseph [May he add] fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him.
GEN 50:2 Joseph [May he add] enjoined his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel [God prevails].
GEN 50:3 Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] wept for him for seventy days.
GEN 50:4 When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph [May he add] spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found chen ·grace· in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
GEN 50:5 ‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan [Humbled].” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’”
GEN 50:6 Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”
GEN 50:7 Joseph [May he add] went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery],
GEN 50:8 All the house of Joseph [May he add], his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen [Drawing near].
GEN 50:9 There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
GEN 50:10 They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan [Descender], and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.
GEN 50:11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled], saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].” Therefore its name was called Abel [Vanity, Mourning] Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan [Descender].
GEN 50:12 His sons did to him just as he enjoined them,
GEN 50:13 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan [Humbled], and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah [Double], which Abraham [Father of a multitude] bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron [Fawn-like] the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], before Mamre [Bitter, Fatness].
GEN 50:14 Joseph [May he add] returned into Egypt [Abode of slavery]— he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
GEN 50:15 When Joseph [May he add]’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph [May he add] will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.”
GEN 50:16 They sent a message to Joseph [May he add], saying, “Your father enjoined before he died, saying,
GEN 50:17 ‘You shall tell Joseph [May he add], “Now please forgive the rebellious breach of relationship of your brothers, and their habitual sin ·missing the mark·, because they did evil to you.”’ Now, please forgive the rebellious breach of relationship of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph [May he add] wept when they spoke to him.
GEN 50:18 His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.”
GEN 50:19 Joseph [May he add] said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God?
GEN 50:20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is today, to save many people alive. (7)
GEN 50:21 Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
GEN 50:22 Joseph [May he add] lived in Egypt [Abode of slavery], he, and his father’s house. Joseph [May he add] lived one hundred ten years. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
GEN 50:23 Joseph [May he add] saw Ephraim [Fruit]’s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh [Causing to forget], were born on Joseph [May he add]’s knees.
GEN 50:24 Joseph [May he add] said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter].”
GEN 50:25 Joseph [May he add] took an oath of the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”
GEN 50:26 So Joseph [May he add] died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 1:1 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel [God prevails], who came into Egypt [Abode of slavery] (every man and his household came with Jacob [Supplanter]):
EXO 1:2 Reuben [See, a son!], Simeon [Hearing], Levi [United with], and Judah [Praised],
EXO 1:3 Issachar [Hire, Reward], Zebulun [Living together], and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south],
EXO 1:4 Dan [He judged] and Naphtali [My wrestling], Gad [Good fortune] and Asher [Happy].
EXO 1:5 All the souls who came out of Jacob [Supplanter]’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph [May he add] was in Egypt [Abode of slavery] already.
EXO 1:6 Joseph [May he add] died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.
EXO 1:7 The children of Israel [God prevails] were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
EXO 1:8 Now there arose a new king over Egypt [Abode of slavery], who didn’t know Joseph [May he add].
EXO 1:9 He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the children of Israel [God prevails] are more and mightier than we.
EXO 1:10 Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land.”
EXO 1:11 Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.
EXO 1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel [God prevails].
EXO 1:13 The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] ruthlessly made the children of Israel [God prevails] serve,
EXO 1:14 and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.
EXO 1:15 The king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] spoke to the Hebrew [Immigrant] midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,
EXO 1:16 and he said, “When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew [Immigrant] women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.”
EXO 1:17 But the midwives feared God, and didn’t do what the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] ordered them, but saved the baby boys alive. (2)
EXO 1:18 The king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?”
EXO 1:19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew [Immigrant] women are not like the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery] women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”
EXO 1:20 God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.
EXO 1:21 Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
EXO 1:22 Pharaoh enjoined all his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”
EXO 2:1 A man of the house of Levi [United with] went and took a daughter of Levi [United with] as his wife.
EXO 2:2 The woman conceived, and bore a son, upon seeing what a fine child he was, she hid him three months.
EXO 2:3 When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank.
EXO 2:4 His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.
EXO 2:5 Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her servant to get it.
EXO 2:6 She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ [Immigrants’] children.”
EXO 2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”
EXO 2:8 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” The maiden went and called the child’s mother.
EXO 2:9 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” The woman took the child, and nursed it.
EXO 2:10 The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses [Drawn out], and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.” (3)
EXO 2:11 In those days, when Moses [Drawn out] had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery] striking a Hebrew [Immigrant], one of his brothers.
EXO 2:12 He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], and hid him in the sand.
EXO 2:13 He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews [Immigrants] were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?”
EXO 2:14 He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery]?” Moses [Drawn out] was afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.”
EXO 2:15 Now when Pharaoh sh'ma ·heard obeyed· this thing, he sought to kill Moses [Drawn out]. But Moses [Drawn out] fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian [Strife], and he sat down by a well.
EXO 2:16 Now the priest of Midian [Strife] had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
EXO 2:17 The shepherds came and divorced them away; but Moses [Drawn out] stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
EXO 2:18 When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so early today?”
EXO 2:19 They said, “An Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery] delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.”
EXO 2:20 He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.”
EXO 2:21 Moses [Drawn out] was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses [Drawn out] Zipporah, his daughter.
EXO 2:22 She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.”
EXO 2:23 In the course of those many days, the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] died, and the children of Israel [God prevails] sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.
EXO 2:24 God sh'ma ·heard obeyed· their groaning, and God remembered his covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with Abraham [Father of a multitude], with Isaac [Laughter], and with Jacob [Supplanter].
EXO 2:25 God saw the children of Israel [God prevails], and God was concerned about them.
EXO 3:1 Now Moses [Drawn out] was keeping the flock of Jethro [Abundance], his father-in-law, the priest of Midian [Strife], and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb [Desert].
EXO 3:2 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
EXO 3:3 Moses [Drawn out] said, “I will turn aside now and see this great sight; why the bush is not being burned up?”
EXO 3:4 When Adonai saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses [Drawn out]! Moses [Drawn out]!” He said, “Here I am.”
EXO 3:5 He said, “Don’t come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground.”
EXO 3:6 Moreover he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], the God of Isaac [Laughter], and the God of Jacob [Supplanter].” Moses [Drawn out] hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.
EXO 3:7 Adonai said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt [Abode of slavery], and have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
EXO 3:8 I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], the Perizzite [Descendant of Belonging to village], the Hivite [Wicked], and the Jebusite [Descendants of Thresher].
EXO 3:9 Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel [God prevails] has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] oppress them.
EXO 3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel [God prevails], out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
EXO 3:11 Moses [Drawn out] said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel [God prevails] out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]?”
EXO 3:12 He said, “Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], you shall abad ·serve· God on this mountain.”
EXO 3:13 Moses [Drawn out] said to God, “Behold, when I come to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you;’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ What should I tell them?”
EXO 3:14 God said to Moses [Drawn out], “I Am Who I Am ,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel [God prevails] this: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”
EXO 3:15 God said moreover to Moses [Drawn out], “You shall tell the children of Israel [God prevails] this, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], the God of Isaac [Laughter], and the God of Jacob [Supplanter], has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations. (5)
EXO 3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel [God prevails] together, and tell them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], of Isaac [Laughter], and of Jacob [Supplanter], has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt [Abode of slavery];
EXO 3:17 and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to the land of the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], the Perizzite [Descendant of Belonging to village], the Hivite [Wicked], and the Jebusite [Descendants of Thresher], to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’
EXO 3:18 They will sh'ma ·hear obey· your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel [God prevails], to the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and you shall tell him, ‘Adonai, the God of the Hebrews [Immigrants], has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Adonai, our God.’
EXO 3:19 I know that the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
EXO 3:20 I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt [Abode of slavery] with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go.
EXO 3:21 I will give this people chen ·grace· in the sight of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty handed.
EXO 3:22 But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].”
EXO 4:1 Moses [Drawn out] answered, “But, behold, they will not trust me, nor sh'ma ·hear obey· to my voice; for they will say, ‘Adonai has not appeared to you.’”
EXO 4:2 Adonai said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.”
EXO 4:3 He said, “Throw it on the ground.” He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses [Drawn out] ran away from it.
EXO 4:4 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail.” He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.
EXO 4:5 “That they may trust that Adonai, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], the God of Isaac [Laughter], and the God of Jacob [Supplanter], has appeared to you.”
EXO 4:6 Adonai said furthermore to him, “Now put your hand inside your cloak.” He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
EXO 4:7 He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak again.” He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.
EXO 4:8 “It will happen, if they will not trust you or sh'ma ·hear obey· the voice of the first sign, that they will trust the voice of the latter sign.
EXO 4:9 It will happen, if they will not trust even these two signs or sh'ma ·hear obey· your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.”
EXO 4:10 Moses [Drawn out] said to Adonai, “O Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.”
EXO 4:11 Adonai said to him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is not it I, Adonai?
EXO 4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.”
EXO 4:13 He said, “Oh, Lord, please send someone else.”
EXO 4:14 Adonai’s anger burned against Moses [Drawn out], and he said, “What about Aaron [Light-bringer], your brother, the Levite [Descendant of United with]? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he comes out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
EXO 4:15 You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.
EXO 4:16 He will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen, that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.
EXO 4:17 You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.” (6)
EXO 4:18 Moses [Drawn out] went and returned to Jethro [Abundance] his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt [Abode of slavery], and see whether they are still alive.” Jethro [Abundance] said to Moses [Drawn out], “Go in peace.”
EXO 4:19 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out] in Midian [Strife], “Go, return into Egypt [Abode of slavery]; for all the men who sought your life are dead.”
EXO 4:20 Moses [Drawn out] took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Moses [Drawn out] took God’s rod in his hand.
EXO 4:21 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “When you go back into Egypt [Abode of slavery], see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.
EXO 4:22 You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘Adonai says, Israel [God prevails] is my son, my firstborn,
EXO 4:23 and I have said to you, “Let my son go, that he may abad ·serve· me;” and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.’”
EXO 4:24 On the way at a lodging place, Adonai met Moses [Drawn out] and wanted to kill him.
EXO 4:25 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”
EXO 4:26 So he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
EXO 4:27 Adonai said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses [Drawn out].” He went, and met him on God’s mountain, and kissed him.
EXO 4:28 Moses [Drawn out] told Aaron [Light-bringer] all Adonai’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had enjoined him.
EXO 4:29 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel [God prevails].
EXO 4:30 Aaron [Light-bringer] spoke all the words which Adonai had spoken to Moses [Drawn out], and did the signs in the sight of the people.
EXO 4:31 The people trusted, and when they sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that Adonai had visited the children of Israel [God prevails], and that he had seen their affliction, then they hawa ·bowed low, prostrated· their heads and worshiped.
EXO 5:1 Afterward Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] came, and said to Pharaoh, “This is what Yahweh, Elohim Isra'el [He sustains breathing, God of God prevails], says, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.’”
EXO 5:2 Pharaoh said, “Who is Adonai, that I should sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice to let Israel [God prevails] go? I don’t know Adonai, and moreover I will not let Israel [God prevails] go.”
EXO 5:3 They said, “The God of the Hebrews [Immigrants] has met with us. Please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Adonai, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.”
EXO 5:4 The king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] said to them, “Why do you, Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!”
EXO 5:5 Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.”
EXO 5:6 The same day Pharaoh enjoined the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
EXO 5:7 “You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
EXO 5:8 The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
EXO 5:9 Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don’t let them pay any attention to lying words.”
EXO 5:10 The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you straw.
EXO 5:11 Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’”
EXO 5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to gather stubble for straw.
EXO 5:13 The taskmasters were urgent saying, “Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!”
EXO 5:14 The officers of the children of Israel [God prevails], whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your chok ·statute· quote both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?”
EXO 5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel [God prevails] came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?
EXO 5:16 No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but the sin ·err (from the standard goal)· is in your own people.”
EXO 5:17 But he said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to Adonai.’
EXO 5:18 Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!”
EXO 5:19 The officers of the children of Israel [God prevails] saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, “You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!”
EXO 5:20 They met Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], who stood in the way, as they came out from Pharaoh:
EXO 5:21 and they said to them, “May Adonai look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.” (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
EXO 5:22 Moses [Drawn out] teshuvah ·completely returned· to Adonai, and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?
EXO 5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; and you have not rescued your people at all.”
EXO 6:1 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall divorce them out of his land.”
EXO 6:2 God spoke to Moses [Drawn out], and said to him, “I am Adonai;
EXO 6:3 and I appeared to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter], as El Shaddai [God Almighty]; but by my name Adonai I was not known to them.
EXO 6:4 I have also established my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with them, to give them the land of Canaan [Humbled], the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.
EXO 6:5 Moreover I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the groaning of the children of Israel [God prevails], whom the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.
EXO 6:6 Therefore tell the children of Israel [God prevails], ‘I am Adonai, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:
EXO 6:7 and I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am Adonai your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].
EXO 6:8 I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter]; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am Adonai.’”
EXO 6:9 Moses [Drawn out] spoke so to the children of Israel [God prevails], but they didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· unto Moses [Drawn out] for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
EXO 6:10 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 6:11 “Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery], that he let the children of Israel [God prevails] go out of his land.”
EXO 6:12 Moses [Drawn out] spoke before Adonai, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel [God prevails] haven’t sh'ma ·heard obeyed· unto me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, who am of uncircumcised lips?”
EXO 6:13 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and to Aaron [Light-bringer], and gave them an enjoinment to the children of Israel [God prevails], and to Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to bring the children of Israel [God prevails] out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. (2)
EXO 6:14 These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben [See, a son!] the firstborn of Israel [God prevails]: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben [See, a son!].
EXO 6:15 The sons of Simeon [Hearing]: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul [Asked for] the son of a Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled] woman; these are the families of Simeon [Hearing].
EXO 6:16 These are the names of the sons of Levi [United with] according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi [United with] were one hundred thirty-seven years.
EXO 6:17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.
EXO 6:18 The sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years.
EXO 6:19 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites [Descendants of United with] according to their generations.
EXO 6:20 Amram took Jochebed his father’s sister to himself as wife; and she bore him Aaron [Light-bringer] and Moses [Drawn out]: and the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven years.
EXO 6:21 The sons of Izhar: Korach [Bald one, Frost], and Nepheg, and Zichri.
EXO 6:22 The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.
EXO 6:23 Aaron [Light-bringer] took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar [Help of God] and Ithamar.
EXO 6:24 The sons of Korach [Bald one, Frost]: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
EXO 6:25 Eleazar [Help of God] Aaron [Light-bringer]’s son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife; and she bore him Pinchas [Bronze skin]. These are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites [Descendants of United with] according to their families.
EXO 6:26 These are that Aaron [Light-bringer] and Moses [Drawn out], to whom Adonai said, “Bring out the children of Israel [God prevails] from the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] according to their armies.”
EXO 6:27 These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to bring out the children of Israel [God prevails] from Egypt [Abode of slavery]. These are that Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer].
EXO 6:28 On the day when Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], (3)
EXO 6:29 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying, “I am Adonai. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] all that I speak to you.”
EXO 6:30 Moses [Drawn out] said before Adonai, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh sh'ma ·hear obey· unto me?”
EXO 7:1 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron [Light-bringer] your brother shall be your prophet.
EXO 7:2 You shall speak all that I enjoin you; and Aaron [Light-bringer] your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel [God prevails] go out of his land.
EXO 7:3 I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 7:4 But Pharaoh will not sh'ma ·hear obey· you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt [Abode of slavery], and bring out my armies, my people the children of Israel [God prevails], out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] by great judgments.
EXO 7:5 The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] shall know that I am Adonai, when I stretch out my hand on Egypt [Abode of slavery], and bring out the children of Israel [God prevails] from among them.”
EXO 7:6 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] did so. As Adonai enjoined them, so they did.
EXO 7:7 Moses [Drawn out] was eighty years old, and Aaron [Light-bringer] eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh. (4)
EXO 7:8 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and to Aaron [Light-bringer], saying,
EXO 7:9 “When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Perform a miracle!’ then you shall tell Aaron [Light-bringer], ‘Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.’”
EXO 7:10 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Adonai had enjoined: and Aaron [Light-bringer] cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
EXO 7:11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt [Abode of slavery], did the same thing with their enchantments.
EXO 7:12 For they each cast down their rods, and they became serpents: but Aaron [Light-bringer]’s rod swallowed up their rods.
EXO 7:13 Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· them; as Adonai had spoken.
EXO 7:14 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn. He refuses to let the people go.
EXO 7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.
EXO 7:16 You shall tell him, ‘Adonai, the God of the Hebrews [Immigrants], has sent me to you, saying, “Let my people go, that they may abad ·serve· me in the wilderness:” and behold, until now you haven’t sh'ma ·heard obeyed·.
EXO 7:17 Adonai says, “In this you shall know that I am Adonai. Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
EXO 7:18 The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] shall loathe to drink water from the river.”’”
EXO 7:19 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Tell Aaron [Light-bringer], ‘Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt [Abode of slavery], over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], both in wood buckets and in stone jars.’”
EXO 7:20 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] did so, as Adonai enjoined; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
EXO 7:21 The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] couldn’t drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 7:22 The magicians of Egypt [Abode of slavery] did the same thing with their enchantments; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· them; as Adonai had spoken.
EXO 7:23 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he didn’t even take this to heart.
EXO 7:24 All the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn’t drink the river water.
EXO 7:25 Seven days were fulfilled, after Adonai had struck the river.
EXO 8:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, “This is what Adonai says, ‘Let my people go, that they may abad ·serve· me.
EXO 8:2 If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs:
EXO 8:3 and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:
EXO 8:4 and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.’”
EXO 8:5 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Tell Aaron [Light-bringer], ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].’”
EXO 8:6 Aaron [Light-bringer] stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 8:7 The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], and said, “Entreat Adonai, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Adonai.”
EXO 8:9 Moses [Drawn out] said to Pharaoh, “I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only.”
EXO 8:10 He said, “Tomorrow.” He said, “Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God]. (5)
EXO 8:11 The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.”
EXO 8:12 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] went out from Pharaoh, and Moses [Drawn out] cried to Adonai concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.
EXO 8:13 Adonai did according to the word of Moses [Drawn out], and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
EXO 8:14 They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
EXO 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· them, as Adonai had spoken.
EXO 8:16 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Tell Aaron [Light-bringer], ‘Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].’”
EXO 8:17 They did so; and Aaron [Light-bringer] stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 8:18 The magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn’t. There were lice on man, and on animal.
EXO 8:19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is God’s finger:” and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· them; as Adonai had spoken.
EXO 8:20 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes out to the water; and tell him, ‘This is what Adonai says, “Let my people go, that they may abad ·serve· me.
EXO 8:21 Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
EXO 8:22 I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen [Drawing near], in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am Adonai on the earth. (6)
EXO 8:23 I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.”’”
EXO 8:24 Adonai did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses: and in all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.
EXO 8:25 Pharaoh called for Moses [Drawn out] and for Aaron [Light-bringer], and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!”
EXO 8:26 Moses [Drawn out] said, “It is not appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] to Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God]. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] before their eyes, and won’t they stone us?
EXO 8:27 We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God], as he has ordered us to do.”
EXO 8:28 Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Adonai your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me.”
EXO 8:29 Moses [Drawn out] said, “Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to Adonai that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only don’t let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Adonai.”
EXO 8:30 Moses [Drawn out] went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Adonai.
EXO 8:31 Adonai did according to the word of Moses [Drawn out], and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. There remained not one.
EXO 8:32 Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn’t let the people go.
EXO 9:1 Then Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Adonai, the God of the Hebrews [Immigrants], says: “Let my people go, that they may abad ·serve· me.
EXO 9:2 For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,
EXO 9:3 behold, Adonai’s hand is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.
EXO 9:4 Adonai will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel [God prevails] and the livestock of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel [God prevails].”’”
EXO 9:5 Adonai appointed a set time, saying, “Tomorrow Adonai shall do this thing in the land.”
EXO 9:6 Adonai did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt [Abode of slavery] died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel [God prevails], not one died.
EXO 9:7 Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn’t let the people go.
EXO 9:8 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out] and to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses [Drawn out] sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
EXO 9:9 It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and shall be a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
EXO 9:10 They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses [Drawn out] sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking out with boils on man and on animal.
EXO 9:11 The magicians couldn’t stand before Moses [Drawn out] because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].
EXO 9:12 Adonai hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· them, as Adonai had spoken to Moses [Drawn out].
EXO 9:13 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Adonai, the God of the Hebrews [Immigrants], says: “Let my people go, that they may abad ·serve· me.
EXO 9:14 For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
EXO 9:15 For now I would have stretched out my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;
EXO 9:16 but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth; (7)
EXO 9:17 as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won’t let them go.
EXO 9:18 Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt [Abode of slavery] since the day it was founded even until now.
EXO 9:19 Now therefore order that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. Every man and animal that is found in the field, and is not brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.”’”
EXO 9:20 Those who feared Adonai’s word among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.
EXO 9:21 Whoever didn’t respect Adonai’s word left his servants and his livestock in the field.
EXO 9:22 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
EXO 9:23 Moses [Drawn out] stretched out his rod toward the heavens, and Adonai sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth. Adonai rained hail on the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 9:24 So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] since it became a nation.
EXO 9:25 The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.
EXO 9:26 Only in the land of Goshen [Drawing near], where the children of Israel [God prevails] were, there was no hail.
EXO 9:27 Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], and said to them, “I have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· this time. Adonai is upright, and I and my people are wicked.
EXO 9:28 Pray to Adonai; for there has been enough of mighty thunder and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”
EXO 9:29 Moses [Drawn out] said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to Adonai. The thunders shall cease, and there will not be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is Adonai’s.
EXO 9:30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you don’t yet fear Adonai God.”
EXO 9:31 The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
EXO 9:32 But the wheat and the spelt was not struck, for they had not grown up. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
EXO 9:33 Moses [Drawn out] went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to Adonai; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.
EXO 9:34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
EXO 9:35 The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn’t let the children of Israel [God prevails] go, just as Adonai had spoken through Moses [Drawn out].
EXO 10:1 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs among them,
EXO 10:2 and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son’s son, what things I have done to Egypt [Abode of slavery], and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am Adonai.”
EXO 10:3 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, “This is what Adonai, the God of the Hebrews [Immigrants], says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may abad ·serve· me.
EXO 10:4 Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,
EXO 10:5 and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won’t be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.
EXO 10:6 Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]; as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’” He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
EXO 10:7 Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may abad ·serve· Adonai, their God. Don’t you yet know that Egypt [Abode of slavery] is destroyed?”
EXO 10:8 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, abad ·serve· Adonai your God; but who are those who will go?”
EXO 10:9 Moses [Drawn out] said, “We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to Adonai.”
EXO 10:10 He said to them, “Adonai be with you if I will let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces.
EXO 10:11 Not so! Go now you who are men, and abad ·serve· Adonai; for that is what you desire!” They were divorced from Pharaoh’s presence. (2)
EXO 10:12 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.”
EXO 10:13 Moses [Drawn out] stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and Adonai brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
EXO 10:14 The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and rested in all the borders of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, nor will there ever be again.
EXO 10:15 For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] in haste, and he said, “I have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· against Adonai your God, and against you.
EXO 10:17 Now therefore please forgive my habitual sin ·missing the mark· again, and pray to Adonai your God, that he may also take away from me this death.”
EXO 10:18 He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Adonai.
EXO 10:19 Adonai turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea]. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 10:20 But Adonai hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he didn’t let the children of Israel [God prevails] go.
EXO 10:21 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], even darkness which may be felt.”
EXO 10:22 Moses [Drawn out] stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] for three days.
EXO 10:23 They didn’t see one another, and nobody rose from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel [God prevails] had light in their dwellings. (3)
EXO 10:24 Pharaoh called to Moses [Drawn out], and said, “Go, abad ·serve· Adonai. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you.”
EXO 10:25 Moses [Drawn out] said, “You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God].
EXO 10:26 Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God]; and we don’t know with what we must serve Adonai, until we come there.”
EXO 10:27 But Adonai hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let them go.
EXO 10:28 Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!”
EXO 10:29 Moses [Drawn out] said, “You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more.”
EXO 11:1 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt [Abode of slavery]; afterwards he will surely divorce you and let you go. When he casts you out, he will surely divorce you out altogether.
EXO 11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.”
EXO 11:3 Adonai gave the people chen ·grace· in the sight of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]. Moreover the man Moses [Drawn out] was very great in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people. (4)
EXO 11:4 Moses [Drawn out] said, “This is what Adonai says: ‘About midnight I will go out into the middle of Egypt [Abode of slavery],
EXO 11:5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock.
EXO 11:6 There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.
EXO 11:7 But against any of the children of Israel [God prevails] a dog won’t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that Adonai makes a distinction between the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] and Israel [God prevails].
EXO 11:8 All these servants of yours will come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, “Get out, with all the people who follow you;” and after that I will go out.’” He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
EXO 11:9 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Pharaoh won’t sh'ma ·hear obey· you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
EXO 11:10 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Adonai hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he didn’t let the children of Israel [God prevails] go out of his land.
EXO 12:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], saying,
EXO 12:2 “This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1· of the year to you.
EXO 12:3 Speak to all the congregation of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household;
EXO 12:4 and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
EXO 12:5 Your lamb shall be without defect, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
EXO 12:6 and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel [God prevails] shall kill it at evening.
EXO 12:7 They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two door posts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.
EXO 12:8 They shall eat the meat in that night, roasted with fire, and matzah ·unleavened bread·. They shall eat it with bitter herbs.
EXO 12:9 Don’t eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts.
EXO 12:10 You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.
EXO 12:11 This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is Adonai’s Pesac ·Passover·.
EXO 12:12 For I will go through the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], both man and animal. Against all the deities of Egypt [Abode of slavery] I will execute judgments: I am Adonai.
EXO 12:13 The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 12:14 This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to Adonai: throughout all your generations you shall keep it a feast by this regulation forever.
EXO 12:15 “‘Seven days you shall eat matzah ·unleavened bread·; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel [God prevails].
EXO 12:16 In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
EXO 12:17 You shall observe the festival of Matzah ·Unleavened bread·; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]: therefore you shall observe this day throughout all your generations by this regulation forever.
EXO 12:18 In the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat matzah ·unleavened bread·, until the twenty first day of the month at evening.
EXO 12:19 There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel [God prevails], whether he be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land.
EXO 12:20 You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat matzah ·unleavened bread·.’” (5)
EXO 12:21 Then Moses [Drawn out] called for all the elders of Israel [God prevails], and said to them, “Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Pesac ·Passover· lamb.
EXO 12:22 You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two door posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
EXO 12:23 For Adonai will pass through to strike the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door posts, Adonai will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.
EXO 12:24 You shall observe this thing for an statute to you and to your sons forever.
EXO 12:25 It shall happen when you have come to the land which Adonai will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.
EXO 12:26 It will happen, when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’
EXO 12:27 that you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of Adonai’s Pesac ·Passover·, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel [God prevails] in Egypt [Abode of slavery], when he struck the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and spared our houses.’” The people bowed their heads and worshiped.
EXO 12:28 The children of Israel [God prevails] went and did so; as Adonai had enjoined Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], so they did. (6)
EXO 12:29 At midnight, Adonai struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock.
EXO 12:30 Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]; and there was a great cry in Egypt [Abode of slavery], for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
EXO 12:31 He called for Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel [God prevails]; and go, abad ·serve· Adonai, as you have said!
EXO 12:32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!”
EXO 12:33 The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.”
EXO 12:34 The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
EXO 12:35 The children of Israel [God prevails] did according to the word of Moses [Drawn out]; and they asked of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.
EXO 12:36 Adonai gave the people chen ·grace· in the sight of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], so that they let them have what they asked. They plundered the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].
EXO 12:37 The children of Israel [God prevails] traveled from Rameses to Sukkot, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.
EXO 12:38 A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.
EXO 12:39 They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; for it was not leavened, because they were divorced out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and couldn’t wait, and they had not prepared any food for themselves.
EXO 12:40 Now the time that the children of Israel [God prevails] lived in Egypt [Abode of slavery] was four hundred thirty years.
EXO 12:41 At the end of four hundred thirty years, to the day, all of Adonai’s armies went out from the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 12:42 It is a night to be much observed to Adonai for bringing them out from the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. This is that night of Adonai, to be much observed of all the children of Israel [God prevails] throughout their generations.
EXO 12:43 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], “This is the regulation of the Pesac ·Passover· lamb. No foreigner shall eat of it,
EXO 12:44 but every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.
EXO 12:45 A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
EXO 12:46 It must be eaten In one house. You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the house. Do not break any of its bones.
EXO 12:47 All the congregation of Israel [God prevails] shall keep it.
EXO 12:48 When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Pesac ·Passover· to Adonai, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
EXO 12:49 One Torah ·Teaching· shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.”
EXO 12:50 All the children of Israel [God prevails] did so. As Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], so they did.
EXO 12:51 That same day, Adonai brought the children of Israel [God prevails] out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] by their armies.
EXO 13:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 13:2 “Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel [God prevails], both of man and of animal. It is mine.”
EXO 13:3 Moses [Drawn out] said to the people, “Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Adonai brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.
EXO 13:4 Today you go out in the first month Aviv ·Ripening grain (of a new crop), 1·.
EXO 13:5 It shall be, when Adonai shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], and the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], and the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], and the Hivite [Wicked], and the Jebusite [Descendants of Thresher], which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this aboda ·service· in this month.
EXO 13:6 Seven days you shall eat matzah ·unleavened bread·, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Adonai.”
EXO 13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you. No yeast shall be seen with you, within all your borders.
EXO 13:8 You shall tell your son in that day, saying, “It is because of that which Adonai did for me when I came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
EXO 13:9 It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that Adonai’s Torah ·Teaching· may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Adonai has brought you out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 13:10 You shall therefore keep this regulation in its season from year to year.
EXO 13:11 “It shall be, when Adonai shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,
EXO 13:12 that you shall set apart to Adonai all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal. The males shall be Adonai’s.
EXO 13:13 Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
EXO 13:14 It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that you shall tell him, ‘By strength of hand Adonai brought us out from Egypt [Abode of slavery], from the house of bondage.
EXO 13:15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Adonai killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to Adonai all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’
EXO 13:16 It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand Adonai brought us out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
EXO 13:17 When Pharaoh had let the people go, God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)], although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they teshuvah ·completely return· to Egypt [Abode of slavery];”
EXO 13:18 but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea]; and the children of Israel [God prevails] went up armed out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 13:19 Moses [Drawn out] took the bones of Joseph [May he add] with him, for he had made the children of Israel [God prevails] swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.”
EXO 13:20 They took their journey from Sukkot, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
EXO 13:21 Adonai went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:
EXO 13:22 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the people.
EXO 14:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 14:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.
EXO 14:3 Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel [God prevails], ‘They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.’
EXO 14:4 I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] shall know that I am Adonai.” They did so.
EXO 14:5 The king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] was told that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel [God prevails] go from serving us?”
EXO 14:6 He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him;
EXO 14:7 and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and captains over all them.
EXO 14:8 Adonai hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and he pursued the children of Israel [God prevails]; for the children of Israel [God prevails] went out with a high hand. (2)
EXO 14:9 The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] pursued them. All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
EXO 14:10 When Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel [God prevails] lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel [God prevails] cried out to Adonai.
EXO 14:11 They said to Moses [Drawn out], “Because there were no graves in Egypt [Abode of slavery], have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]?
EXO 14:12 Is not this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt [Abode of slavery], saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may abad ·serve· the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]?’ For it were better for us to abad ·serve· the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], than that we should die in the wilderness.”
EXO 14:13 Moses [Drawn out] said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand still, and see the yishu'ah ·salvation· of Adonai, which he will work for you today: for the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again.
EXO 14:14 Adonai will fight for you, and you shall be still.” (A:3)
EXO 14:15 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], that they go forward.
EXO 14:16 Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel [God prevails] shall go into the middle of the sea on dry ground.
EXO 14:17 Behold, I myself will harden the hearts of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and they shall go in after them: and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.
EXO 14:18 The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] shall know that I am Adonai, when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.”
EXO 14:19 Ha mal'ak Elohim [The Angel of God], who went before the camp of Israel [God prevails], moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.
EXO 14:20 It came between the camp of Egypt [Abode of slavery] and the camp of Israel [God prevails]; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and one didn’t come near the other all night.
EXO 14:21 Moses [Drawn out] stretched out his hand over the sea, and Adonai caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
EXO 14:22 The children of Israel [God prevails] went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
EXO 14:23 The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
EXO 14:24 In the morning watch, Adonai looked out on the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery] army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery] army.
EXO 14:25 He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel [God prevails], for Adonai fights for them against the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]!” (A:4, S:3)
EXO 14:26 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], on their chariots, and on their horsemen.”
EXO 14:27 Moses [Drawn out] stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea teshuvah ·completely returned· to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] fled against it. Adonai overthrew the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] in the middle of the sea.
EXO 14:28 The waters teshuvah ·completely returned·, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.
EXO 14:29 But the children of Israel [God prevails] walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
EXO 14:30 Thus Adonai saved Israel [God prevails] that day out of the hand of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]; and Israel [God prevails] saw the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] dead on the seashore.
EXO 14:31 Israel [God prevails] saw the great work which Adonai did to the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and the people feared Adonai; and they trusted in Adonai, and in his servant Moses [Drawn out].
EXO 15:1 Then Moses [Drawn out] and the children of Israel [God prevails] sang this song to Adonai, and said, “I will sing to Adonai, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
EXO 15:2 Yah is my strength and song. He has become my yishu'ah ·salvation·. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
EXO 15:3 Adonai is a man of war. Yahweh [He sustains breathing] is his name.
EXO 15:4 He has cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea].
EXO 15:5 The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.
EXO 15:6 Your right hand, Adonai, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Adonai, dashes the enemy in pieces.
EXO 15:7 In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.
EXO 15:8 With the blast of your nostrils, the waters piled up! The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO 15:9 The enemy said, ‘I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.’
EXO 15:10 You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
EXO 15:11 Who is like you, Adonai, among the deities? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in tehilah ·praise song·, doing wonders?
EXO 15:12 You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.
EXO 15:13 “You, in your chesed ·loving-kindness·, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.
EXO 15:14 The peoples have sh'ma ·heard obeyed·. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO 15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom [Red] were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab [From father]. All the inhabitants of Canaan [Humbled] have melted away.
EXO 15:16 Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone— until your people pass over, Adonai, until the people pass over who you have purchased.
EXO 15:17 You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place, Adonai, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established.
EXO 15:18 Adonai shall reign forever and ever.”
EXO 15:19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Adonai brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel [God prevails] walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.
EXO 15:20 Miriam [Rebellion] the prophetess, the sister of Aaron [Light-bringer], took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.
EXO 15:21 Miriam [Rebellion] answered them, “Sing to Adonai, for he has triumphed. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.”
EXO 15:22 Moses [Drawn out] led Israel [God prevails] onward from the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea], and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
EXO 15:23 When they came to Marah [Bitter], they couldn’t drink from the waters of Marah [Bitter], for they were bitter. Therefore its name was called Marah [Bitter].
EXO 15:24 The people murmured against Moses [Drawn out], saying, “What shall we drink?”
EXO 15:25 Then he cried to Adonai. Adonai showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and a judgement for them, and there he tested them;
EXO 15:26 and he said, “If you will sh'ma ·hear obey· sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his mitzvot ·instructions·, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery]; for I am I am Yahweh Rafa' [Yahweh your Physician, Yahweh your Healer].” (A:5, S:4)
EXO 15:27 They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
EXO 16:1 They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails] came to the wilderness of Cin [Clay], which is between Elim and Sinai [Thorn], on the fifteenth day of the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·) after their departing out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 16:2 The whole congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails] murmured against Moses [Drawn out] and against Aaron [Light-bringer] in the wilderness;
EXO 16:3 and the children of Israel [God prevails] said to them, “We wish that we had died by Adonai’s hand in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”
EXO 16:4 Then Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my Torah ·Teaching·, or not.
EXO 16:5 It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”
EXO 16:6 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] said to all the children of Israel [God prevails], “At evening, then you shall know that Adonai has brought you out from the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery];
EXO 16:7 and in the morning, then you shall see the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing·; because he sh'ma ·hears obeys· your murmurings against Adonai. Who are we, that you murmur against us?”
EXO 16:8 Moses [Drawn out] said, “Now Adonai shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Adonai sh'ma ·hears obeys· your murmurings which you murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Adonai.”
EXO 16:9 Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], ‘Come near before Adonai, for he has heard your murmurings.’”
EXO 16:10 As Aaron [Light-bringer] spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· appeared in the cloud. (A:6, S:5)
EXO 16:11 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 16:12 “I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the murmurings of the children of Israel [God prevails]. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am Adonai your God.’”
EXO 16:13 In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.
EXO 16:14 When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.
EXO 16:15 When the children of Israel [God prevails] saw it, they asked one another, “Man hu? ·What is it·?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses [Drawn out] answered them, “It is the bread which Adonai has given you to eat.”
EXO 16:16 This is the thing which Adonai has enjoined: “Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer ·sheath of grain· [2.6 qt; 1.2 L] a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his tent.”
EXO 16:17 The children of Israel [God prevails] did so, and gathered some more, some less.
EXO 16:18 When they measured it with an omer ·sheath of grain· [2.6 qt; 1.2 L], he who gathered much had nothing extra, and he who gathered little had nothing lacking. They gathered every man according to his eating.
EXO 16:19 Moses [Drawn out] said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.”
EXO 16:20 Notwithstanding they didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· Moses [Drawn out], but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses [Drawn out] was angry with them.
EXO 16:21 They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.
EXO 16:22 On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses [Drawn out].
EXO 16:23 He said to them, “This is that which Adonai has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath ·Intermission· to Adonai. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’”
EXO 16:24 They laid it up until the morning, as Moses [Drawn out] enjoined, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it.
EXO 16:25 Moses [Drawn out] said, “Eat that today, for today is a Shabath ·Intermission· to Adonai. Today you shall not find it in the field.
EXO 16:26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Shabath ·Intermission·. In it there shall be none.”
EXO 16:27 On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.
EXO 16:28 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “How long do you refuse to keep my mitzvot ·instructions· and my torot ·teachings·?
EXO 16:29 Behold, because Adonai has given you the Shabath ·Intermission·, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.” (S:6)
EXO 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO 16:31 The house of Israel [God prevails] called its name Manna ·What is it·, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.
EXO 16:32 Moses [Drawn out] said, “This is the thing which Adonai has enjoined, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout all your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].’”
EXO 16:33 Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna ·what is it· in it, and lay it up before Adonai, to be kept throughout all your generations.”
EXO 16:34 As Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out], so Aaron [Light-bringer] laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
EXO 16:35 The children of Israel [God prevails] ate the manna ·what is it· forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna ·what is it· until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan [Humbled].
EXO 16:36 Now an omer ·sheath of grain· [2.6 qt; 1.2 L] is one tenth of an ephah [0.63 bushels; 5.9 gal; 22 L].
EXO 17:1 All the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails] traveled from the wilderness of Cin [Clay], by their journeys, according to Adonai’s order, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.
EXO 17:2 Therefore the people quarreled with Moses [Drawn out], and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses [Drawn out] said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Adonai?”
EXO 17:3 The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses [Drawn out], and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”
EXO 17:4 Moses [Drawn out] cried to Adonai, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”
EXO 17:5 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel [God prevails] with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.
EXO 17:6 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb [Desert]. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses [Drawn out] did so in the sight of the elders of Israel [God prevails].
EXO 17:7 He called the name of the place Massah [Testing], and Meribah [Quarreling], because the children of Israel [God prevails] quarreled, and because they tested Adonai, saying, “Is Adonai among us, or not?”
EXO 17:8 Then Amalek [Man who licks up] came and fought with Israel [God prevails] in Rephidim.
EXO 17:9 Moses [Drawn out] said to Joshua [Yah Salvation], “Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek [Man who licks up]. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God’s rod in my hand.”
EXO 17:10 So Joshua [Yah Salvation] did as Moses [Drawn out] had told him, and fought with Amalek [Man who licks up]; and Moses [Drawn out], Aaron [Light-bringer], and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
EXO 17:11 When Moses [Drawn out] held up his hand, Israel [God prevails] prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek [Man who licks up] prevailed.
EXO 17:12 But Moses [Drawn out]’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron [Light-bringer] and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset.
EXO 17:13 Joshua [Yah Salvation] defeated Amalek [Man who licks up] and his people with the edge of the sword. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
EXO 17:14 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua [Yah Salvation]: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek [Man who licks up] from under the sky.”
EXO 17:15 Moses [Drawn out] built an altar, and called its name Adonai our Banner.
EXO 17:16 He said, “Yah has sworn: ‘Adonai will have war with Amalek [Man who licks up] from generation to generation.’”
EXO 18:1 Now Jethro [Abundance], the priest of Midian [Strife], Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law, sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of all that God had done for Moses [Drawn out], and for Israel [God prevails] his people, how that Adonai had brought Israel [God prevails] out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
EXO 18:2 Jethro [Abundance], Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses [Drawn out]’ wife, after he had sent her away,
EXO 18:3 and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses [Drawn out] said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land”.
EXO 18:4 The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, “My father’s God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword.”
EXO 18:5 Jethro [Abundance], Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses [Drawn out] into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God.
EXO 18:6 He said to Moses [Drawn out], “I, your father-in-law Jethro [Abundance], have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.”
EXO 18:7 Moses [Drawn out] went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.
EXO 18:8 Moses [Drawn out] told his father-in-law all that Adonai had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] for Israel [God prevails]’s sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Adonai delivered them.
EXO 18:9 Jethro [Abundance] rejoiced for all the goodness which Adonai had done to Israel [God prevails], in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].
EXO 18:10 Jethro [Abundance] said, “Blessed be Adonai, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery].
EXO 18:11 Now I know that Adonai is greater than all deities because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them.”
EXO 18:12 Jethro [Abundance], Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron [Light-bringer] came with all the elders of Israel [God prevails], to eat bread with Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law before God. (2)
EXO 18:13 On the next day, Moses [Drawn out] sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses [Drawn out] from the morning to the evening.
EXO 18:14 When Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?”
EXO 18:15 Moses [Drawn out] said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
EXO 18:16 When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his torot ·teachings·.”
EXO 18:17 Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good.
EXO 18:18 You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.
EXO 18:19 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.
EXO 18:20 You shall teach them the statutes and the torot ·teachings·, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.
EXO 18:21 Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
EXO 18:22 Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.
EXO 18:23 If you will do this thing, and God enjoins you to do so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.” (3)
EXO 18:24 So Moses [Drawn out] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
EXO 18:25 Moses [Drawn out] chose able men out of all Israel [God prevails], and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
EXO 18:26 They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses [Drawn out], but every small matter they judged themselves.
EXO 18:27 Moses [Drawn out] let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.
EXO 19:1 In the third month Sivan ·Walk / Vision, 3· after the children of Israel [God prevails] had gone out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai [Thorn].
EXO 19:2 When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai [Thorn], they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel [God prevails] encamped before the mountain.
EXO 19:3 Moses [Drawn out] went up to God, and Adonai called to him out of the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob [Supplanter], and tell the children of Israel [God prevails]:
EXO 19:4 ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself.
EXO 19:5 Now therefore, if you will indeed sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice, and sh'ma ·hear obey· keep my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, then you shall be my own segulah ·special treasure· from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;
EXO 19:6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel [God prevails].” (5)
EXO 19:7 Moses [Drawn out] came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Adonai enjoined him.
EXO 19:8 All the people answered together, and said, “All that Adonai has spoken we will do.” Moses [Drawn out] reported the words of the people to Adonai.
EXO 19:9 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may sh'ma ·hear obey· when I speak with you, and may also trust you forever.” Moses [Drawn out] told the words of the people to Adonai.
EXO 19:10 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,
EXO 19:11 and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Adonai will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai [Thorn].
EXO 19:12 You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.
EXO 19:13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.” (S:6)
EXO 19:14 Moses [Drawn out] went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
EXO 19:15 He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.”
EXO 19:16 On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud shofar ·ram horn·; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.
EXO 19:17 Moses [Drawn out] led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.
EXO 19:18 All of Mount Sinai [Thorn] smoked, because Adonai descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.
EXO 19:19 When the sound of the shofar ·ram horn· grew louder and louder, Moses [Drawn out] spoke, and God answered him by a voice. (A:6, S:7)
EXO 19:20 Adonai came down on Mount Sinai [Thorn], to the top of the mountain. Adonai called Moses [Drawn out] to the top of the mountain, and Moses [Drawn out] went up.
EXO 19:21 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Adonai to gaze, and many of them perish.
EXO 19:22 Let the priests also, who come near to Adonai, sanctify themselves, lest Adonai break out on them.”
EXO 19:23 Moses [Drawn out] said to Adonai, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai [Thorn], for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’”
EXO 19:24 Adonai said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron [Light-bringer] up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Adonai, lest he break out against them.”
EXO 19:25 So Moses [Drawn out] went down to the people, and told them.
EXO 20:1 God spoke all these words, saying,
EXO 20:2 “I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], out of the house of bondage.
EXO 20:3 “You shall have no other elohim ·deities, judges· before me.
EXO 20:4 “You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
EXO 20:5 you shall not hawa ·bow low, prostrate· yourself down to them, nor abad ·serve· them, for I, Yahweh [He sustains breathing] your God, am El Kana' [Jealous God], visiting the depravity (moral evil) of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,
EXO 20:6 and showing chesed ·loving-kindness· to thousands of those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· me and keep my mitzvot ·instructions·.
EXO 20:7 “You shall not use את the name of Yahweh your God worthlessly, for Adonai will not hold him guiltless את who takes את his name in vain.
EXO 20:8 “Remember the Shabath ·Intermission· day, to keep it holy.
EXO 20:9 You shall labor six days, and do all your work,
EXO 20:10 but the seventh day is a Shabath ·Intermission· to Adonai your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;
EXO 20:11 for in six days Adonai made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore Adonai blessed the Shabath ·Intermission· day, and made it holy.
EXO 20:12 “Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land which Adonai your God gives you.
EXO 20:13 “You shall not murder.
EXO 20:14 “You shall not commit adultery.
EXO 20:15 “You shall not steal.
EXO 20:16 “You shall not give false witness against your neighbor.
EXO 20:17 “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.” (A:7)
EXO 20:18 All the people perceived the thunder, the lightnings, the sound of the shofar ·ram horn·, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.
EXO 20:19 They said to Moses [Drawn out], “Speak with us yourself, and we will sh'ma ·hear obey·; but don’t let God speak with us, lest we die.”
EXO 20:20 Moses [Drawn out] said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won’t sin ·err (the standard goal)·.”
EXO 20:21 The people stayed at a distance, and Moses [Drawn out] came near to the thick darkness where God was. (A: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
EXO 20:22 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “This is what you shall tell the children of Israel [God prevails]: ‘You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
EXO 20:23 You shall most certainly not make alongside of me deities of silver, or deities of gold for yourselves. (S: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
EXO 20:24 You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you.
EXO 20:25 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.
EXO 20:26 You shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.’
EXO 21:1 “Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them.
EXO 21:2 “If you buy a Hebrew [Immigrant] servant, he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything.
EXO 21:3 If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him.
EXO 21:4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
EXO 21:5 But if the servant shall plainly say, ‘I 'ahav ·affectionately love· my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out free;’
EXO 21:6 then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.
EXO 21:7 “If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.
EXO 21:8 If she does not please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.
EXO 21:9 If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her in the mishpat ·manner· of a daughter.
EXO 21:10 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital rights.
EXO 21:11 If he does not do these three things for her, she may go free without paying any money.
EXO 21:12 “One who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death,
EXO 21:13 but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen: then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.
EXO 21:14 If a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor to kill him, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.
EXO 21:15 “Anyone who attacks his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.
EXO 21:16 “Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
EXO 21:17 “Anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
EXO 21:18 “If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he does not die, but is confined to bed;
EXO 21:19 if he rises again and walks around with his staff, then he who struck him shall be cleared: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed. (2)
EXO 21:20 “If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.
EXO 21:21 Notwithstanding, if he gets up after a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his property.
EXO 21:22 “If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows, he shall be surely fined as much as the woman’s husband demands and the judges allow.
EXO 21:23 But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life,
EXO 21:24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
EXO 21:25 burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.
EXO 21:26 “If a man strikes his servant’s eye, or his maid’s eye, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.
EXO 21:27 If he strikes out his male servant’s tooth, or his female servant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.
EXO 21:28 “If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull shall surely be stoned, and its meat shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible.
EXO 21:29 But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death.
EXO 21:30 If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid on him.
EXO 21:31 Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.
EXO 21:32 If the bull gores a male servant or a female servant, thirty shekels [12 oz; 3/4 lb; 340.2 g] of silver shall be given to their master, and the ox shall be stoned.
EXO 21:33 “If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it,
EXO 21:34 the owner of the pit shall make it good. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall be his.
EXO 21:35 “If one man’s bull injures another’s, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live bull, and divide its price; and they shall also divide the dead animal.
EXO 21:36 Or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall be his own.
EXO 22:1 “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it, or sells it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
EXO 22:2 If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him.
EXO 22:3 If the sun has risen on him, guilt of bloodshed shall be for him; he shall make restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
EXO 22:4 If the stolen property is found in his hand alive, whether it is ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall pay double. (3)
EXO 22:5 “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and lets his animal loose, and it grazes in another man’s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field, and from the best of his own vineyard.
EXO 22:6 “If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
EXO 22:7 “If a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief is found, he shall pay double.
EXO 22:8 If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall come near to God, to find out if he has not put his hand to his neighbor’s goods.
EXO 22:9 For every matter of rebellious breach of relationship, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing, about which one says, ‘This is mine,’ the cause of both parties shall come before God. He whom God condemns as guilty shall pay double to his neighbor.
EXO 22:10 “If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies or is injured, or driven away, no man seeing it;
EXO 22:11 the oath of Adonai shall be between them both, whether he has not put his hand to his neighbor’s goods; and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
EXO 22:12 But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner.
EXO 22:13 If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence. He shall not make good that which was torn.
EXO 22:14 “If a man borrows anything of his neighbor’s, and it is injured, or dies, its owner not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.
EXO 22:15 If its owner is with it, he shall not make it good. If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease.
EXO 22:16 “If a man entices a virgin who is not pledged to be married, and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.
EXO 22:17 If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
EXO 22:18 “You shall not allow a sorceress to live.

EXO 29:34 If anything of the meat of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
EXO 29:35 “You shall do so to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to his sons, according to all that I have enjoined you. You shall consecrate them seven days.

EXO 30:1 “You shall make an altar to burn incense on. You shall make it of acacia wood.

EXO 30:10 Aaron [Light-bringer] shall make atonement on its horns once in the year; with the blood of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering of atonement once in the year he shall make atonement for it throughout all your generations. It is most holy to Adonai.”
EXO 30:11 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 30:12 “When you take a census of the children of Israel [God prevails], according to those who are counted among them, then each man shall give a ransom for his soul to Adonai, when you count them; that there be no plague among them when you count them.
EXO 30:13 They shall give this, everyone who passes over to those who are counted, half a shekel [0.2 oz; 5.67 g] after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is 0.4 oz; 11.34 g; or called twenty gerahs 20/50 of an oz); half a shekel for an offering to Adonai.
EXO 30:14 Everyone who passes over to those who are counted, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering to Adonai.
EXO 30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel [0.2 oz; 5.67 g], when they give the offering of Adonai, to make atonement for your souls.
EXO 30:16 You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel [God prevails], and shall appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel [God prevails] before Adonai, to make atonement for your souls.”
EXO 30:17 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 30:18 “You shall also make a basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, in which to wash. You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.
EXO 30:19 Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.
EXO 30:20 When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Adonai.
EXO 30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die: and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their generations.”
EXO 30:22 Moreover Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 30:23 “Also take fine spices: of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels [12.5 lb; 5.67 kg]; and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty shekels [6.25 lb; 2.835 kg]; and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty shekels [6.25 lb; 2.835 kg];
EXO 30:24 and of cassia cinnamon five hundred shekels [12.5 lb; 5.67 kg], after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is 0.4 oz; 11.34 g); and a hin [0.98 gal; 3.7 L] of olive oil.
EXO 30:25 You shall make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.
EXO 30:26 You shall use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony,
EXO 30:27 the table and all its articles, the menorah ·lamp· and its accessories, the altar of incense,
EXO 30:28 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its base.
EXO 30:29 You shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.
EXO 30:30 You shall anoint Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest’s office.
EXO 30:31 You shall speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout all your generations.
EXO 30:32 It shall not be poured on man’s flesh, and do not make any like it, according to its composition. It is holy. It shall be holy to you.
EXO 30:33 Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.’”
EXO 30:34 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: there shall be an equal weight of each;
EXO 30:35 and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:
EXO 30:36 and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be to you most holy.
EXO 30:37 The incense which you shall make, according to its composition you shall not make for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for Adonai.
EXO 30:38 Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people.”
EXO 31:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 31:2 “Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah [Praised]:
EXO 31:3 and I have filled him with the breath mind Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,
EXO 31:4 to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,
EXO 31:5 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship.
EXO 31:6 Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan [He judged]; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have enjoined you:
EXO 31:7 the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,
EXO 31:8 the table and its utensils, the pure menorah ·lamp· with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
EXO 31:9 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the basin and its base,
EXO 31:10 the finely worked garments— the holy garments for Aaron [Light-bringer] the priest— the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office,
EXO 31:11 the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have enjoined you they shall do.”
EXO 31:12 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
EXO 31:13 “Speak also to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Shab'totay ·Intermissions·: for it is a sign between me and you throughout all your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh M’Kaddesh [Yahweh our Santifier / He sustains breathing who makes you holy].
EXO 31:14 You shall keep the Shabath ·Intermission· therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
EXO 31:15 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Shabath ·Intermission· of solemn rest, holy to Adonai. Whoever does any work on the Shabath ·Intermission· day shall surely be put to death.
EXO 31:16 Therefore the children of Israel [God prevails] shall keep the Shabath ·Intermission·, to observe the Shabath ·Intermission· throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·.
EXO 31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel [God prevails] forever; for in six days Adonai made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’” (2)
EXO 31:18 He gave to Moses [Drawn out], when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai [Thorn], the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with the finger of God.
EXO 32:1 When the people saw that Moses [Drawn out] delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron [Light-bringer], and said to him, “Come, make us deities, which shall lead us; for this Moses [Drawn out], the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], we don’t know what has become of him.”
EXO 32:2 Aaron [Light-bringer] said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.”
EXO 32:3 All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron [Light-bringer].
EXO 32:4 He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, “These are your deities, Israel [God prevails], which brought you up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
EXO 32:5 When Aaron [Light-bringer] saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron [Light-bringer] made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Adonai.”
EXO 32:6 They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to pray.
EXO 32:7 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], “Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], have corrupted themselves!
EXO 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I enjoined them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your deities, Israel [God prevails], which brought you up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].’”
EXO 32:9 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.
EXO 32:10 Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.”
EXO 32:11 Moses [Drawn out] begged Adonai his God, and said, “Adonai, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] with great power and with a mighty hand?
EXO 32:12 Why should the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] speak, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and teshuvah ·turn repent· of this evil against your people.
EXO 32:13 Remember Abraham [Father of a multitude], Isaac [Laughter], and Israel [God prevails], your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”
EXO 32:14 Adonai changed his mind concerning the disaster which he planned for his people.
EXO 32:15 Moses [Drawn out] turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.
EXO 32:16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.
EXO 32:17 When Joshua [Yah Salvation] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses [Drawn out], “There is the noise of war in the camp.”
EXO 32:18 He said, “It is not the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I sh'ma ·hear obey·.”
EXO 32:19 As soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses [Drawn out]’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.
EXO 32:20 He took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel [God prevails] drink of it.
EXO 32:21 Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great cause for sacrifice for sin ·missing the goal· on them?”
EXO 32:22 Aaron [Light-bringer] said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.
EXO 32:23 For they said to me, ‘Make us deities to lead us; for this Moses [Drawn out], the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], we don’t know what has become of him.’
EXO 32:24 I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:’ so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”
EXO 32:25 When Moses [Drawn out] saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron [Light-bringer] had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),
EXO 32:26 then Moses [Drawn out] stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on Adonai’s side, come to me!” All the sons of Levi [United with] gathered themselves together to him.
EXO 32:27 He said to them, “Adonai says, the God of Israel [God prevails], ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’”
EXO 32:28 The sons of Levi [United with] did according to the word of Moses [Drawn out]: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
EXO 32:29 Moses [Drawn out] said, “Consecrate yourselves today to Adonai, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may give you a blessing today.”
EXO 32:30 On the next day, Moses [Drawn out] said to the people, “You have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· a great cause for sacrifice for sin ·missing the goal·. Now I will go up to Adonai. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your habitual sin ·missing the mark·.”
EXO 32:31 Moses [Drawn out] teshuvah ·completely returned· to Adonai, and said, “Oh, this people have sinned a great cause for sacrifice for sin ·missing the goal·, and have made themselves deities of gold.
EXO 32:32 Yet now, if you will, forgive their habitual sin ·missing the mark·— and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written.”
EXO 32:33 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Whoever has sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· against me, him will I blot out of my book.
EXO 32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their habitual sin ·missing the mark·.”
EXO 32:35 Adonai struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron [Light-bringer] made.
EXO 33:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], “Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to the land of which I swore to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter], saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’
EXO 33:2 I will send an angel before you; and I will divorce the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], and the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], and the Perizzite [Descendant of Belonging to village], the Hivite [Wicked], and the Jebusite [Descendants of Thresher]:
EXO 33:3 to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.”
EXO 33:4 When the people sh'ma ·heard obeyed· this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry.
EXO 33:5 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Tell the children of Israel [God prevails], ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into the middle of you for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.’”
EXO 33:6 The children of Israel [God prevails] stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb [Desert] onward.
EXO 33:7 Now Moses [Drawn out] used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it “The Tent of Meeting.” Everyone who sought Adonai went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.
EXO 33:8 When Moses [Drawn out] went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses [Drawn out], until he had gone into the Tent.
EXO 33:9 When Moses [Drawn out] entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses [Drawn out].
EXO 33:10 All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.
EXO 33:11 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua [Yah Salvation], the son of Nun, a young man, didn’t depart from the Tent. (3)
EXO 33:12 Moses [Drawn out] said to Adonai, “Behold, you tell me, ‘Bring up this people:’ and you haven’t let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found chen ·grace· in my sight.’
EXO 33:13 Now therefore, if I have found chen ·grace· in your sight, please show me now your way, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.”
EXO 33:14 He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
EXO 33:15 He said to him, “If your presence does not go with me, don’t carry us up from here.
EXO 33:16 For how would people know that I have found chen ·grace· in your sight, I and your people? Is not it that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?” (4)
EXO 33:17 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found chen ·grace· in my sight, and I know you by name.”
EXO 33:18 He said, “Please show me your kavod ·weighty glory·.”
EXO 33:19 He said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim Adonai’s name before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show racham ·merciful love· on whom I will show racham ·mercy·.”

EXO 33:22 It will happen, while my kavod ·weighty glory· passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;
EXO 33:23 then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”

EXO 34:2 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai [Thorn], and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.

EXO 34:8 Moses [Drawn out] hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.
EXO 34:9 He said, “If now I have found chen ·grace· in your sight, Adonai, please let Adonai go among us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our depravity (moral evil) and our habitual sin ·missing the mark·, and take us for your inheritance.” (6)
EXO 34:10 He said, “Behold, I make a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of Adonai; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.

EXO 34:12 Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:
EXO 34:13 but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherah poles;
EXO 34:14 for you shall hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship no other deity: for Yahweh [He sustains breathing], whose name is Kana' [Jealous], is El Kana' [God Jealous].
EXO 34:15 “Don’t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their deities, and sacrifice to their deities, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;

EXO 39:22 He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
EXO 39:23 The opening of the robe in the middle of it was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening, that it should not be torn.
EXO 39:24 They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen.

EXO 40:17 In the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1· in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was raised up.
EXO 40:18 Moses [Drawn out] raised up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars.
EXO 40:19 He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle above on it, as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
EXO 40:20 He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.

EXO 40:33 He raised up the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses [Drawn out] finished the work. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
EXO 40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· filled the tabernacle.

EXO 40:37 but if the cloud was not taken up, then they didn’t travel until the day that it was taken up.
EXO 40:38 For the cloud of Adonai was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel [God prevails], throughout all their journeys.

LEV 6:3 or has found that which was lost, and dealt falsely therein, and swearing to a lie; in any of these things that a man does, sinning ·deviating (from the standard goal)· therein;
LEV 6:4 then it shall be, if he has sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·, and is condemned guilty, he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found, (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
LEV 6:5 or any thing about which he has sworn falsely; he shall restore it even in full, and shall add a fifth part more to it. To him to whom it belongs he shall give it, in the day of his trespass guilt.
LEV 6:6 He shall bring his fault incurring guilt offering to Adonai, a ram without defect from the flock, according to your estimation, for a fault incurring guilt offering, to the priest.
LEV 6:7 The priest shall make atonement for him before Adonai, and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he does to become trespass guilty.”
LEV 6:8 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 6:9 “Enjoin Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons, saying, ‘This is the Torah ·Teaching· of the burnt offering: the burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
LEV 6:10 The priest shall put on his linen garment, and he shall put on his linen breeches upon his body; and he shall remove the ashes from where the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
LEV 6:11 He shall take off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
LEV 6:12 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it, and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
LEV 6:13 Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
LEV 6:14 “‘This is the Torah ·Teaching· of the meal offering: the sons of Aaron [Light-bringer] shall offer it before Adonai, before the altar.
LEV 6:15 He shall take from there his handful of the fine flour of the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the meal offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma, as its memorial, to Adonai.
LEV 6:16 That which is left of it Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten without yeast in a holy place. They shall eat it in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
LEV 6:17 It shall not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and as the fault incurring guilt offering.
LEV 6:18 Every male among the children of Aaron [Light-bringer] shall eat of it, as their chok ·portion· forever throughout all your generations, from the offerings of Adonai made by fire. Whoever touches them shall be holy.’” (2)
LEV 6:19 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 6:20 “This is the offering of Aaron [Light-bringer] and of his sons, which they shall offer to Adonai in the day when he is anointed: one tenth of an ephah [an omer; 2.3 q; 2.2 L] of fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening.
LEV 6:21 It shall be made with oil in a griddle. When it is soaked, you shall bring it in. You shall offer the meal offering in baked pieces for a pleasant aroma to Adonai.
LEV 6:22 The anointed priest that will be in his place from among his sons shall offer it. By a statute forever, it shall be wholly burned to Adonai.
LEV 6:23 Every meal offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.”
LEV 6:24 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 6:25 “Speak to Aaron [Light-bringer] and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the Torah ·Teaching· of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering: in the place where the burnt offering is killed, the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering shall be killed before Adonai. It is most holy.
LEV 6:26 The priest who offers it for sin ·err (the standard goal)· shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
LEV 6:27 Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy. When there is any of its blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in a holy place.
LEV 6:28 But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.
LEV 6:29 Every male among the priests shall eat of it: it is most holy.
LEV 6:30 No habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be eaten: it shall be burned with fire.
LEV 7:1 “‘This is the Torah ·Teaching· of the fault incurring guilt offering. It is most holy.
LEV 7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering, he shall kill the fault incurring guilt offering; and its blood he shall sprinkle around on the altar.
LEV 7:3 He shall offer all of its fat: the fat tail, and the fat that covers the innards,
LEV 7:4 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away;
LEV 7:5 and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering made by fire to Adonai: it is a fault incurring guilt offering.
LEV 7:6 Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
LEV 7:7 “‘As is the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, so is the fault incurring guilt offering; there is one Torah ·Teaching· for them. The priest who makes atonement with them shall have it.
LEV 7:8 The priest who offers any man’s burnt offering, even the priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.
LEV 7:9 Every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest’s who offers it.
LEV 7:10 Every meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all the sons of Aaron [Light-bringer], one as well as another. (3)
LEV 7:11 “‘This is the Torah ·Teaching· of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which one shall offer to Adonai .
LEV 7:12 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mixed with oil.
LEV 7:13 With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving.
LEV 7:14 Of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave offering to Adonai. It shall be the priest’s who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.
LEV 7:15 The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
LEV 7:16 “‘But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or a free will offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice; and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten:
LEV 7:17 but what remains of the meat of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
LEV 7:18 If any of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, and it shall not be credited to him who offers it. It will be an abomination, and the soul who eats any of it will bear his depravity (moral evil).
LEV 7:19 “‘The meat that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. As for the meat, everyone who is clean may eat it;
LEV 7:20 but the soul who eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belongs to Adonai, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
LEV 7:21 When anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean animal, or any unclean abomination, and eats some of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to Adonai, that soul shall be cut off from his people.’”
LEV 7:22 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 7:23 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘You shall eat no fat, of bull, or sheep, or goat.
LEV 7:24 The fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of animals, may be used for any other service, but you shall in no way eat of it.
LEV 7:25 For whoever eats the fat of the animal, of which men offer an offering made by fire to Adonai, even the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people.
LEV 7:26 You shall not eat any blood, whether it is of bird or of animal, in any of your dwellings.
LEV 7:27 Whoever it is who eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.’”
LEV 7:28 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 7:29 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Adonai shall bring his offering to Adonai out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
LEV 7:30 With his own hands he shall bring the offerings of Adonai made by fire. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before Adonai.
LEV 7:31 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron [Light-bringer]’s and his sons’.
LEV 7:32 The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
LEV 7:33 He among the sons of Aaron [Light-bringer] who offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.
LEV 7:34 For the breast that is waved and the thigh that is raised I have taken from the children of Israel [God prevails] out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron [Light-bringer] the priest and to his sons as their chok ·portion· forever from the children of Israel [God prevails].’”
LEV 7:35 This is the anointing portion of Aaron [Light-bringer], and the anointing portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Adonai made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister to Adonai in the priest’s office;
LEV 7:36 which Adonai enjoined to be given them of the children of Israel [God prevails], in the day that he anointed them, by a regulation forever throughout all their generations.
LEV 7:37 This is the Torah ·Teaching· of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and of the fault incurring guilt offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings;
LEV 7:38 which Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out] in Mount Sinai [Thorn], in the day that he enjoined the children of Israel [God prevails] to offer their offerings to Adonai, in the wilderness of Sinai [Thorn].
LEV 8:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 8:2 “Take Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and the two rams, and the basket of matzah ·unleavened bread·;
LEV 8:3 and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.”
LEV 8:4 Moses [Drawn out] did as Adonai enjoined him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
LEV 8:5 Moses [Drawn out] said to the congregation, “This is the thing which Adonai has enjoined to be done.”
LEV 8:6 Moses [Drawn out] brought Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons, and washed them with water.
LEV 8:7 He put the coat on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod on him, and fastened it to him with it.
LEV 8:8 He placed the breastplate on him; and in the breastplate he put the 'Urim ·Lights· and the Thummim ·Perfections·.
LEV 8:9 He set the turban on his head; and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 8:10 Moses [Drawn out] took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.
LEV 8:11 He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to sanctify them.
LEV 8:12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron [Light-bringer]’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
LEV 8:13 Moses [Drawn out] brought Aaron [Light-bringer]’s sons, and clothed them with coats, and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them; as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out]. (5)
LEV 8:14 He brought the bull of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering.
LEV 8:15 He killed it; and Moses [Drawn out] took the blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger, and cleansed sin ·err (the standard goal)· from the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.
LEV 8:16 He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses [Drawn out] burned it on the altar.
LEV 8:17 But the bull, and its skin, and its meat, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp; as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 8:18 He presented the ram of the burnt offering: and Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
LEV 8:19 He killed it; and Moses [Drawn out] sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
LEV 8:20 He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses [Drawn out] burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
LEV 8:21 He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses [Drawn out] burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Adonai; as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out]. (6)
LEV 8:22 He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
LEV 8:23 He killed it; and Moses [Drawn out] took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron [Light-bringer]’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.
LEV 8:24 He brought Aaron [Light-bringer]’s sons; and Moses [Drawn out] put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses [Drawn out] sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
LEV 8:25 He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh;
LEV 8:26 and out of the basket of matzah ·unleavened bread·, that was before Adonai, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and on the right thigh.
LEV 8:27 He put all these in Aaron [Light-bringer]’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before Adonai.
LEV 8:28 Moses [Drawn out] took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a consecration for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Adonai.
LEV 8:29 Moses [Drawn out] took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before Adonai. It was Moses [Drawn out]’ portion of the ram of consecration, as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out]. (7)
LEV 8:30 Moses [Drawn out] took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron [Light-bringer], on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron [Light-bringer], his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.
LEV 8:31 Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer] and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I enjoined, saying, ‘Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons shall eat it.’
LEV 8:32 What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
LEV 8:33 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.
LEV 8:34 What has been done today, so Adonai has enjoined to do, to make atonement for you.
LEV 8:35 You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and thereby obeying what Adonai has ordered done, so that you may not die. For this is what I am enjoined.”
LEV 8:36 Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons did all the things which Adonai enjoined by Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 9:1 On the eighth day, Moses [Drawn out] called Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons, and the elders of Israel [God prevails];
LEV 9:2 and he said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Take a calf from the herd for a habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and offer them before Adonai.
LEV 9:3 You shall speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘Take a male goat for a habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering;
LEV 9:4 and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Adonai; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Adonai appears to you.’”
LEV 9:5 They brought what Moses [Drawn out] enjoined before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation came near and stood before Adonai.
LEV 9:6 Moses [Drawn out] said, “This is the thing which Adonai enjoined that you should do: and the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· shall appear to you.”
LEV 9:7 Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Draw near to the altar, and offer your habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as Adonai enjoined.”
LEV 9:8 So Aaron [Light-bringer] came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, which was for himself.
LEV 9:9 The sons of Aaron [Light-bringer] presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:
LEV 9:10 but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, he burned upon the altar; as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 9:11 The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
LEV 9:12 He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron [Light-bringer]’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
LEV 9:13 They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar.
LEV 9:14 He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV 9:15 He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin ·err (the standard goal)·, like the first.
LEV 9:16 He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the judgement. (2)
LEV 9:17 He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
LEV 9:18 He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron [Light-bringer]’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar,
LEV 9:19 and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver:
LEV 9:20 and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar:
LEV 9:21 and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron [Light-bringer] waved for a wave offering before Adonai, as Moses [Drawn out] enjoined.
LEV 9:22 Aaron [Light-bringer] lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
LEV 9:23 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· appeared to all the people. (3)
LEV 9:24 Fire came out from before Adonai, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
LEV 10:1 Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron [Light-bringer], each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange, foreign, adulterated fire before Adonai, which he had not enjoined them.
LEV 10:2 Fire came out from before Adonai, and devoured them, and they died before Adonai.
LEV 10:3 Then Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “This is what Adonai spoke of, saying, ‘I will show myself holy to those who come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” Aaron [Light-bringer] held his peace.
LEV 10:4 Moses [Drawn out] called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the dod ·uncle· of Aaron [Light-bringer], and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.”
LEV 10:5 So they came near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses [Drawn out] had said.
LEV 10:6 Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to Eleazar [Help of God] and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tear your clothes; so that you don’t die, and so that he not be angry with all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel [God prevails], bewail the burning which Adonai has kindled.
LEV 10:7 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Adonai is on you.” They did according to the word of Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 10:8 Then Adonai said to Aaron [Light-bringer],
LEV 10:9 “You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. This shall be a regulation forever throughout all your generations.
LEV 10:10 You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.
LEV 10:11 You are to teach the children of Israel [God prevails] all the statutes which Adonai has spoken to them by Moses [Drawn out].” (4)
LEV 10:12 Moses [Drawn out] spoke to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to Eleazar [Help of God] and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Adonai made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;
LEV 10:13 and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your chok ·portion·, and your sons’ chok ·portion·, of the offerings of Adonai made by fire: for so I am enjoined.
LEV 10:14 The breast that is waved and the thigh that is raised you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your chok ·portion·, and your sons’ chok ·portion·, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel [God prevails].
LEV 10:15 The thigh that is raised and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Adonai: and it shall be yours, and your sons’ with you, as a chok ·portion· forever; as Adonai has enjoined.” (5)
LEV 10:16 Moses [Drawn out] diligently inquired about the goat of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and, behold, it was burned: and he was angry with Eleazar [Help of God] and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron [Light-bringer] who were left, saying,
LEV 10:17 “Why haven’t you eaten the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it you to bear the depravity (moral evil) of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Adonai?
LEV 10:18 Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary: you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I enjoined.”
LEV 10:19 Aaron [Light-bringer] spoke to Moses [Drawn out], “Behold, today they have offered their habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering and their burnt offering before Adonai; and such things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering today, would it have been pleasing in Adonai’s sight?”
LEV 10:20 When Moses [Drawn out] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that, it was pleasing in his sight.
LEV 11:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and to Aaron [Light-bringer], saying to them,
LEV 11:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘These are the living things which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth.
LEV 11:3 Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and chews the cud among the animals, that you may eat.
LEV 11:4 “‘Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those who part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but does not have a parted hoof, he is unclean to you.
LEV 11:5 The cony, because he chews the cud but does not have a parted hoof, he is unclean to you.
LEV 11:6 The hare, because she chews the cud but does not part the hoof, she is unclean to you.
LEV 11:7 The pig, because he has a split hoof, and is cloven-footed, but does not chew the cud, he is unclean to you.
LEV 11:8 Of their meat you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you.
LEV 11:9 “‘These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that you may eat.
LEV 11:10 All that don’t have fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are detestable to you,
LEV 11:11 and you detest them. You shall not eat of their meat, and you shall detest their carcasses.
LEV 11:12 Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that is detestable to you.
LEV 11:13 “‘These you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are detestable: the eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture,
LEV 11:14 and the red kite, any kind of black kite,
LEV 11:15 any kind of raven,
LEV 11:16 the horned owl, the screech owl, and the gull, any kind of hawk,
LEV 11:17 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
LEV 11:18 the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,
LEV 11:19 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.
LEV 11:20 “‘All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
LEV 11:21 Yet you may eat these: of all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to hop on the earth.
LEV 11:22 Even of these you may eat: any kind of locust, any kind of katydid, any kind of cricket, and any kind of grasshopper.
LEV 11:23 But all winged creeping things which have four feet, are detestable to you.
LEV 11:24 “‘By these you will become unclean: whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV 11:25 Whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
LEV 11:26 “‘Every animal which parts the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, nor chews the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them shall be unclean.
LEV 11:27 Whatever goes on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours, they are unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV 11:28 He who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. They are unclean to you.
LEV 11:29 “‘These are they which are unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard,
LEV 11:30 the gecko, and the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink, and the chameleon.
LEV 11:31 These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV 11:32 On whatever any of them falls when they are dead, it shall be unclean; whether it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it will be clean. (7)
LEV 11:33 Every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, all that is in it shall be unclean, and you shall break it.
LEV 11:34 All food which may be eaten, that on which water comes, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
LEV 11:35 Everything where part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.
LEV 11:36 Nevertheless a spring or a cistern in which water is gathered shall be clean: but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean.
LEV 11:37 If part of their carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
LEV 11:38 But if water is put on the seed, and part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
LEV 11:39 “‘If any animal, of which you may eat, dies; he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.

LEV 13:43 Then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of tzara'at in the skin of the flesh,

LEV 16:14 He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
LEV 16:15 “Then he shall kill the goat of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat.
LEV 16:16 He shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel [God prevails], and because of their rebellious breaches of relationships, even all their habitual sins ·missing the marks·; and so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells with them in the middle of their uncleanness.
LEV 16:17 No one shall be in the Tent of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out, and has made atonement for himself and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel [God prevails]. (LY:2)
LEV 16:18 “He shall go out to the altar that is before Adonai and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the bull’s blood, and some of the goat’s blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar.
LEV 16:19 He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and make it holy from the uncleanness of the children of Israel [God prevails].
LEV 16:20 “When he has finished atoning for the Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat.
LEV 16:21 Aaron [Light-bringer] shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and yadah ·extend hands in confession· over him confessing all the depravities (moral evils) of the children of Israel [God prevails], and all their rebellious breaches of relationships, even all their habitual sins ·missing the marks·; and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness.
LEV 16:22 The goat shall carry all their depravities (moral evils) on himself to a solitary land, and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.
LEV 16:23 “Aaron [Light-bringer] shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave them there.
LEV 16:24 Then he shall bathe himself in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. (RY:2, LY:3)
LEV 16:25 The fat of the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering he shall burn on the altar.
LEV 16:26 “He who lets the goat go for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
LEV 16:27 The bull for the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and the goat for the habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp; and they shall burn their skins, their flesh, and their dung with fire.
LEV 16:28 He who burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
LEV 16:29 “It shall be a regulation to you forever: in the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]·, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no kind of work, the native-born, or the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you:
LEV 16:30 for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your habitual sins ·missing the marks· you shall be clean before Adonai.
LEV 16:31 It is a Shabath ·Intermission· of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict your souls. It is a regulation forever.
LEV 16:32 The priest, who is anointed and who is consecrated to be priest in his father’s place, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments.
LEV 16:33 Then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
LEV 16:34 “This shall be an everlasting regulation for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel [God prevails] once in the year because of all their habitual sins ·missing the marks·.” It was done as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 17:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 17:2 “Speak to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel [God prevails], and say to them: ‘This is the thing which Adonai has enjoined,
LEV 17:3 Whatever man there is of the house of Israel [God prevails], who kills a bull, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp,
LEV 17:4 and has not brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to offer it as an offering to Adonai before Adonai’s tabernacle: blood shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
LEV 17:5 This is to the end that the children of Israel [God prevails] may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, that they may bring them to Adonai, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace offerings to Adonai.
LEV 17:6 The priest shall sprinkle the blood on Adonai’s altar at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a pleasant aroma to Adonai.
LEV 17:7 They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols, after which they play the prostitute. This shall be a regulation forever to them throughout their generations.’ (RY:3, LY:5)
LEV 17:8 “You shall say to them, ‘Any man there is of the house of Israel [God prevails], or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
LEV 17:9 and does not bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to sacrifice it to Adonai; that man shall be cut off from his people.
LEV 17:10 “‘Any man of the house of Israel [God prevails], or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who eats any kind of blood, I will set my face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
LEV 17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life.
LEV 17:12 Therefore I have said to the children of Israel [God prevails], “No person among you may eat blood, nor may any stranger who lives as a foreigner among you eat blood.”
LEV 17:13 “‘Whatever man there is of the children of Israel [God prevails], or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.
LEV 17:14 For as to the life of all flesh, its blood is with its life: therefore I said to the children of Israel [God prevails], “You shall not eat the blood of any kind of flesh; for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.”
LEV 17:15 “‘Every person that eats what dies of itself, or that which is torn by animals, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening: then he shall be clean.
LEV 17:16 But if he does not wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his depravity (moral evil).’”
LEV 18:1 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out],
LEV 18:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and say to them, ‘I am Adonai your God.
LEV 18:3 You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], where you lived: and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan [Humbled], where I am bringing you. You shall not follow their regulations.
LEV 18:4 You shall do my judgments, and you shall keep my regulations, and walk in them: I am Adonai your God.

LEV 18:30 Therefore you shall keep my requirements, that you do not practice any of these abominable regulations and customs, which were practiced before you, and that you do not defile yourselves with them. I am Adonai your God.’”
LEV 19:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,

LEV 21:5 “‘They shall not shave their heads or shave off the corners of their beards or make any cuttings in their flesh.

LEV 21:16 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 21:17 “Say to Aaron [Light-bringer], ‘None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to offer the bread of his God.
LEV 21:18 For whatever man he is that has a defect, he shall not draw near: a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose, or any deformity,
LEV 21:19 or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand,
LEV 21:20 or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye, or an itching disease, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles.
LEV 21:21 No man of the offspring of Aaron [Light-bringer] the priest who has a defect shall come near to offer the offerings of Adonai made by fire. Since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.

LEV 21:24 So Moses [Drawn out] spoke to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel [God prevails].
LEV 22:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 22:2 “Tell Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel [God prevails], which they make holy to me, and that they not profane את my holy name. I am Adonai.
LEV 22:3 “Tell them, ‘If anyone of all your offspring throughout all your generations approaches the holy things, which the children of Israel [God prevails] make holy to Adonai, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me. I am Adonai.

LEV 22:6 the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his body in water.
LEV 22:7 When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
LEV 22:8 That which dies of itself, or is torn by animals, he shall not eat, defiling himself by it. I am Adonai.
LEV 22:9 “‘They shall therefore follow my requirements, lest they bear crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· for it, and die therein, if they profane it. I am Yahweh M'Kaddesham [Yahweh our Santifier / He sustains breathing who makes them holy].

LEV 22:11 But if a priest buys a slave, purchased by his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
LEV 22:12 If a priest’s daughter is married to an outsider, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.
LEV 22:13 But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, and has teshuvah ·completely returned· to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread: but no stranger shall eat any of it.
LEV 22:14 “‘If a man eats something holy unintentionally by mistake sin ·error·, then he shall add the fifth part of its value to it, and shall give the holy thing to the priest.
LEV 22:15 The priests shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel [God prevails], which they offer to Adonai,
LEV 22:16 and so cause them to bear the depravity (moral evil) that brings trespass guilt, when they eat their holy things; for I am Yahweh M'Kaddesham [Yahweh our Santifier / He sustains breathing who makes them holy].’” (3)
LEV 22:17 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 22:18 “Speak to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel [God prevails], and say to them, ‘Whoever is of the house of Israel [God prevails], or of the foreigners in Israel [God prevails], who offers his offering, whether it is any of their vows, or any of their free will offerings, which they offer to Adonai for a burnt offering;
LEV 22:19 that you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without defect, of the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats.
LEV 22:20 But whatever has a defect, that you shall not offer; for it shall not be acceptable for you.
LEV 22:21 Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to Adonai to accomplish a vow, or for a free will offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted. It shall have no defect.
LEV 22:22 Blind, injured, maimed, having a wart, festering, or having a running sore: you shall not offer these to Adonai, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Adonai.
LEV 22:23 Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his parts, that you may offer for a free will offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
LEV 22:24 You must not offer to Adonai that which has its testicles bruised, crushed, broken, or cut. You must not do this in your land.
LEV 22:25 You must not receive any of these from the hand of a foreigner to offer as bread for your God, because their deformity is a defect in them. They shall not be accepted for you.’”
LEV 22:26 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 22:27 “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born, then it shall remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the offering of an offering made by fire to Adonai.
LEV 22:28 Whether it is a cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
LEV 22:29 “When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Adonai, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
LEV 22:30 It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until the morning. I am Adonai.
LEV 22:31 “Therefore you shall keep my mitzvot ·instructions·, and do them. I am Adonai.
LEV 22:32 You shall not profane את my holy name, but I will be made holy among the children of Israel [God prevails]. I am Adonai who makes you holy,
LEV 22:33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to be your God. I am Adonai.”
LEV 23:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 23:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them, ‘The set feasts of Adonai, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
LEV 23:3 “‘Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Shabath ·Intermission· of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no kind of work. It is a Shabath ·Intermission· to Adonai in all your dwellings.
LEV 23:4 “‘These are the set feasts of Adonai, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.
LEV 23:5 In the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is Adonai’s Pesac ·Passover·.
LEV 23:6 On the fifteenth day of the same month is the festival of Matzah ·Unleavened bread· to Adonai. Seven days you shall eat matzah ·unleavened bread·.
LEV 23:7 In the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular aboda ·service·.
LEV 23:8 But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Adonai seven days. In the seventh day is a holy convocation: you shall do no regular aboda ·service·.’”
LEV 23:9 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 23:10 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:
LEV 23:11 and he shall wave the sheaf before Adonai, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Shabath ·Intermission· the priest shall wave it.
LEV 23:12 On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without defect a year old for a burnt offering to Adonai.
LEV 23:13 The meal offering with it shall be one tenth of an ephah [two omers; 4.6 q; 4.4 L] of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Adonai for a pleasant aroma; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin [2.6 qt; 1.2 L].
LEV 23:14 You must not eat bread, or roasted grain, or fresh grain, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. This is a regulation forever throughout all your generations in all your dwellings.
LEV 23:15 “‘You shall count from the next day after the Shabath ·Intermission·, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Shab'totay ·Intermissions· shall be completed:
LEV 23:16 even to the next day after the seventh Shabath ·Intermission· you shall count fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Adonai.
LEV 23:17 You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave offering made of one tenth of an ephah [two omers; 4.6 q; 4.4 L] of fine flour. They shall be baked with yeast, for first fruits to Adonai.

LEV 23:20 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before Adonai , with the two lambs. They shall be holy to Adonai for the priest.
LEV 23:21 You shall make proclamation on the same day: there shall be a holy convocation to you; you shall do no regular aboda ·service·. This is a regulation forever in all your dwellings throughout all your generations.
LEV 23:22 “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not wholly reap into the corners of your field, and you must not gather the gleanings of your harvest. You must leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner. I am Adonai your God.’” (5)
LEV 23:23 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 23:24 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘In the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]·, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you, a memorial of blowing of shofarot ·ram horns·, a holy convocation.
LEV 23:25 You shall do no regular aboda ·service·; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Adonai.’”
LEV 23:26 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 23:27 “However on the tenth day of this seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· is Yom-Kippur ·Day of Atonement·: it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Adonai.
LEV 23:28 You shall do no kind of work in that same day; for it is Yom-Kippur ·Day of Atonement·, to make atonement for you before Adonai your God.
LEV 23:29 For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day; shall be cut off from his people.
LEV 23:30 Whoever it is who does any kind of work in that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
LEV 23:31 You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout all your generations in all your dwellings.
LEV 23:32 It shall be a Shabath ·Intermission· of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Shabath ·Intermission·.” (6)
LEV 23:33 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 23:34 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· is the festival of Sukkot ·Booths· for seven days to Adonai.

LEV 23:36 Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Adonai. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Adonai. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular aboda ·service·.
LEV 23:37 “‘These are the appointed feasts of Adonai, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Adonai, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day;
LEV 23:38 besides the Shabath ·Intermission· of Adonai, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your free will offerings, which you give to Adonai.
LEV 23:39 “‘So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]·, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the festival of Adonai seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
LEV 23:40 You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Adonai your God seven days.
LEV 23:41 You shall keep it a feast to Adonai seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout all your generations. You shall keep it in the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]·.
LEV 23:42 You shall dwell in sukkot ·temporary tents· seven days. All who are native-born in Israel [God prevails] shall dwell in a sukkah ·temporary tent·,
LEV 23:43 that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel [God prevails] to dwell in sukkot ·temporary tents·, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. I am Adonai your God.’”
LEV 23:44 Moses [Drawn out] declared to the children of Israel [God prevails] the appointed feasts of Adonai.
LEV 24:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 24:2 “Enjoin the children of Israel [God prevails], that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a menorah ·lamp· to burn continually.
LEV 24:3 Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron [Light-bringer] keep it in order from evening to morning before Adonai continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout all your generations.
LEV 24:4 He shall keep in order the menorah ·lamp· candles on the pure gold menorah ·lamp· before Adonai continually.
LEV 24:5 “You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: one tenth of an ephah [two omers; 4.6 q; 4.4 L] shall be in one cake.
LEV 24:6 You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Adonai.
LEV 24:7 You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Adonai.
LEV 24:8 Every Shabath ·Intermission· day he shall set it in order before Adonai continually. It is on the behalf of the children of Israel [God prevails] an everlasting covenant.
LEV 24:9 It shall be for Aaron [Light-bringer] and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Adonai made by fire by a perpetual statute.”
LEV 24:10 The son of an Israelite [Descendant of God prevails] woman, whose father was an Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], went out among the children of Israel [God prevails]; and the son of the Israelite [Descendant of God prevails] woman and a man of Israel [God prevails] strove together in the camp.
LEV 24:11 The son of the Israelite [Descendant of God prevails] woman blasphemed HaShem [The Name], and cursed; and they brought him to Moses [Drawn out]. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan [He judged].
LEV 24:12 They put him in custody, until Adonai’s will should be declared to them.
LEV 24:13 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 24:14 “Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who sh'ma ·heard obeyed· him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
LEV 24:15 You shall speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal·.
LEV 24:16 He who blasphemes Adonai’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. The foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes HaShem [The Name], shall be put to death.
LEV 24:17 “‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
LEV 24:18 He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.
LEV 24:19 If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:
LEV 24:20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
LEV 24:21 He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.
LEV 24:22 You shall have one kind of judgment for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am Adonai your God.’”
LEV 24:23 Moses [Drawn out] spoke to the children of Israel [God prevails]; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel [God prevails] did as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 25:1 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out] in Mount Sinai [Thorn],
LEV 25:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep a Shabath ·Intermission· to Adonai.
LEV 25:3 You shall sow your field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six years, and gather in its fruits;
LEV 25:4 but in the seventh year there shall be a Shabath ·Intermission· of solemn rest for the land, a Shabath ·Intermission· to Adonai. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
LEV 25:5 What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
LEV 25:6 The Shabath ·Intermission· of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.
LEV 25:7 For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food.
LEV 25:8 “‘You shall count off seven Shab'totay ·Intermissions· of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven Shab'totay ·Intermissions· of years, even forty-nine years.
LEV 25:9 Then you shall sound the loud shofar ·ram horn· on the tenth day of the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]·. On Yom-Kippur ·Day of Atonement· you shall sound the shofar ·ram horn· throughout all your land.
LEV 25:10 You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee to you; and each of you shall teshuvah ·completely return· to his own property, and each of you shall teshuvah ·completely return· to his family.
LEV 25:11 That fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from the undressed vines.
LEV 25:12 For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.
LEV 25:13 “‘In this Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year· each of you shall teshuvah ·completely return· to his property. (LY:2)
LEV 25:14 “‘If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another.
LEV 25:15 According to the number of years after the Jubilee ·Shofar· you shall buy from your neighbor. According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you.
LEV 25:16 According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price; for he is selling the number of the crops to you.
LEV 25:17 You shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am Adonai your God.
LEV 25:18 “‘Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety. (RY:2, LY:3)
LEV 25:19 The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
LEV 25:20 If you said, “What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;”
LEV 25:21 then I will enjoin my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bear fruit for the three years.
LEV 25:22 You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.
LEV 25:23 “‘The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for you are strangers and live as foreigners with me.
LEV 25:24 In all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land. (LY:4)
LEV 25:25 “‘If your brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions, then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and redeem that which his brother has sold.
LEV 25:26 If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it;
LEV 25:27 then let him reckon the years since its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall teshuvah ·completely return· to his property.
LEV 25:28 But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·: and in the Jubilee ·Shofar· it shall be released, and he shall teshuvah ·completely return· to his property. (RY:3, LY:5)
LEV 25:29 “‘If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
LEV 25:30 If it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the Jubilee ·Shofar·.
LEV 25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be accounted for with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee ·Shofar·.
LEV 25:32 “‘Nevertheless the cities of the Levites [Descendants of United with], the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites [Descendants of United with] may redeem at any time.
LEV 25:33 The Levites [Descendants of United with] may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee ·Shofar·; for the houses of the cities of the Levites [Descendants of United with] are their possession among the children of Israel [God prevails].
LEV 25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
LEV 25:35 “‘If your brother has become poor, and his hand can’t support himself among you; then you shall uphold him. He shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident.
LEV 25:36 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God; that your brother may live among you.
LEV 25:37 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
LEV 25:38 I am Adonai your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to give you the land of Canaan [Humbled], and to be your God. (RY:4, LY:6)
LEV 25:39 “‘If your brother has grown poor among you, and sells himself to you; you shall not make him to serve as a slave.
LEV 25:40 As a hired servant, and as a temporary resident, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you until the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·:
LEV 25:41 then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall teshuvah ·completely return· to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers.
LEV 25:42 For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. They shall not be sold as slaves.
LEV 25:43 You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your God.
LEV 25:44 “‘As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have; of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves.
LEV 25:45 Moreover of the children of the aliens who live among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property.
LEV 25:46 You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever; but over your brothers the children of Israel [God prevails] you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness. (LY:7)
LEV 25:47 “‘If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger’s family;
LEV 25:48 after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;
LEV 25:49 or his dod ·uncle·, or his dod ·uncle’s· son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.
LEV 25:50 He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·. The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; he shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.
LEV 25:51 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
LEV 25:52 If there remain but a few years to the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.
LEV 25:53 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.
LEV 25:54 If he is not redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·, he, and his children with him. (LY: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
LEV 25:55 For to me the children of Israel [God prevails] are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. I am Adonai your God.
LEV 26:1 “‘You shall make for yourselves no idols, and you shall not raise up an engraved image or a pillar, and you shall not place any figured stone in your land, to hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to it; for I am Adonai your God.
LEV 26:2 “‘You shall keep my Shab'totay ·Intermissions·, and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am Adonai.
LEV 26:3 “‘If you walk in my statutes, and keep my mitzvot ·instructions·, and do them;

LEV 26:6 “‘I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid. I will remove evil animals out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
LEV 26:7 You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV 26:8 Five of you shall chase one hundred, and one hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV 26:9 “‘I will have respect for you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with you. (RY:5, LY:3)
LEV 26:10 You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new.
LEV 26:11 I will set my tent among you, and my soul won’t abhor you.
LEV 26:12 I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people.
LEV 26:13 I am Adonai your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], that you should not be their slaves. I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
LEV 26:14 “‘But if you will not sh'ma ·hear obey· me, and will not do all these mitzvot ·instructions·;

LEV 26:30 I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you.
LEV 26:31 I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.
LEV 26:32 I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein will be astonished at it.
LEV 26:33 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you. Your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
LEV 26:34 Then the land will enjoy its Shab'totay ·Intermissions· as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies’ land. Even then the land will rest and enjoy its Shab'totay ·Intermissions·.
LEV 26:35 As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn’t have in your Shab'totay ·Intermissions·, when you lived on it.
LEV 26:36 “‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword. They will fall when no one pursues.

LEV 26:38 You will perish among the nations. The land of your enemies will eat you up.
LEV 26:39 Those of you who are left will pine away in their depravity (moral evil) in your enemies’ lands; and also in the depravities (moral evils) of their fathers they shall pine away with them.

LEV 26:46 These are the statutes, judgments and torot ·teachings·, which Adonai made between him and the children of Israel [God prevails] in Mount Sinai [Thorn] by Moses [Drawn out].
LEV 27:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
LEV 27:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and say to them, ‘When a man consecrates a person to Adonai in a vow, according to your valuation,
LEV 27:3 your valuation of a male from twenty years old even to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels [1.25 lb; 0.57 kg] of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is 0.4 oz; 11.34 g).
LEV 27:4 If she is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels [12 oz; 3/4 lb; 340.2 g].
LEV 27:5 If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels [8 oz; 1/2 lb; 226.8 g], and for a female ten shekels [4 oz; 113.4 g].
LEV 27:6 If the person is from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels [2 oz; 56.7 g] of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
LEV 27:7 If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels [6 oz; 170.1 g], and for a female ten shekels [4 oz; 113.4 g].
LEV 27:8 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall assign a value to him. The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.
LEV 27:9 “‘If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to Adonai, all that any man gives of such to Adonai becomes holy.
LEV 27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
LEV 27:11 If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Adonai, then he shall set the animal before the priest;
LEV 27:12 and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be.
LEV 27:13 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.
LEV 27:14 “‘When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Adonai, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand.
LEV 27:15 If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his. (RY:7, LY:5)
LEV 27:16 “‘If a man dedicates to Adonai part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. The sowing of a homer [6.33 bushels; 59 gal; 220 L] of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels [1.25 lb; 0.57 kg] of silver.
LEV 27:17 If he dedicates his field from the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·, according to your valuation it shall stand.
LEV 27:18 But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee ·Shofar·, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation.
LEV 27:19 If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his.
LEV 27:20 If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;
LEV 27:21 but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee ·Shofar·, shall be holy to Adonai, as a devoted field. It shall be owned by the priests. (LY:6)
LEV 27:22 “‘If he dedicates a field to Adonai which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,
LEV 27:23 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year·; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to Adonai.
LEV 27:24 In the Jubilee Year ·Shofar Year· the field shall teshuvah ·completely return· to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.
LEV 27:25 All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: the shekel is 0.4 oz; 11.34 g; or called twenty gerahs [20/50 of an oz].
LEV 27:26 “‘Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to Adonai, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep. It is Adonai’s.
LEV 27:27 If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it; or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
LEV 27:28 “‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to Adonai of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Adonai. (LY:7)
LEV 27:29 “‘No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
LEV 27:30 “‘All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Adonai’s. It is holy to Adonai.
LEV 27:31 If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
LEV 27:32 All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Adonai.
LEV 27:33 He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it. If he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’”
LEV 27:34 These are the mitzvot ·instructions· which Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out] for the children of Israel [God prevails] on Mount Sinai [Thorn].
NUM 1:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] in the wilderness of Sinai [Thorn], in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·), in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], saying,

NUM 1:18 They assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·); and they declared their ancestry by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, one by one.

NUM 1:44 These are those who were counted, whom Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] counted, and the princes of Israel [God prevails], being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers’ house.

NUM 1:46 even all those who were counted were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
NUM 1:47 But the Levites [Descendants of United with] after the tribe of their fathers was not counted among them.
NUM 1:48 For Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 1:49 “Only the tribe of Levi [United with] you shall not count, neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel [God prevails];
NUM 1:50 but appoint the Levites [Descendants of United with] over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle, and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.
NUM 1:51 When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites [Descendants of United with] shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites [Descendants of United with] shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

NUM 1:54 Thus the children of Israel [God prevails] did. According to all that Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out], so they did.
NUM 2:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and to Aaron [Light-bringer], saying,
NUM 2:2 “The children of Israel [God prevails] shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ houses: at a distance from the Tent of Meeting shall they encamp around it.”

NUM 2:33 But the Levites [Descendants of United with] were not counted among the children of Israel [God prevails]; as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 2:34 Thus the children of Israel [God prevails] did. According to all that Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out], so they encamped by their standards, and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to their fathers’ houses.

NUM 7:89 When Moses [Drawn out] went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Adonai, he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.
NUM 8:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 8:2 “Speak to Aaron [Light-bringer], and tell him, ‘When you light the menorah ·lamp· candles, the seven menorah ·lamp· candles shall give light in front of the menorah ·lamp·.’”
NUM 8:3 Aaron [Light-bringer] did so. He lit its menorah ·lamp· candles to light the area in front of the menorah ·lamp·, as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 8:4 This was the workmanship of the menorah ·lamp·, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work: according to the pattern which Adonai had shown Moses [Drawn out], so he made the menorah ·lamp·.
NUM 8:5 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 8:6 “Take the Levites [Descendants of United with] from among the children of Israel [God prevails], and cleanse them.
NUM 8:7 You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of habitual sin ·missing the mark· cleanzing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
NUM 8:8 Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering.
NUM 8:9 You shall present the Levites [Descendants of United with] before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 8:10 You shall present the Levites [Descendants of United with] before Adonai. The children of Israel [God prevails] shall lay their hands on the Levites [Descendants of United with],
NUM 8:11 and Aaron [Light-bringer] shall offer the Levites [Descendants of United with] before Adonai for a wave offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel [God prevails], that it may be theirs to do the service of Adonai.
NUM 8:12 “The Levites [Descendants of United with] shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering, and the other for a burnt offering to Adonai, to make atonement for the Levites [Descendants of United with].
NUM 8:13 You shall set the Levites [Descendants of United with] before Aaron [Light-bringer], and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Adonai.
NUM 8:14 Thus you shall separate the Levites [Descendants of United with] from among the children of Israel [God prevails], and the Levites [Descendants of United with] shall be mine. (2)
NUM 8:15 “After that, the Levites [Descendants of United with] shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.
NUM 8:16 For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel [God prevails]; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel [God prevails], I have taken them to me.
NUM 8:17 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel [God prevails] are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], I sanctified them for myself.
NUM 8:18 I have taken the Levites [Descendants of United with] instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 8:19 I have given the Levites [Descendants of United with] as a gift to Aaron [Light-bringer] and to his sons from among the children of Israel [God prevails], to do the service of the children of Israel [God prevails] in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel [God prevails]; that there be no plague among the children of Israel [God prevails], when the children of Israel [God prevails] come near to the sanctuary.”
NUM 8:20 Moses [Drawn out], and Aaron [Light-bringer], and all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails] did so to the Levites [Descendants of United with]. According to all that Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out] concerning the Levites [Descendants of United with], so the children of Israel [God prevails] did to them.
NUM 8:21 The Levites [Descendants of United with] cleansed sin ·err (the standard goal)· from themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron [Light-bringer] offered them for a wave offering before Adonai; and Aaron [Light-bringer] made atonement for them to cleanse them.
NUM 8:22 After that, the Levites [Descendants of United with] went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron [Light-bringer], and before his sons: as Adonai had enjoined Moses [Drawn out] concerning the Levites [Descendants of United with], so they did to them.
NUM 8:23 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 8:24 “This is that which belongs to the Levites [Descendants of United with]: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting;
NUM 8:25 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work, and shall serve no more,
NUM 8:26 but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall do no service. You shall do thus to the Levites [Descendants of United with] concerning their duties.”
NUM 9:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] in the wilderness of Sinai [Thorn], in the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1· of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], saying,
NUM 9:2 “Moreover let the children of Israel [God prevails] keep the Pesac ·Passover· in its appointed season.
NUM 9:3 On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season— according to all its statutes, and according to all its judgments, you shall keep it.”
NUM 9:4 Moses [Drawn out] spoke to the children of Israel [God prevails], that they should keep the Pesac ·Passover·.
NUM 9:5 They kept the Pesac ·Passover· in the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai [Thorn]. According to all that Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out], so the children of Israel [God prevails] did.
NUM 9:6 There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Pesac ·Passover· on that day, and they came before Moses [Drawn out] and before Aaron [Light-bringer] on that day.
NUM 9:7 Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Adonai in its appointed season among the children of Israel [God prevails]?”
NUM 9:8 Moses [Drawn out] answered them, “Wait, that I may sh'ma ·hear obey· what Adonai will enjoin concerning you.”
NUM 9:9 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 9:10 “Say to the children of Israel [God prevails], ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Pesac ·Passover· to Adonai.
NUM 9:11 In the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·), on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with matzah ·unleavened bread· and bitter herbs.
NUM 9:12 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Pesac ·Passover· they shall keep it.
NUM 9:13 But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Pesac ·Passover·, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn’t offer the offering of Adonai in its appointed season, that man shall bear his crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal·.
NUM 9:14 “‘If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Pesac ·Passover· to Adonai; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.’” (4)
NUM 9:15 On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony: and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
NUM 9:16 So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
NUM 9:17 Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel [God prevails] traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel [God prevails] encamped.
NUM 9:18 At the order of Adonai, the children of Israel [God prevails] traveled, and at the order of Adonai they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.
NUM 9:19 When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel [God prevails] kept Adonai’s charge, and didn’t travel.
NUM 9:20 Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the order of Adonai they remained encamped, and according to the order of Adonai they traveled.
NUM 9:21 Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.
NUM 9:22 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel [God prevails] remained encamped, and didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled.
NUM 9:23 At the order of Adonai they encamped, and at the order of Adonai they traveled. They did what Adonai charged them to do through Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 10:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 10:2 “Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
NUM 10:3 When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
NUM 10:4 If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel [God prevails], shall gather themselves to you.
NUM 10:5 When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.
NUM 10:6 When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
NUM 10:7 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
NUM 10:8 “The sons of Aaron [Light-bringer], the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout all your generations.
NUM 10:9 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Adonai your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.
NUM 10:10 “Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Adonai your God.” (5)
NUM 10:11 In the second year, in the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·), on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM 10:12 The children of Israel [God prevails] went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai [Thorn]; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM 10:13 They first went forward according to the order of Adonai through Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 10:14 First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah [Praised] went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army.
NUM 10:15 Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar [Hire, Reward].
NUM 10:16 Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun [Living together].
NUM 10:17 The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward.
NUM 10:18 The standard of the camp of Reuben [See, a son!] went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army.
NUM 10:19 Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai [My rock almighty] was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon [Hearing].
NUM 10:20 Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad [Good fortune].
NUM 10:21 The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived.
NUM 10:22 The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim [Fruit] set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.
NUM 10:23 Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh [Causing to forget].
NUM 10:24 Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south].
NUM 10:25 The standard of the camp of the children of Dan [He judged], which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army.
NUM 10:26 Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher [Happy].
NUM 10:27 Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali [My wrestling].
NUM 10:28 Thus were the travels of the children of Israel [God prevails] according to their armies; and they went forward. (S:6)
NUM 10:29 Moses [Drawn out] said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite [Descendant of Strife], Moses [Drawn out]’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place of which Adonai said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Adonai has spoken good concerning Israel [God prevails].”
NUM 10:30 He said to him, “I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.”
NUM 10:31 He said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.
NUM 10:32 It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good Adonai does to us, we will do the same to you.”
NUM 10:33 They set forward from the Mount of Adonai three days’ journey. The ark of Adonai’s covenant went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.
NUM 10:34 The cloud of Adonai was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. (A:6)
NUM 10:35 When the ark went forward, Moses [Drawn out] said, “Rise up, Adonai, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!”
NUM 10:36 When it rested, he said, “Teshuvah ·Completely return·, Adonai, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel [God prevails].”
NUM 11:1 The people were complaining in the ears of Adonai. When Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it, his anger burned; and Adonai’s fire burned among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.
NUM 11:2 The people cried to Moses [Drawn out]; and Moses [Drawn out] prayed to Adonai, and the fire abated.
NUM 11:3 The name of that place was called Taberah, because Adonai’s fire burned among them.
NUM 11:4 The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel [God prevails] also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?
NUM 11:5 We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt [Abode of slavery] for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;
NUM 11:6 but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna ·what is it· to look at.”
NUM 11:7 The manna ·what is it· was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.
NUM 11:8 The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.
NUM 11:9 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna ·what is it· fell on it.
NUM 11:10 Moses [Drawn out] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Adonai’s anger burned greatly; and Moses [Drawn out] was displeased.
NUM 11:11 Moses [Drawn out] said to Adonai, “Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found chen ·grace· in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
NUM 11:12 Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’
NUM 11:13 Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’
NUM 11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
NUM 11:15 If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found chen ·grace· in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.”
NUM 11:16 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel [God prevails], whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.
NUM 11:17 I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the breath mind Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.
NUM 11:18 “Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Adonai, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt [Abode of slavery].” Therefore Adonai will give you meat, and you will eat.
NUM 11:19 You will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
NUM 11:20 but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected Adonai who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]?”’”
NUM 11:21 Moses [Drawn out] said, “The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month.’
NUM 11:22 Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”
NUM 11:23 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Has Adonai’s hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.”
NUM 11:24 Moses [Drawn out] went out, and told the people Adonai’s words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.
NUM 11:25 Adonai came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.
NUM 11:26 But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the breath mind Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
NUM 11:27 A young man ran, and told Moses [Drawn out], and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”
NUM 11:28 Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun, the servant of Moses [Drawn out], one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses [Drawn out], forbid them!”
NUM 11:29 Moses [Drawn out] said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Adonai’s people were prophets, that Adonai would put his breath mind Spirit on them!” (7)
NUM 11:30 Moses [Drawn out] went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 11:31 A wind from Adonai went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey [approximately 20 mi; 32.19 km] on this side, and a day’s journey [approximately 20 mi; 32.19 km]on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits [36 in; 91.44 cm] above the surface of the earth.
NUM 11:32 The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp.
NUM 11:33 While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, Adonai’s anger burned against the people, and Adonai struck the people with a very great plague.
NUM 11:34 The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.
NUM 11:35 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.
NUM 12:1 Miriam [Rebellion] and Aaron [Light-bringer] spoke against Moses [Drawn out] because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.
NUM 12:2 They said, “Has Adonai indeed spoken only with Moses [Drawn out]? Has not he spoken also with us?” And Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it.
NUM 12:3 Now the man Moses [Drawn out] was very humble, more than all the men who were on the surface of the earth.
NUM 12:4 Adonai spoke suddenly to Moses [Drawn out], to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to Miriam [Rebellion], “You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!” The three of them came out.
NUM 12:5 Adonai came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron [Light-bringer] and Miriam [Rebellion]; and they both came forward.
NUM 12:6 He said, “Now sh'ma ·hear obey· my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, Adonai, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.
NUM 12:7 My servant Moses [Drawn out] is not so. He is faithful in all my house.
NUM 12:8 With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Adonai’s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses [Drawn out]?”
NUM 12:9 Adonai’s anger burned against them; and he departed.
NUM 12:10 The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam [Rebellion] was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron [Light-bringer] looked at Miriam [Rebellion], and behold, she was leprous.
NUM 12:11 Aaron [Light-bringer] said to Moses [Drawn out], “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this habitual sin ·missing the mark· against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·.
NUM 12:12 Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
NUM 12:13 Moses [Drawn out] cried to Adonai, saying, “Heal her, God, I beg you!” (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
NUM 12:14 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “If her father had but spit in her face, should not she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.”
NUM 12:15 Miriam [Rebellion] was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t travel until Miriam [Rebellion] was brought in again.
NUM 12:16 Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM 13:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 13:2 “Send men on your behalf, that they may spy out the land of Canaan [Humbled], which I give to the children of Israel [God prevails]. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them.”
NUM 13:3 Moses [Drawn out] sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the order of Adonai. All them were men who were heads of the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 13:4 These were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben [See, a son!], Shammua the son of Zaccur.
NUM 13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon [Hearing], Shaphat the son of Hori.
NUM 13:6 Of the tribe of Judah [Praised], Caleb [Dog] the son of Jephunneh.
NUM 13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar [Hire, Reward], Igal the son of Joseph [May he add].
NUM 13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim [Fruit], Hoshea [Yah save] the son of Nun.
NUM 13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south], Palti the son of Raphu.
NUM 13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun [Living together], Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
NUM 13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph [May he add], of the tribe of Manasseh [Causing to forget], Gaddi the son of Susi.
NUM 13:12 Of the tribe of Dan [He judged], Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
NUM 13:13 Of the tribe of Asher [Happy], Sethur the son of Michael [Who is like God].
NUM 13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali [My wrestling], Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
NUM 13:15 Of the tribe of Gad [Good fortune], Geuel the son of Machi.
NUM 13:16 These are the names of the men who Moses [Drawn out] sent to spy out the land. Moses [Drawn out] called Hoshea [Yah save] the son of Nun, who Moses [Drawn out] renamed Joshua [Yah Salvation].
NUM 13:17 Moses [Drawn out] sent them to spy out the land of Canaan [Humbled], and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country.
NUM 13:18 See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
NUM 13:19 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
NUM 13:20 and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes. (2)
NUM 13:21 So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.
NUM 13:22 They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt [Abode of slavery].)
NUM 13:23 They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.
NUM 13:24 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel [God prevails] cut down from there.
NUM 13:25 They teshuvah ·completely returned· from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
NUM 13:26 They went and came to Moses [Drawn out], to Aaron [Light-bringer], and to all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land.
NUM 13:27 They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
NUM 13:28 However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.
NUM 13:29 Amalek [Man who licks up] dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], the Jebusite [Descendants of Thresher], and the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers] dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled] dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan [Descender].”
NUM 13:30 Caleb [Dog] stilled the people before Moses [Drawn out], and said, “Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”
NUM 13:31 But the men who went up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.”
NUM 13:32 They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.
NUM 13:33 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim. We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”
NUM 14:1 All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
NUM 14:2 All the children of Israel [God prevails] murmured against Moses [Drawn out] and against Aaron [Light-bringer]. The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], or that we had died in this wilderness!
NUM 14:3 Why does Adonai bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to teshuvah ·completely return· into Egypt [Abode of slavery]?”
NUM 14:4 They said to one another, “Let us make a captain, and let us teshuvah ·completely return· into Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
NUM 14:5 Then Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 14:6 Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun and Caleb [Dog] the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.
NUM 14:7 They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land. (3)
NUM 14:8 If Adonai delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
NUM 14:9 Only don’t rebel against Adonai, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Adonai is with us. Don’t fear them.”
NUM 14:10 But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. The kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 14:11 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not trust in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?
NUM 14:12 I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”
NUM 14:13 Moses [Drawn out] said to Adonai, “Then the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] will sh'ma ·hear obey· it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them.
NUM 14:14 They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that you Adonai are in the middle of this people; for you Adonai are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
NUM 14:15 Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the fame of you will speak, saying,
NUM 14:16 ‘Because Adonai was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.’
NUM 14:17 Now please let the power of 'Adonay [Lord] be great, according as you have spoken, saying,
NUM 14:18 ‘Adonai is slow to anger, and abundant in chesed ·loving-kindness·, forgiving depravity (moral evil) and rebellious breach of relationship; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the depravity (moral evil) of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.’
NUM 14:19 Please pardon the depravity (moral evil) of this people according to the greatness of your chesed ·loving-kindness·, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt [Abode of slavery] even until now.”
NUM 14:20 Adonai said, “I have pardoned according to your word:
NUM 14:21 but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing·;
NUM 14:22 because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt [Abode of slavery] and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my voice;
NUM 14:23 surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it.
NUM 14:24 But my servant Caleb [Dog], because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring shall possess it.
NUM 14:25 Since the Amalekite [Descendant of Man who licks up] and the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled] dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea].” (4)
NUM 14:26 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and to Aaron [Light-bringer], saying,
NUM 14:27 “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the murmurings of the children of Israel [God prevails], which they murmur against me.
NUM 14:28 Tell them, ‘As I live, says Adonai, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you.
NUM 14:29 Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
NUM 14:30 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb [Dog] the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun.
NUM 14:31 But your little ones, that you said should be captured or killed, them I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.
NUM 14:32 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
NUM 14:33 Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness.
NUM 14:34 After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your depravities (moral evils), even forty years, and you will know my alienation.’
NUM 14:35 I, Adonai, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation, who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.”
NUM 14:36 The men, whom Moses [Drawn out] sent to spy out the land, who teshuvah ·completely returned·, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,
NUM 14:37 even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Adonai.
NUM 14:38 But Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun, and Caleb [Dog] the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.
NUM 14:39 Moses [Drawn out] told these words to all the children of Israel [God prevails], and the people mourned greatly.
NUM 14:40 They rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Adonai has promised: for we have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·.”
NUM 14:41 Moses [Drawn out] said, “Why are you disobeying the order of Adonai? You shall not succeed!
NUM 14:42 Don’t go up, for Adonai is not among you; that you not be struck down before your enemies.
NUM 14:43 For there the Amalekite [Descendant of Man who licks up] and the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled] are before you, and you shall fall by the sword, because you turned back from following Adonai, therefore Adonai will not be with you.”
NUM 14:44 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of Adonai’s covenant and Moses [Drawn out] didn’t depart out of the camp.
NUM 14:45 Then the Amalekites [Descendants of Man who licks up] came down, and the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled] who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah.
NUM 15:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 15:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,
NUM 15:3 and will make an offering by fire to Adonai, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a free will offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to Adonai, of the herd, or of the flock;
NUM 15:4 then he who offers his offering shall offer to Adonai a meal offering of one tenth of an ephah [an omer; 2.3 q; 2.2 L] of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin [2.6 qt; 1.2 L] of oil.
NUM 15:5 You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin [2.6 qt; 1.2 L], with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
NUM 15:6 “‘Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering one tenth of an ephah [two omers; 4.6 q; 4.4 L] of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin [2.6 qt; 1.24 L] of oil;
NUM 15:7 and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin [2.6 qt; 1.24 L] of wine, of a pleasant aroma to Adonai. (5)
NUM 15:8 When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Adonai;
NUM 15:9 then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenths of an ephah [three omers; 6.9 q; 6.6 L] of fine flour mixed with half a hin [5.2 qt; 2.4 L] of oil:
NUM 15:10 and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin [5.2 qt; 2.4 L] of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Adonai.
NUM 15:11 Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.
NUM 15:12 According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.
NUM 15:13 “‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Adonai.
NUM 15:14 If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout all your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Adonai; as you do, so he shall do.
NUM 15:15 For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout all your generations. As you are, so shall the foreigner be before Adonai.
NUM 15:16 One Torah ·Teaching· and one judgement shall be for you, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.’” (6)
NUM 15:17 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 15:18 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you,
NUM 15:19 then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to Adonai.

NUM 15:25 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], and they shall be forgiven; for it was an unintentional mistake sin ·error·, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Adonai, and their habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering before Adonai, for their unintentional mistake sin ·error·.
NUM 15:26 All the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails] shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was an unintentional mistake sin ·error·. (7)
NUM 15:27 “‘If one person sins ·errs (the standard goal)· that is an unintentional mistake sin ·error·, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering.
NUM 15:28 The priest shall make atonement for the soul who deviates in mental error, unintentional sin ·error·, for his sin ·err (the standard goal)· is an unintentional mistake sin ·error·, before Adonai, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.
NUM 15:29 You shall have one Torah ·Teaching· for him who does any unintentional mistake sin ·error·, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel [God prevails], and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.
NUM 15:30 “‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes Adonai. That soul shall be cut off from among his people.
NUM 15:31 Because he has despised Adonai’s word, and has broken his order, that soul shall utterly be cut off. His depravity (moral evil) shall be on him.’”
NUM 15:32 While the children of Israel [God prevails] were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Shabath ·Intermission· day.
NUM 15:33 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], and to all the congregation.
NUM 15:34 They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
NUM 15:35 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.”
NUM 15:36 All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out]. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
NUM 15:37 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 15:38 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue:
NUM 15:39 and it shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look on it, and remember all Adonai’s mitzvot ·instructions·, and do them; and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to play the prostitute;
NUM 15:40 that you may remember and do all my mitzvot ·instructions·, and be holy to your God.
NUM 15:41 I am Adonai your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to be your God: I am Adonai your God.”
NUM 16:1 Now Korach [Bald one, Frost], the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi [United with], with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben [See, a son!], took some men.
NUM 16:2 They rose up before Moses [Drawn out], with some of the children of Israel [God prevails], two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown.
NUM 16:3 They assembled themselves together against Moses [Drawn out] and against Aaron [Light-bringer], and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Adonai is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Adonai’s assembly?”
NUM 16:4 When Moses [Drawn out] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it, he fell on his face.
NUM 16:5 He said to Korach [Bald one, Frost] and to all his company, “In the morning, Adonai will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him.
NUM 16:6 Do this: take censers, Korach [Bald one, Frost], and all his company;
NUM 16:7 and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Adonai tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom Adonai chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi [United with]!”
NUM 16:8 Moses [Drawn out] said to Korach [Bald one, Frost], “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· now, you sons of Levi [United with]!
NUM 16:9 Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel [God prevails] has separated you from the congregation of Israel [God prevails], to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Adonai’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
NUM 16:10 and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi [United with] with you? Do you seek the priesthood also?
NUM 16:11 Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Adonai! What is Aaron [Light-bringer] that you murmur against him?”
NUM 16:12 Moses [Drawn out] sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t come up!
NUM 16:13 Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us? (2)
NUM 16:14 Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.”
NUM 16:15 Moses [Drawn out] was very angry, and said to Adonai, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.”
NUM 16:16 Moses [Drawn out] said to Korach [Bald one, Frost], “You and all your company go before Adonai, you, and they, and Aaron [Light-bringer], tomorrow.
NUM 16:17 Each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring before Adonai his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron [Light-bringer], each his censer.”
NUM 16:18 They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer].
NUM 16:19 Korach [Bald one, Frost] assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting. The kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· appeared to all the congregation. (3)
NUM 16:20 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and to Aaron [Light-bringer], saying,
NUM 16:21 “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!”
NUM 16:22 They fell on their faces, and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin ·err (from the standard goal)·, and will you be angry with all the congregation?”
NUM 16:23 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 16:24 “Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korach [Bald one, Frost], Dathan, and Abiram!’”
NUM 16:25 Moses [Drawn out] rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel [God prevails] followed him.
NUM 16:26 He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their habitual sins ·missing the marks·!”
NUM 16:27 So they went away from the tent of Korach [Bald one, Frost], Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.
NUM 16:28 Moses [Drawn out] said, “By this you shall know that Adonai has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.
NUM 16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Adonai has not sent me.
NUM 16:30 But if Adonai makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol ·Place of the dead·; then you shall understand that these men have despised Adonai.”
NUM 16:31 As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart.
NUM 16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, all of Korach [Bald one, Frost]’s men, and all their goods.
NUM 16:33 So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol ·Place of the dead·. The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.
NUM 16:34 All Israel [God prevails] that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”
NUM 16:35 Fire came out from Adonai, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.
NUM 16:36 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 16:37 “Speak to Eleazar [Help of God] the son of Aaron [Light-bringer] the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy,
NUM 16:38 even the censers of these people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· against their own lives. Let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Adonai. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel [God prevails].”
NUM 16:39 Eleazar [Help of God] the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,
NUM 16:40 to be a memorial to the children of Israel [God prevails], to the end that no stranger, who is not of the offspring of Aaron [Light-bringer], would come near to burn incense before Adonai, that he be not as Korach [Bald one, Frost], and as his company; as Adonai spoke to him by Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 16:41 But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails] murmured against Moses [Drawn out] and against Aaron [Light-bringer], saying, “You have killed Adonai’s people!”
NUM 16:42 When the congregation was assembled against Moses [Drawn out] and against Aaron [Light-bringer], They looked toward the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· appeared.
NUM 16:43 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] came to the front of the Tent of Meeting. (4)
NUM 16:44 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 16:45 “Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces.
NUM 16:46 Moses [Drawn out] said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Adonai! The plague has begun.”
NUM 16:47 Aaron [Light-bringer] did as Moses [Drawn out] said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. Behold, the plague has begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
NUM 16:48 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
NUM 16:49 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korach [Bald one, Frost].
NUM 16:50 Aaron [Light-bringer] teshuvah ·completely returned· to Moses [Drawn out] to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped.
NUM 17:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 17:2 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and take rods from them, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods. Write each man’s name on his rod.
NUM 17:3 You shall write Aaron [Light-bringer]’s name on the rod of Levi [United with]; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.
NUM 17:4 You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
NUM 17:5 It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud. I will make the murmurings of the children of Israel [God prevails], which they murmur against you, cease from me.”
NUM 17:6 Moses [Drawn out] spoke to the children of Israel [God prevails]; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods. Aaron [Light-bringer]’s rod was among their rods.
NUM 17:7 Moses [Drawn out] laid up the rods before Adonai in the Tent of the Testimony.
NUM 17:8 On the next day, Moses [Drawn out] went into the Tent of the Testimony; and behold, Aaron [Light-bringer]’s rod for the house of Levi [United with] had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
NUM 17:9 Moses [Drawn out] brought out all the rods from before Adonai to all the children of Israel [God prevails]. They looked, and each man took his rod. (6)
NUM 17:10 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Put back the rod of Aaron [Light-bringer] before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die.”
NUM 17:11 Moses [Drawn out] did so. As Adonai enjoined him, so he did.
NUM 17:12 The children of Israel [God prevails] spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying, “Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone!
NUM 17:13 Everyone who keeps approaching Adonai’s tabernacle, dies! Will we all perish?”
NUM 18:1 Adonai said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “You and your sons and your fathers’ house with you shall bear the depravity (moral evil) of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the depravity (moral evil) of your priesthood.
NUM 18:2 Bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi [United with], the tribe of your father, near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you; but you and your sons with you shall be before the Tent of the Testimony.
NUM 18:3 They shall keep your orders, and the duty of the whole Tent; only they shall not come near to the utensils of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you.
NUM 18:4 They shall be joined to you, and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. A stranger shall not come near to you.
NUM 18:5 “You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary and the duty of the altar, that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 18:6 Behold, I myself have taken your brothers the Levites [Descendants of United with] from among the children of Israel [God prevails]. They are a gift to you, dedicated to Adonai, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting.
NUM 18:7 You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil. You shall serve. I give you the service of the priesthood as a gift. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.”
NUM 18:8 Adonai spoke to Aaron [Light-bringer], “Behold, I myself have given you the charge of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel [God prevails]. I have given them to you by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a chok ·portion· forever.
NUM 18:9 This shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every habitual sin ·miss the mark· offering of theirs, and every fault incurring guilt offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
NUM 18:10 You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.
NUM 18:11 “This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel [God prevails]. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a chok ·portion· forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
NUM 18:12 “I have given to you all the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to Adonai.
NUM 18:13 The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Adonai, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.
NUM 18:14 “Everything devoted in Israel [God prevails] shall be yours.
NUM 18:15 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Adonai, both of man and animal shall be yours. Nevertheless, you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals.
NUM 18:16 You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels [2 oz; 56.7 g] of money, after the shekel of the sanctuary, (the shekel is 0.4 oz; 11.34 g; or called twenty gerahs 20/50 of an oz)
NUM 18:17 “But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to Adonai.
NUM 18:18 Their meat shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.
NUM 18:19 All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel [God prevails] offer to Adonai, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a chok ·portion· forever. It is a covenant of salt forever before Adonai to you and to your offspring with you.”
NUM 18:20 Adonai said to Aaron [Light-bringer], “You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel [God prevails]. (7)
NUM 18:21 “To the children of Levi [United with], behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel [God prevails] for an inheritance, in teshuvah ·complete return· for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting.
NUM 18:22 Henceforth the children of Israel [God prevails] shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal·, and die.

NUM 18:24 For the tithe of the children of Israel [God prevails], which they offer as a wave offering to Adonai, I have given to the Levites [Descendants of United with] for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, ‘Among the children of Israel [God prevails] they shall have no inheritance.’”
NUM 18:25 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 18:26 “Moreover you shall speak to the Levites [Descendants of United with], and tell them, ‘When you take of the children of Israel [God prevails] the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Adonai, a tithe of the tithe.
NUM 18:27 Your wave offering shall be credited to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.

NUM 20:1 The children of Israel [God prevails], even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·. The people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam [Rebellion] died there, and was buried there.
NUM 20:2 There was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses [Drawn out] and against Aaron [Light-bringer].
NUM 20:3 The people quarreled with Moses [Drawn out], and spoke, saying, “We wish that we had died when our brothers died before Adonai!
NUM 20:4 Why have you brought Adonai’s assembly into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals?
NUM 20:5 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.”
NUM 20:6 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces. The kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· appeared to them. (RY:2, LY:3)
NUM 20:7 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 20:8 “Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron [Light-bringer] your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it pour out its water. You shall bring water to them out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink.”
NUM 20:9 Moses [Drawn out] took the rod from before Adonai, as he enjoined him.
NUM 20:10 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· now, you rebels! Shall we bring water out of this rock for you?”
NUM 20:11 Moses [Drawn out] lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice, and water came out abundantly. The congregation and their livestock drank.
NUM 20:12 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer], “Because you didn’t trust in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel [God prevails], therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”
NUM 20:13 These are the waters of Meribah [Quarreling]; because the children of Israel [God prevails] strove with Yahweh M’Kaddesh [Yahweh our Santifier / He sustains breathing who makes you holy] who was set apart by them. (LY:4)
NUM 20:14 Moses [Drawn out] sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom [Red], saying: “Thus says your brother Israel [God prevails]: You know all the travail that has happened to us;
NUM 20:15 how our fathers went down into Egypt [Abode of slavery], and we lived in Egypt [Abode of slavery] a long time. The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] mistreated us and our fathers.
NUM 20:16 When we cried to Adonai, he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of your border.
NUM 20:17 “Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the king’s highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.”
NUM 20:18 Edom [Red] said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.”
NUM 20:19 The children of Israel [God prevails] said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.”
NUM 20:20 He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom [Red] came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.
NUM 20:21 Thus Edom [Red] refused to give Israel [God prevails] passage through his border, so Israel [God prevails] turned away from him. (RY:3, LY:5)
NUM 20:22 They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel [God prevails], even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
NUM 20:23 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom [Red], saying,
NUM 20:24 “Aaron [Light-bringer] shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel [God prevails], because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah [Quarreling].
NUM 20:25 Take Aaron [Light-bringer] and Eleazar [Help of God] his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
NUM 20:26 and strip Aaron [Light-bringer] of his garments, and put them on Eleazar [Help of God] his son. Aaron [Light-bringer] shall be taken, and shall die there.”
NUM 20:27 Moses [Drawn out] did as Adonai enjoined. They went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
NUM 20:28 Moses [Drawn out] stripped Aaron [Light-bringer] of his garments, and put them on Eleazar [Help of God] his son. Aaron [Light-bringer] died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses [Drawn out] and Eleazar [Help of God] came down from the mountain.
NUM 20:29 When all the congregation saw that Aaron [Light-bringer] was dead, they wept for Aaron [Light-bringer] thirty days, even all the house of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 21:1 The Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], the king of Arad, who lived in the South, sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that Israel [God prevails] came by the way of Atharim. He fought against Israel [God prevails], and took some of them captive.
NUM 21:2 Israel [God prevails] vowed a vow to Adonai, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”
NUM 21:3 Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of Israel [God prevails], and delivered up the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled]; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was called Hormah.
NUM 21:4 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea], to go around the land of Edom [Red] The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey.
NUM 21:5 The people spoke against God, and against Moses [Drawn out], “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread.” (LY:6)
NUM 21:6 Adonai sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel [God prevails] died.
NUM 21:7 The people came to Moses [Drawn out], and said, “We have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·, because we have spoken against Adonai, and against you. Pray to Adonai, that he take away the serpents from us.” Moses [Drawn out] prayed for the people.
NUM 21:8 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Make a fiery serpent, and set it up on a pole. It shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.”
NUM 21:9 Moses [Drawn out] made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, he lived.
NUM 21:10 The children of Israel [God prevails] traveled, and encamped in Oboth.
NUM 21:11 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab [From father], toward the sunrise.
NUM 21:12 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.
NUM 21:13 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers]: for the Arnon is the border of Moab [From father], between Moab [From father] and the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers].
NUM 21:14 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Adonai, “Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,
NUM 21:15 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab [From father].”
NUM 21:16 From there they traveled to Beer; that is the well of which Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”
NUM 21:17 Then Israel [God prevails] sang this song: “Spring up, well! Sing to it,
NUM 21:18 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles.” From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;
NUM 21:19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
NUM 21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab [From father], to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert. (RY:4, LY:7)
NUM 21:21 Israel [God prevails] sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], saying,
NUM 21:22 “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.”
NUM 21:23 Sihon would not allow Israel [God prevails] to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel [God prevails] into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel [God prevails].
NUM 21:24 Israel [God prevails] struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon [Tribal people]; for the border of the children of Ammon [Tribal people] was strong.
NUM 21:25 Israel [God prevails] took all these cities. Israel [God prevails] lived in all the cities of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
NUM 21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], who had fought against the former king of Moab [From father], and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.
NUM 21:27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established;
NUM 21:28 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab [From father], The lords of the high places of the Arnon.
NUM 21:29 Woe to you, Moab [From father]! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers].
NUM 21:30 We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba.”
NUM 21:31 Thus Israel [God prevails] lived in the land of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers].
NUM 21:32 Moses [Drawn out] sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers] who were there.
NUM 21:33 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. (LY: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
NUM 21:34 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], who lived at Heshbon.”
NUM 21:35 So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.
NUM 22:1 The children of Israel [God prevails] traveled on and encamped in the plains of Moab [From father] beyond the Jordan [Descender] River, opposite Jericho [Fragrant, Moon].
NUM 22:2 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel [God prevails] had done to the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers].
NUM 22:3 Moab [From father] was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab [From father] was distressed because of the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 22:4 Moab [From father] said to the elders of Midian [Strife], “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab [From father] at that time.
NUM 22:5 He sent messengers to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.
NUM 22:6 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may divorce them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”
NUM 22:7 The elders of Moab [From father] and the elders of Midian [Strife] departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and spoke to him the words of Balak.
NUM 22:8 He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Adonai shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab [From father] stayed with Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people].
NUM 22:9 God came to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and said, “Who are these men with you?”
NUM 22:10 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab [From father], has said to me,
NUM 22:11 ‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse me them. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’”
NUM 22:12 God said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed.” (RY:5, LY:2)
NUM 22:13 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for Adonai refuses to permit me to go with you.”
NUM 22:14 The princes of Moab [From father] rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] refuses to come with us.”
NUM 22:15 Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they.
NUM 22:16 They came to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,
NUM 22:17 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’”
NUM 22:18 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Adonai my God, to do less or more.
NUM 22:19 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what Adonai will speak to me more.”
NUM 22:20 God came to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.” (LY:3)
NUM 22:21 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab [From father].
NUM 22:22 God’s anger burned because he went; and ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing] placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
NUM 22:23 The donkey saw ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing] standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field. Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.
NUM 22:24 Then ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing] stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
NUM 22:25 The donkey saw ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing], and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people]’s foot against the wall. He struck her again.
NUM 22:26 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
NUM 22:27 The donkey saw ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing], and she lay down under Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people]. Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people]’s anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
NUM 22:28 Adonai opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”
NUM 22:29 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.”
NUM 22:30 The donkey said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?” He said, “No.”
NUM 22:31 Then Adonai opened the eyes of Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and he saw ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing] standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
NUM 22:32 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.
NUM 22:33 The donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.”
NUM 22:34 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing], “I have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.”
NUM 22:35 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.” So Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] went with the princes of Balak.
NUM 22:36 When Balak sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab [From father], which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.
NUM 22:37 Balak said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “Didn’t I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?”
NUM 22:38 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.” (RY:6, LY:4)
NUM 22:39 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.
NUM 22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and to the princes who were with him.
NUM 22:41 In the morning, Balak took Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people.
NUM 23:1 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.”
NUM 23:2 Balak did as Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] had spoken; and Balak and Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] offered on every altar a bull and a ram.
NUM 23:3 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Adonai will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.” He went to a bare height.
NUM 23:4 God met Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.”
NUM 23:5 Adonai put a word in Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people]’s mouth, and said, “Teshuvah ·Completely return· to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”
NUM 23:6 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab [From father].
NUM 23:7 He took up his parable, and said, “From Aram [Elevated] has Balak brought me, the king of Moab [From father] from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob [Supplanter] for me. Come, defy Israel [God prevails].
NUM 23:8 How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom Adonai has not defied?
NUM 23:9 For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be listed among the nations.
NUM 23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob [Supplanter], or count the fourth part of Israel [God prevails]? Let me die the death of the upright! Let my last end be like his!”
NUM 23:11 Balak said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.”
NUM 23:12 He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Adonai puts in my mouth?” (LY:5)
NUM 23:13 Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.”
NUM 23:14 He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
NUM 23:15 He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there.”
NUM 23:16 Adonai met Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Teshuvah ·Completely return· to Balak, and say this.”
NUM 23:17 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab [From father] with him. Balak said to him, “What has Adonai spoken?”
NUM 23:18 He took up his parable, and said, “Rise up, Balak, and sh'ma ·hear obey·! Listen to me, you son of Zippor.
NUM 23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?
NUM 23:20 Behold, I am ordered to bless. When he blesses, and I can’t reverse it.
NUM 23:21 He has not seen vain striving of iniquity in Jacob [Supplanter]. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel [God prevails]. Adonai his God is with him. The shout of a king is among them.
NUM 23:22 God brings them out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
NUM 23:23 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob [Supplanter]; Neither is there any divination with Israel [God prevails]. Now it shall be said of Jacob [Supplanter] and of Israel [God prevails], ‘What has God done!’
NUM 23:24 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness. As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain.”
NUM 23:25 Balak said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”
NUM 23:26 But Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that Adonai speaks, that I must do?’” (RY:7, LY:6)
NUM 23:27 Balak said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”
NUM 23:28 Balak took Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.
NUM 23:29 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”
NUM 23:30 Balak did as Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.
NUM 24:1 When Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] saw that it pleased Adonai to bless Israel [God prevails], he didn’t go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
NUM 24:2 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel [God prevails] dwelling according to their tribes; and the breath mind Spirit of God came on him.
NUM 24:3 He took up his parable, and said, “Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] the son of Beor says, the man whose eyes are open says;
NUM 24:4 he says, who sh'ma ·hears obeys· the words of God, who sees the vision of Shaddai [Almighty], falling down, and having his eyes open:
NUM 24:5 How goodly are your tents, Jacob [Supplanter], and your tents, Israel [God prevails]!
NUM 24:6 As valleys they are spread out, as gardens by the riverside, as aloes which Adonai has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.
NUM 24:7 Water shall flow from his buckets. His seed shall be in many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. His kingdom shall be exalted.
NUM 24:8 God brings him out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows.
NUM 24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Everyone who blesses you is blessed. Everyone who curses you is cursed.”
NUM 24:10 Balak’s anger burned against Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], “I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
NUM 24:11 Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Adonai has kept you back from honor.”
NUM 24:12 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,
NUM 24:13 ‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond Adonai’s word, to do either good or bad of my own mind. I will say what Adonai says’? (LY:7)
NUM 24:14 Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.”
NUM 24:15 He took up his parable, and said, “Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] the son of Beor says, the man whose eyes are open says;
NUM 24:16 he says, who sh'ma ·hears obeys· the words of God, knows the knowledge of haElyon [the Most High], and who sees the vision of Shaddai [Almighty], Falling down, and having his eyes open:
NUM 24:17 I see him, but not now. I see him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob [Supplanter]. A scepter will rise out of Israel [God prevails], and shall strike through the corners of Moab [From father], and break down all the sons of Sheth.
NUM 24:18 Edom [Red] shall be a possession. Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession, while Israel [God prevails] does valiantly.
NUM 24:19 Out of Jacob [Supplanter] shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city.”
NUM 24:20 He looked at Amalek [Man who licks up], and took up his parable, and said, “Amalek [Man who licks up] was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall come to destruction.”
NUM 24:21 He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, “Your dwelling place is strong. Your nest is set in the rock.
NUM 24:22 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries you away captive.”
NUM 24:23 He took up his parable, and said, “Alas, who shall live when God does this?
NUM 24:24 But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim. They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber. He also shall come to destruction.”
NUM 24:25 Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] rose up, and went and teshuvah ·completely returned· to his place; and Balak also went his way.
NUM 25:1 Israel [God prevails] stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab [From father];
NUM 25:2 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their deities. The people ate and bowed down to their deities.
NUM 25:3 Israel [God prevails] joined himself to Baal Peor. Adonai’s anger burned against Israel [God prevails].
NUM 25:4 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Adonai before the sun, that the fierce anger of Adonai may turn away from Israel [God prevails].”
NUM 25:5 Moses [Drawn out] said to the judges of Israel [God prevails], “Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.”
NUM 25:6 Behold, one of the children of Israel [God prevails] came and brought to his brothers a Midianite [Descendant of Strife] woman in the sight of Moses [Drawn out], and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
NUM 25:7 When Pinchas [Bronze skin], the son of Eleazar [Help of God], the son of Aaron [Light-bringer] the priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.
NUM 25:8 He went after the man of Israel [God prevails] into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel [God prevails], and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 25:9 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
NUM 25:10 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 25:11 “Pinchas [Bronze skin], the son of Eleazar [Help of God], the son of Aaron [Light-bringer] the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel [God prevails], in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel [God prevails] in my jealousy.
NUM 25:12 Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of peace.
NUM 25:13 It shall be to him, and to his offspring after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel [God prevails].’”
NUM 25:14 Now the name of the man of Israel [God prevails] that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite [Descendant of Strife] woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.
NUM 25:15 The name of the Midianite [Descendant of Strife] woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian [Strife].
NUM 25:16 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 25:17 “Harass the Midianites [Descendants of Strife], and strike them,
NUM 25:18 for they harassed you with their wiles, with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian [Strife], their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.”
NUM 26:1 After the plague, Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] and to Eleazar [Help of God] the son of Aaron [Light-bringer] the priest, saying,
NUM 26:2 “Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to war in Israel [God prevails].”
NUM 26:3 Moses [Drawn out] and Eleazar [Help of God] the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab [From father] by the Jordan [Descender] at Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], saying,

NUM 27:5 Moses [Drawn out] brought their mishpat ·case· before Adonai. (4)
NUM 27:6 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 27:7 “The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brothers. You shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.
NUM 27:8 You shall speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, ‘If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.

NUM 27:13 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron [Light-bringer] your brother was gathered;
NUM 27:14 because in the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, to honor me as holy at the waters before their eyes.” (These are the waters of Meribah [Quarreling] of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
NUM 27:15 Moses [Drawn out] spoke to Adonai, saying,
NUM 27:16 “Let Adonai, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
NUM 27:17 who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Adonai not be as sheep which have no shepherd.”
NUM 27:18 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Take Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun, a man in whom is the breath mind Spirit, and lay your hand on him.
NUM 27:19 Set him before Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, and before all the congregation; and enjoin him in their sight.

NUM 29:40 Moses [Drawn out] told the children of Israel [God prevails] according to all that Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 30:1 Moses [Drawn out] spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel [God prevails], saying, “This is the thing which Adonai has enjoined.
NUM 30:2 When a man vows a vow to Adonai , or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
NUM 30:3 “Also when a woman vows a vow to Adonai, and binds herself by a bond, being in her father’s house, in her youth,
NUM 30:4 and her father sh'ma ·hears obeys· her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
NUM 30:5 But if her father forbids her in the day that he sh'ma ·hears obeys·, none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand. Adonai will forgive her, because her father has forbidden her.
NUM 30:6 “If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul,
NUM 30:7 and her husband sh'ma ·hears obeys· it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he sh'ma ·hears obeys· it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
NUM 30:8 But if her husband forbids her in the day that he sh'ma ·hears obeys· it, then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul. Adonai will forgive her.
NUM 30:9 “But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul, shall stand against her.
NUM 30:10 “If she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
NUM 30:11 and her husband sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it, and held his peace at her, and didn’t disallow her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
NUM 30:12 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has made them void. Adonai will forgive her.
NUM 30:13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
NUM 30:14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her. He has established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· them.
NUM 30:15 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her depravity (moral evil).”
NUM 30:16 These are the statutes which Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out], between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.
NUM 31:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 31:2 “Avenge the children of Israel [God prevails] for the Midianites [Descendants of Strife]. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.”
NUM 31:3 Moses [Drawn out] spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian [Strife], to execute Adonai’s vengeance on Midian [Strife].
NUM 31:4 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel [God prevails], you shall send to the war.”
NUM 31:5 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel [God prevails], a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
NUM 31:6 Moses [Drawn out] sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Pinchas [Bronze skin] the son of Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, to the war, with the utensils of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
NUM 31:7 They fought against Midian [Strife], as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out]. They killed every male.
NUM 31:8 They killed the kings of Midian [Strife] with the rest of their slain: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian [Strife]. They also killed Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] the son of Beor with the sword.
NUM 31:9 The children of Israel [God prevails] took the women of Midian [Strife] captive with their little ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and all their goods, they took as plunder.
NUM 31:10 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burned with fire.
NUM 31:11 They took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of man and of animal.
NUM 31:12 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the plunder, to Moses [Drawn out], and to Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel [God prevails], to the camp at the plains of Moab [From father], which are by the Jordan [Descender] at Jericho [Fragrant, Moon]. (RY:2, LY:3)
NUM 31:13 Moses [Drawn out], and Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went out to meet them outside of the camp.
NUM 31:14 Moses [Drawn out] was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.
NUM 31:15 Moses [Drawn out] said to them, “Have you saved all the women alive?
NUM 31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel [God prevails], through the counsel of Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people], to commit an unfaithful act against Adonai in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Adonai.
NUM 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.
NUM 31:18 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
NUM 31:19 “Encamp outside of the camp seven days. Whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, cleanse sin ·err (the standard goal)· from yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives.
NUM 31:20 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood, you shall purify yourselves.”
NUM 31:21 Eleazar [Help of God] the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, “This is the statute of the Torah ·Teaching· which Adonai has enjoined Moses [Drawn out]:
NUM 31:22 however the gold, and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
NUM 31:23 everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be cleansed from sin ·err (the standard goal)· with the water for impurity. All that does not withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water.
NUM 31:24 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. Afterward you shall come into the camp.” (LY:4)
NUM 31:25 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 31:26 “Count the plunder that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation;
NUM 31:27 and divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
NUM 31:28 Levy a tribute to Adonai of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks.
NUM 31:29 Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, for Adonai’s wave offering.
NUM 31:30 Of the children of Israel [God prevails]’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites [Descendants of United with], who perform the duty of Adonai’s tabernacle.”
NUM 31:31 Moses [Drawn out] and Eleazar [Help of God] the priest did as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 31:32 Now the plunder, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
NUM 31:33 and seventy-two thousand head of cattle,
NUM 31:34 and sixty-one thousand donkeys,
NUM 31:35 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him.
NUM 31:36 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:
NUM 31:37 and Adonai’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.
NUM 31:38 The cattle were thirty-six thousand; of which Adonai’s tribute was seventy-two.
NUM 31:39 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which Adonai’s tribute was sixty-one.
NUM 31:40 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Adonai’s tribute was thirty-two persons.
NUM 31:41 Moses [Drawn out] gave the tribute, which was Adonai’s wave offering, to Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out]. (LY:5)
NUM 31:42 Of the children of Israel [God prevails]’s half, which Moses [Drawn out] divided off from the men who fought
NUM 31:43 (now the congregation’s half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
NUM 31:44 and thirty-six thousand head of cattle,
NUM 31:45 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
NUM 31:46 and sixteen thousand persons),
NUM 31:47 even of the children of Israel [God prevails]’s half, Moses [Drawn out] took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites [Descendants of United with], who performed the duty of Adonai’s tabernacle; as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 31:48 The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses [Drawn out].
NUM 31:49 They said to Moses [Drawn out], “Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.
NUM 31:50 We have brought Adonai’s offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Adonai.”
NUM 31:51 Moses [Drawn out] and Eleazar [Help of God] the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels.
NUM 31:52 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Adonai, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels [418.75 lb; 189.95 kg].
NUM 31:53 The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.
NUM 31:54 Moses [Drawn out] and Eleazar [Help of God] the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel [God prevails] before Adonai.
NUM 32:1 Now the children of Reuben [See, a son!] and the children of Gad [Good fortune] had a very great multitude of livestock. When they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for livestock;
NUM 32:2 the children of Gad [Good fortune] and the children of Reuben [See, a son!] came and spoke to Moses [Drawn out], and to Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
NUM 32:3 “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
NUM 32:4 the land which Adonai struck before the congregation of Israel [God prevails], is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.”
NUM 32:5 They said, “If we have found chen ·grace· in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Don’t bring us over the Jordan [Descender].”
NUM 32:6 Moses [Drawn out] said to the children of Gad [Good fortune], and to the children of Reuben [See, a son!], “Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall you sit here?
NUM 32:7 Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel [God prevails] from going over into the land which Adonai has given them?
NUM 32:8 Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea [Consecrated Son-inconstant] to see the land.
NUM 32:9 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel [God prevails], that they should not go into the land which Adonai had given them.
NUM 32:10 Adonai’s anger burned in that day, and he swore, saying,
NUM 32:11 ‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter]; because they have not wholly followed me,
NUM 32:12 except Caleb [Dog] the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun; because they have followed Adonai completely.’
NUM 32:13 Adonai’s anger burned against Israel [God prevails], and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in Adonai’s sight, was consumed.
NUM 32:14 “Behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of men who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal·, to increase the fierce anger of Adonai toward Israel [God prevails].
NUM 32:15 For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all these people.”
NUM 32:16 They came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones;
NUM 32:17 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel [God prevails], until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
NUM 32:18 We will not teshuvah ·completely return· to our houses, until the children of Israel [God prevails] have each inherited their inheritance.
NUM 32:19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan [Descender], and forward; because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan [Descender] eastward.” (RY:4, LY:7)
NUM 32:20 Moses [Drawn out] said to them, “If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Adonai to the war,
NUM 32:21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan [Descender] before Adonai, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
NUM 32:22 and the land is subdued before Adonai; then afterward you shall teshuvah ·completely return·, and be guiltless towards Adonai, and towards Israel [God prevails]; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Adonai.
NUM 32:23 “But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· against Adonai; and be sure your habitual sin ·missing the mark· will find you out.
NUM 32:24 Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.”
NUM 32:25 The children of Gad [Good fortune] and the children of Reuben [See, a son!] spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying, “Your servants will do as my lord enjoins us.
NUM 32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
NUM 32:27 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Adonai to battle, as my lord says.”
NUM 32:28 So Moses [Drawn out] enjoined concerning them to Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, and to Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 32:29 Moses [Drawn out] said to them, “If the children of Gad [Good fortune] and the children of Reuben [See, a son!] will pass with you over the Jordan [Descender], every man who is armed to battle, before Adonai, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
NUM 32:30 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan [Humbled].”
NUM 32:31 The children of Gad [Good fortune] and the children of Reuben [See, a son!] answered, saying, “As Adonai has said to your servants, so will we do.
NUM 32:32 We will pass over armed before Adonai into the land of Canaan [Humbled], and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan [Descender].”
NUM 32:33 Moses [Drawn out] gave to them, even to the children of Gad [Good fortune], and to the children of Reuben [See, a son!], and to the half-tribe of Manasseh [Causing to forget] the son of Joseph [May he add], the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.
NUM 32:34 The children of Gad [Good fortune] built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
NUM 32:35 Atrothshophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
NUM 32:36 Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran [Mountaineer]: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
NUM 32:37 The children of Reuben [See, a son!] built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
NUM 32:38 Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah. They gave other names to the cities which they built. (LY: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
NUM 32:39 The children of Machir the son of Manasseh [Causing to forget] went to Gilead, took it, and dispossessed the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers] who were therein.
NUM 32:40 Moses [Drawn out] gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh [Causing to forget]; and he lived therein.
NUM 32:41 Jair the son of Manasseh [Causing to forget] went and took its villages, and called them Havvoth Jair.
NUM 32:42 Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
NUM 33:1 These are the stages in the journeys of the children of Israel [God prevails], as they left the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] divided into groups under the leadership of Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer].
NUM 33:2 Moses [Drawn out] recorded each of the stages of their journeys by the order of Adonai. These are their journeys according to their goings out.
NUM 33:3 They traveled from Rameses in the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·, on the fifteenth day of the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·; on the next day after the Pesac ·Passover·, the children of Israel [God prevails] went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery],
NUM 33:4 while the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] were burying all their firstborn, whom Adonai had struck among them. Adonai also executed judgments on their deities.

NUM 33:6 They traveled from Sukkot, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.
NUM 33:7 They traveled from Etham, and turned back to Pihahiroth, which is before Baal Zephon: and they encamped before Migdol.

NUM 33:54 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
NUM 33:55 “But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land in which you dwell.

NUM 34:14 for the tribe of the children of Reuben [See, a son!] according to their fathers’ houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad [Good fortune] according to their fathers’ houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh [Causing to forget] have received, their inheritance.
NUM 34:15 The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan [Descender] at Jericho [Fragrant, Moon] eastward, toward the sunrise.” (RY:6, LY:4)
NUM 34:16 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 34:17 “These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar [Help of God] the priest, and Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun.
NUM 34:18 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.
NUM 34:19 These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah [Praised], Caleb [Dog] the son of Jephunneh.
NUM 34:20 Of the tribe of the children of Simeon [Hearing], Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
NUM 34:21 Of the tribe of Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south], Elidad the son of Chislon.

NUM 34:24 Of the tribe of the children of Ephraim [Fruit] a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
NUM 34:25 Of the tribe of the children of Zebulun [Living together] a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
NUM 34:26 Of the tribe of the children of Issachar [Hire, Reward] a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan.

NUM 34:28 Of the tribe of the children of Naphtali [My wrestling] a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”
NUM 34:29 These are they whom Adonai enjoined to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel [God prevails] in the land of Canaan [Humbled].
NUM 35:1 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] in the plains of Moab [From father] by the Jordan [Descender] at Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], saying,
NUM 35:2 “Enjoin the children of Israel [God prevails] to give to the Levites [Descendants of United with] of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in. You shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Levites [Descendants of United with].
NUM 35:3 They shall have the cities to dwell in. Their suburbs shall be for their livestock, and for their possessions, and for all their animals.
NUM 35:4 “The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites [Descendants of United with], shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits [1/3 mi; 457.2 km] around it.
NUM 35:5 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits [1/2 mi; 914 km], and for the south side two thousand cubits [1/2 mi; 914 km], and for the west side two thousand cubits [1/2 mi; 914 km], and for the north side two thousand cubits [1/2 mi; 914 km], the city being in the middle. This shall be the suburbs of their cities.
NUM 35:6 “The cities which you shall give to the Levites [Descendants of United with], they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the man slayer to flee to. Besides them you shall give forty-two cities.
NUM 35:7 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites [Descendants of United with] shall be forty-eight cities together with their suburbs.

Everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give some of his cities to the Levites [Descendants of United with].” (RY:7, LY:6)
NUM 35:9 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out], saying,
NUM 35:10 “Speak to the children of Israel [God prevails], and tell them, ‘When you pass over the Jordan [Descender] into the land of Canaan [Humbled],
NUM 35:11 then you shall appoint for yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the man slayer who kills any person unintentionally by mistake sin ·error· may flee there.
NUM 35:12 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger, that the man slayer not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment.
NUM 35:13 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.
NUM 35:14 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan [Descender], and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan [Humbled]. They shall be cities of refuge.

NUM 36:1 The heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh [Causing to forget], of the families of the sons of Joseph [May he add], came near, and spoke before Moses [Drawn out], and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel [God prevails].
NUM 36:2 They said, “Adonai enjoined my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel [God prevails]. My lord was enjoined by Adonai to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
NUM 36:3 If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel [God prevails], then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong.

NUM 36:6 This is the thing which Adonai does enjoin concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them be married to whom they think best; only they shall marry into the family of the tribe of their father.

NUM 36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out]:
NUM 36:11 for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah [Rest], the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their dod ·father’s· brothers’ sons.
NUM 36:12 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh [Causing to forget] the son of Joseph [May he add]. Their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
NUM 36:13 These are the mitzvot ·instructions· and the judgments which Adonai enjoined by the hand of Moses [Drawn out] to the children of Israel [God prevails] in the plains of Moab [From father] by the Jordan [Descender] across from Jericho [Fragrant, Moon].
DEU 1:1 These are the words which Moses [Drawn out] spoke to all Israel [God prevails] beyond the Jordan [Descender] in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban [White], Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
DEU 1:2 It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb [Desert] by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea [Consecrated Son-inconstant].
DEU 1:3 In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month Shevat ·Staff / Rod / Royal scepter·, on the first day of the month, Moses [Drawn out] spoke to the children of Israel [God prevails], according to all that Adonai had given Moses [Drawn out], words of enjoinings to them;
DEU 1:4 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
DEU 1:5 Beyond the Jordan [Descender], in the land of Moab [From father], Moses [Drawn out] began to declare this Torah ·Teaching·, saying,
DEU 1:6 “Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] spoke to us in Horeb [Desert], saying, ‘You have lived long enough at this mountain.
DEU 1:7 Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], and to all the places near there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled], and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates [Fruitful].
DEU 1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land which Adonai swore to your fathers, to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter], to give to them and to their offspring after them.’”
DEU 1:9 I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone.
DEU 1:10 Adonai your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude.
DEU 1:11 Adonai, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you! (2)
DEU 1:12 How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife?
DEU 1:13 Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.”
DEU 1:14 You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.”
DEU 1:15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
DEU 1:16 I enjoined your judges at that time, saying, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.
DEU 1:17 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall sh'ma ·hear obey· the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will sh'ma ·hear obey· it.”
DEU 1:18 I enjoined you at that time all the things which you should do.
DEU 1:19 We traveled from Horeb [Desert], and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], as Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] enjoined us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea [Consecrated Son-inconstant].
DEU 1:20 I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], which Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] gives to us.
DEU 1:21 Behold, Adonai your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Adonai, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.” (3)
DEU 1:22 You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.”
DEU 1:23 The thing pleased me well. I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.
DEU 1:24 They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
DEU 1:25 They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] gives to us.”
DEU 1:26 Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the order of Adonai your God.
DEU 1:27 You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Adonai hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], to destroy us.
DEU 1:28 Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’”
DEU 1:29 Then I said to you, “Don’t dread, neither be afraid of them.
DEU 1:30 Adonai your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt [Abode of slavery] before your eyes,
DEU 1:31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Adonai your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.”
DEU 1:32 Yet in this thing you didn’t trust Adonai your God,
DEU 1:33 who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.
DEU 1:34 Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
DEU 1:35 “Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
DEU 1:36 except Caleb [Dog] the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Adonai.”
DEU 1:37 Also Adonai was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there.
DEU 1:38 Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel [God prevails] to inherit it. (4)
DEU 1:39 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be captured or killed, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and I will give it to, and they shall possess it.
DEU 1:40 But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea].”
DEU 1:41 Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· against Adonai, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] enjoined us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.
DEU 1:42 Adonai said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.’”
DEU 1:43 So I spoke to you, and you didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey·; but you rebelled against the order of Adonai, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.
DEU 1:44 The Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.
DEU 1:45 You made teshuvah ·complete return· and wept before Adonai; but Adonai didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· unto your voice, nor turn his ear to you.
DEU 1:46 So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.
DEU 2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea], as Adonai spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. (5)
DEU 2:2 Adonai spoke to me, saying,
DEU 2:3 “You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.
DEU 2:4 Enjoin the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your cousins the children of Esau [Hairy], who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful.
DEU 2:5 Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of your foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau [Hairy] for a possession.
DEU 2:6 You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’”
DEU 2:7 For Adonai your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Adonai your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.
DEU 2:8 So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau [Hairy], who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab [From father].
DEU 2:9 Adonai said to me, “Don’t bother Moab [From father], neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot [Veil, Covering] for a possession.”
DEU 2:10 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim.
DEU 2:11 These also are considered to be Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one], as the Anakim; but the Moabites [Descendants of From father] call them Emim.
DEU 2:12 The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau [Hairy] succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel [God prevails] did to the land of his possession, which Adonai gave to them.)
DEU 2:13 “Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered.
DEU 2:14 The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea [Consecrated Son-inconstant], until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Adonai swore to them.
DEU 2:15 Moreover Adonai’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed.
DEU 2:16 So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
DEU 2:17 Adonai spoke to me, saying,
DEU 2:18 “You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab [From father], today.
DEU 2:19 When you come near the border of the children of Ammon [Tribal people], don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon [Tribal people] for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot [Veil, Covering] for a possession.”
DEU 2:20 (That also is considered a land of Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one]: Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one] lived there before; but the Ammonites [Tribal people] call them Zamzummim,
DEU 2:21 a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Adonai destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place;
DEU 2:22 as he did for the children of Esau [Hairy], who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:
DEU 2:23 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.)
DEU 2:24 “Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
DEU 2:25 Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall sh'ma ·hear obey· the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.”
DEU 2:26 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
DEU 2:27 “Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.
DEU 2:28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet,
DEU 2:29 as the children of Esau [Hairy] who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites [Descendants of From father] who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I pass over the Jordan [Descender] into the land which Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] gives us.”
DEU 2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Adonai your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today. (6)
DEU 2:31 Adonai said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.”
DEU 2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.
DEU 2:33 Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.
DEU 2:34 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining.
DEU 2:35 Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken.
DEU 2:36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] delivered up all before us.
DEU 2:37 Only to the land of the children of Ammon [Tribal people] you didn’t come near; all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] forbade us by his enjoined words.
DEU 3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
DEU 3:2 Adonai said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people, and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], who lived at Heshbon.”
DEU 3:3 So Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining.
DEU 3:4 We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
DEU 3:5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides a great many villages without walls.
DEU 3:6 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.
DEU 3:7 But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.
DEU 3:8 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers] who were beyond the Jordan [Descender], from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon [Devoted to destruction].
DEU 3:9 (The Sidonians call Hermon [Devoted to destruction] Sirion, and the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers] call it Senir.)
DEU 3:10 We took all the 'Ieyr HaKikar [Cities of the Round], and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
DEU 3:11 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one]. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Is not it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon [Tribal people]? Nine cubits [13.5 ft; 41.15 m] was its length, and four cubits [6 ft; 18.29 m] its width, after the cubit [18 in; 45.72 cm] of a man.)
DEU 3:12 This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:
DEU 3:13 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh [Causing to forget]; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one].
DEU 3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh [Causing to forget] took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.) (7)
DEU 3:15 I gave Gilead to Machir.
DEU 3:16 To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon [Tribal people];
DEU 3:17 the Arabah also, and the Jordan [Descender] and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
DEU 3:18 I enjoined you at that time, saying, “Adonai your God has given you this land to possess it. You shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel [God prevails], all the men of valor.
DEU 3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 3:20 until Adonai gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Adonai your God gives them beyond the Jordan [Descender]. Then you shall each teshuvah ·completely return· to his own possession, which I have given you.”
DEU 3:21 I enjoined Joshua [Yah Salvation] at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Adonai your God has done to these two kings. So shall Adonai do to all the kingdoms where you go over.
DEU 3:22 You shall not fear them; for Adonai your God himself fights for you.”
DEU 3:23 I begged Adonai at that time, saying,
DEU 3:24 “'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what deity is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours?
DEU 3:25 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan [Descender], that fine mountain, and Lebanon.”
DEU 3:26 But Adonai was angry with me for your sakes, and didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· me. Adonai said to me, “Let this satisfy you. Speak no more to me of this matter.
DEU 3:27 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan [Descender].
DEU 3:28 But enjoin Joshua [Yah Salvation], and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.”
DEU 3:29 So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
DEU 4:1 Now, Israel [God prevails], sh'ma ·hear obey· the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Adonai, the God of your fathers, gives you.
DEU 4:2 You shall not add to the word which I enjoin you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the mitzvot ·instructions· of Adonai your God which I enjoin you.
DEU 4:3 Your eyes have seen what Adonai did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed Baal Peor, Adonai your God has destroyed them from among you.
DEU 4:4 But you who were faithful to Adonai your God are all alive today. (2)
DEU 4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as Adonai my God enjoined me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in to possess it.
DEU 4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall sh'ma ·hear obey· all these statutes, and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”
DEU 4:7 For what great nation is there, that has a deity so near to them, as Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] is whenever we call on him?
DEU 4:8 What great nation is there, that has statutes and judgement so upright as all this Torah ·Teaching·, which I set before you today?
DEU 4:9 Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children;
DEU 4:10 the day that you stood before Adonai your God in Horeb [Desert], when Adonai said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them sh'ma ·hear obey· my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.”
DEU 4:11 You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
DEU 4:12 Adonai spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you sh'ma ·hear obey· the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.
DEU 4:13 He declared to you his covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, which he enjoined you to perform, even the Ten Words. He wrote them on two stone tablets.
DEU 4:14 Adonai enjoined me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.
DEU 4:15 Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Adonai spoke to you in Horeb [Desert] out of the middle of the fire,
DEU 4:16 lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
DEU 4:17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
DEU 4:18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
DEU 4:19 and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and abad ·serve· them, which Adonai your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.
DEU 4:20 But Adonai has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today.
DEU 4:21 Furthermore Adonai was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan [Descender], and that I should not go in to that good land, which Adonai your God gives you for an inheritance;
DEU 4:22 but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan [Descender]; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.
DEU 4:23 Be careful, lest you forget the covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of Adonai your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves an engraved image in the form of anything which Adonai your God has enjoined forbidden for you.
DEU 4:24 For Yahweh [He sustains breathing] your God is 'Akal 'Esh [Consuming Fire], El Kana' [Jealous God].
DEU 4:25 When you shall father children, and children’s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in Adonai your God’s sight, to provoke him to anger;
DEU 4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan [Descender] to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.
DEU 4:27 Adonai will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations, where Adonai will lead you away.
DEU 4:28 There you shall abad ·serve· deities, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor sh'ma ·hear obey·, nor eat, nor smell.
DEU 4:29 But from there you shall seek Adonai your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.
DEU 4:30 When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall teshuvah ·completely return· to Adonai your God, and sh'ma ·hear obey· to his voice.
DEU 4:31 For Adonai your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of your fathers which he swore to them.
DEU 4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as this great thing is, or has been sh'ma ·heard obeyed· like it?
DEU 4:33 Did a people ever sh'ma ·hear obey· the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, and live?
DEU 4:34 Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Adonai your God did for you in Egypt [Abode of slavery] before your eyes?
DEU 4:35 It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh [He sustains breathing] is God. There is no one else besides him,
DEU 4:36 Out of heaven he made you to sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you sh'ma ·heard obeyed· his words out of the middle of the fire.
DEU 4:37 Because he 'ahav ·affectionately loved· your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt [Abode of slavery];
DEU 4:38 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today.
DEU 4:39 Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh [He sustains breathing] himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else.
DEU 4:40 You shall keep his statutes, and his mitzvot ·instructions·, which I enjoin you today, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Adonai your God gives you, forever. (A:3)
DEU 4:41 Then Moses [Drawn out] set apart three cities beyond the Jordan [Descender] toward the sunrise;
DEU 4:42 that the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
DEU 4:43 Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
DEU 4:44 This is the Torah ·Teaching· which Moses [Drawn out] set before the children of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 4:45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses [Drawn out] spoke to the children of Israel [God prevails], when they came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery],
DEU 4:46 beyond the Jordan [Descender], in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses [Drawn out] and the children of Israel [God prevails] struck, when they came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
DEU 4:47 They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], who were beyond the Jordan [Descender] toward the sunrise;
DEU 4:48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (also called Hermon [Devoted to destruction]),
DEU 4:49 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan [Descender] eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU 5:1 Moses [Drawn out] called to all Israel [God prevails], and said to them, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Israel [God prevails], the statutes and the judgments which I speak in your ears today, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.”
DEU 5:2 Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] made a covenant with us in Horeb [Desert].
DEU 5:3 Adonai didn’t make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive today.
DEU 5:4 Adonai spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the middle of the fire,
DEU 5:5 (I stood between Adonai and you at that time, to show you Adonai’s word; for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn’t go up onto the mountain) saying,
DEU 5:6 “I am Yahweh [He sustains breathing] your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], out of the house of bondage.
DEU 5:7 “You shall have no other deities before me.
DEU 5:8 “You shall not make an engraved image for yourself, any likeness of what is in heaven above, or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
DEU 5:9 You shall not hawa ·bow low, prostrate· yourself down to them, nor abad ·serve· them; for I, Yahweh [He sustains breathing], your God, am El Kana' [Jealous God], visiting the depravity (moral evil) of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me;
DEU 5:10 and showing chesed ·loving-kindness· to thousands of those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· me and keep my mitzvot ·instructions·.
DEU 5:11 “You shall not use את the name of Adonai your God worthlessly: for Adonai את will not hold him guiltless who takes את his name in vain.
DEU 5:12 “Observe the Shabath ·Intermission· day, to keep it holy, as Adonai your God enjoined you.
DEU 5:13 You shall labor six days, and do all your work;
DEU 5:14 but the seventh day is a Shabath ·Intermission· to Adonai your God, in which you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
DEU 5:15 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and Adonai your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. Therefore Adonai your God enjoined you to keep the Shabath ·Intermission· day.
DEU 5:16 “Honor your father and your mother, as Adonai your God enjoined you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Adonai your God gives you.
DEU 5:17 “You shall not murder.
DEU 5:18 “You shall not commit adultery.
DEU 5:19 “You shall not steal.
DEU 5:20 “You shall not give false witness against your neighbor.
DEU 5:21 “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. Neither shall you desire your neighbor’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your wrote neighbor’s.” (A:5, S:4)
DEU 5:22 Adonai spoke these words to all your assembly on the mountain out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice. He added no more. He them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me.
DEU 5:23 When you sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
DEU 5:24 and you said, “Behold, Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] has shown us his kavod ·weighty glory· and his greatness, and we have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· his voice out of the middle of the fire. We have seen today that God does speak with man, and he lives.
DEU 5:25 Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we sh'ma ·hear obey· Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God]’s voice any more, then we shall die.
DEU 5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of the Elohim Chayim [Living God] speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived?
DEU 5:27 Go near, and sh'ma ·hear obey· all that Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] shall say, and tell us all that Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] tells you; and we will sh'ma ·hear obey· it, and do it.”
DEU 5:28 Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and Adonai said to me, “I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They have well said all that they have spoken.
DEU 5:29 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my mitzvot ·instructions· always, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!
DEU 5:30 “Go tell them, ‘Teshuvah ·Completely return· to your tents.’
DEU 5:31 But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the mitzvot ·instructions·, and the statutes, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.”
DEU 5:32 You shall observe to do therefore as Adonai your God has enjoined you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
DEU 5:33 You shall walk in all the way which Adonai your God has enjoined you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
DEU 6:1 Now this is the mitzvot ·instructions·, the statutes, and the judgments, which Adonai your God enjoined to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it;
DEU 6:2 that you might fear Adonai your God, to keep all his statutes and his mitzvot ·instructions·, which I enjoin you; you, and your son, and your son’s son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.
DEU 6:3 Sh'ma ·Hear understand obey· therefore, Israel [God prevails], and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Adonai, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. (A:6, S:5)
DEU 6:4 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Israel [God prevails]: Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is echad ·one, one unity·.
DEU 6:5 You shall את 'ahav ·affectionately love· Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.
DEU 6:6 These words, which I enjoin you today, shall be on your heart;
DEU 6:7 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
DEU 6:8 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
DEU 6:9 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates. (S:6)
DEU 6:10 It shall be, when Adonai your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter], to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn’t build,
DEU 6:11 and houses full of all good things, which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn’t plant, and you shall eat and be full;
DEU 6:12 then beware lest you forget Adonai, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], out of the house of bondage.
DEU 6:13 You shall fear Adonai your God; and you shall abad ·serve· him, and shall swear by his name.
DEU 6:14 You shall not go after other deities, of the deities of the peoples who are around you;
DEU 6:15 for Adonai your God among you is El Kana' [Jealous God]; lest the anger of Adonai your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.
DEU 6:16 You shall not tempt Adonai your God, as you tempted him in Massah [Testing].
DEU 6:17 You shall diligently keep the mitzvot ·instructions· of Adonai your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has enjoined you.
DEU 6:18 You shall do that which is right and good in Adonai’s sight; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which Adonai swore to your fathers,
DEU 6:19 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Adonai has spoken.
DEU 6:20 Some day when your child asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments, which Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God] has enjoined you mean?”
DEU 6:21 then you shall tell your child, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Adonai brought us out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] with a mighty hand;
DEU 6:22 and Adonai showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt [Abode of slavery], on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
DEU 6:23 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
DEU 6:24 Adonai enjoined us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God], for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as we are today.
DEU 6:25 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this mitzvot ·instructions· before Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God], as he has enjoined us.”
DEU 7:1 When Adonai your God brings you into the land where you go to possess it, and casts out many nations before you, the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], the Girgashite, the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], the Perizzite [Descendant of Belonging to village], the Hivite [Wicked], and the Jebusite [Descendants of Thresher], seven nations greater and mightier than you;
DEU 7:2 and when Adonai your God delivers them up before you, and you strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;
DEU 7:3 neither shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son.
DEU 7:4 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may abad ·serve· other deities. So Adonai’s anger would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.
DEU 7:5 But you shall deal with them like this. You shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, and cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire.
DEU 7:6 For you are a holy people to Adonai your God. Adonai your God has chosen you to be a le'am segulah ·people of special treasure· for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
DEU 7:7 Adonai didn’t set his chasak ·to set one’s affection, to make bands· on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples:
DEU 7:8 but because Adonai loves you, and because he desires to keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, Adonai has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 7:9 Know therefore that Adonai your God himself is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and chesed ·loving-kindness· with them who 'ahav ·affectionately love· him and keep his mitzvot ·instructions· to a thousand generations,
DEU 7:10 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.
DEU 7:11 You shall therefore keep the mitzvot ·instructions·, the statutes, and the judgments, which I enjoin you today, to do them.
DEU 7:12 It shall happen, because you sh'ma ·hear obey· these judgments, and keep and do them, that Adonai your God will keep with you the covenant and the chesed ·loving-kindness· which he swore to your fathers.
DEU 7:13 He will 'ahav ·affectionately love· you, bless you, multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.
DEU 7:14 You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.
DEU 7:15 Adonai will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt [Abode of slavery], which you know, will he put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.
DEU 7:16 You shall consume all the peoples whom Adonai your God shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you abad ·serve· their deities; for that would be a snare to you.
DEU 7:17 If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?”
DEU 7:18 you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what Adonai your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt [Abode of slavery];
DEU 7:19 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Adonai your God brought you out. So shall Adonai your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
DEU 7:20 Moreover Adonai your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.
DEU 7:21 You shall not be scared of them; for Adonai your God is among you, a great and awesome God.
DEU 7:22 Adonai your God will cast out those nations before you little by little. You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.
DEU 7:23 But Adonai your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed.
DEU 7:24 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.
DEU 7:25 You shall burn the engraved images of their deities with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Adonai your God.
DEU 7:26 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
DEU 8:1 You shall observe to do all the mitzvot ·instructions· which I enjoin you today, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Adonai swore to your fathers.
DEU 8:2 You shall remember all the way which Adonai your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his mitzvot ·instructions·, or not.
DEU 8:3 He humbled you, and allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna ·what is it·, which you didn’t know, neither did your fathers know; that he might teach you that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every d'var ·word· that proceeds out of Adonai’s mouth.
DEU 8:4 Your clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.
DEU 8:5 You shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Adonai your God disciplines you.
DEU 8:6 You shall keep the mitzvot ·instructions· of Adonai your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
DEU 8:7 For Adonai your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills;
DEU 8:8 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;
DEU 8:9 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.
DEU 8:10 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Adonai your God for the good land which he has given you. (2)
DEU 8:11 Beware lest you forget Adonai your God, in not keeping his mitzvot ·instructions·, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I enjoin you today;
DEU 8:12 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built fine houses, and lived in them;
DEU 8:13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
DEU 8:14 then your heart might be lifted up, and you forget Adonai your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], out of the house of bondage;
DEU 8:15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who poured water for you out of the rock of flint;
DEU 8:16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna ·what is it·, which your fathers didn’t know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end:
DEU 8:17 and lest you say in your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.”
DEU 8:18 But you shall remember Adonai your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· which he swore to your fathers, as it is today.
DEU 8:19 It shall be, if you shall forget Adonai your God, and walk after other deities, and abad ·serve· them, and hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship them, I testify against you today that you shall surely perish.
DEU 8:20 As the nations that Adonai makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you wouldn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice.
DEU 9:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Israel [God prevails]! You are to pass over the Jordan [Descender] today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,
DEU 9:2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it said, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?”
DEU 9:3 Know therefore today, that Adonai your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out, and make them perish quickly, as Adonai has spoken to you. (3)
DEU 9:4 Don’t say in your heart, after Adonai your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, “For my righteousness Adonai has brought me in to possess this land;” because Adonai drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.
DEU 9:5 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Adonai your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Adonai swore to your fathers, to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter].
DEU 9:6 Know therefore, that Adonai your God does not give you this good land to possess for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.
DEU 9:7 Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Adonai your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Adonai.
DEU 9:8 Also in Horeb [Desert] you provoked Adonai to wrath, and Adonai was angry with you to destroy you.
DEU 9:9 When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Adonai made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.
DEU 9:10 Adonai delivered to me the two stone tablets written with God’s finger. On them were all the words which Adonai spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.
DEU 9:11 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Adonai gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant.
DEU 9:12 Adonai said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside out of the way which I enjoined them. They have made a molten image for themselves!”
DEU 9:13 Furthermore Adonai spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
DEU 9:14 Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”
DEU 9:15 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
DEU 9:16 I looked, and behold, you had sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· against Adonai your God. You had made yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly out of the way which Adonai had enjoined you.
DEU 9:17 I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
DEU 9:18 I fell down before Adonai, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your habitual sins ·missing the marks· which you sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·, in doing that which was evil in Adonai’s sight, to provoke him to anger.
DEU 9:19 I was terrified that because of how angry Adonai was at you, of how heatedly displeased he was, that he would destroy you. But Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· me that time too.
DEU 9:20 Adonai was angry enough with Aaron [Light-bringer] to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron [Light-bringer] also at the same time.
DEU 9:21 I took your habitual sin ·missing the mark·, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.
DEU 9:22 At Taberah, and at Massah [Testing], and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Adonai to wrath.
DEU 9:23 When Adonai sent you from Kadesh Barnea [Consecrated Son-inconstant], saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the order of Adonai your God, and you didn’t trust him, nor sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice.
DEU 9:24 You have been rebellious against Adonai from the day that I knew you.
DEU 9:25 So I fell down before Adonai the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Adonai had said he would destroy you.
DEU 9:26 I prayed to Adonai, and said, “'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], don’t destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] with a mighty hand.
DEU 9:27 Remember your servants, Abraham [Father of a multitude], Isaac [Laughter], and Jacob [Supplanter]. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their ethical wickedness, nor at their habitual sin ·missing the mark·,
DEU 9:28 lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Adonai was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’
DEU 9:29 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”
DEU 10:1 At that time Adonai said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.
DEU 10:2 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.”
DEU 10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand.
DEU 10:4 He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the Ten Words, which Adonai spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Adonai gave them to me.
DEU 10:5 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Adonai enjoined me.
DEU 10:6 (The children of Israel [God prevails] traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron [Light-bringer] died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar [Help of God] his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place.
DEU 10:7 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
DEU 10:8 At that time Adonai set apart the tribe of Levi [United with], to bear the ark of Adonai’s covenant, to stand before Adonai to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
DEU 10:9 Therefore Levi [United with] has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Adonai is his inheritance, according as Adonai your God spoke to him.)
DEU 10:10 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· me that time also; Adonai would not destroy you.
DEU 10:11 Adonai said to me, “Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.” (5)
DEU 10:12 Now, Israel [God prevails], what does Adonai your God require of you, but to fear Adonai your God, to walk in all his ways, and to 'ahav ·affectionately love· him, and to abad ·serve· Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
DEU 10:13 to keep Adonai’s mitzvot ·instructions· and statutes, which I enjoin you today for your good?
DEU 10:14 Behold, to Adonai your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
DEU 10:15 Only Adonai had chasak ·to set one’s affection· for your fathers to 'ahav ·affectionately love· them, and he chose their offspring after them, even you above all peoples, as it is today.
DEU 10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
DEU 10:17 For Adonai your God, he is Elohei of the elohim ·God of the deities·, and the 'Adonei of the adoneim ·the Lord of the lords·, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who does not respect persons, nor takes reward.
DEU 10:18 He does execute right judgments for the orphan and widow, and 'ahav ·affectionately loves· the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.
DEU 10:19 Therefore 'ahav ·affectionately love· the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
DEU 10:20 You shall fear Adonai your God; you shall abad ·serve· him; and you shall dabak ·cling to, worship· him, and you shall swear by his name.
DEU 10:21 He is your tehilah ·praise song·, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.
DEU 10:22 Your fathers went down into Egypt [Abode of slavery] with seventy persons; and now Adonai your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.
DEU 11:1 Therefore you shall 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God, and keep his instructions, his statutes, his judgments, and his mitzvot ·instructions·, always.
DEU 11:2 Know this day: for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Adonai your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm,
DEU 11:3 his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to Pharaoh the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and to all his land;
DEU 11:4 and what he did to the army of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea] to overflow them as they pursued you, and how Adonai has destroyed them to this day;
DEU 11:5 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;
DEU 11:6 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben [See, a son!]; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel [God prevails];
DEU 11:7 but your eyes have seen all of Adonai’s great work which he did.
DEU 11:8 Therefore you shall keep every mitzvah ·instruction· which I enjoin you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it;
DEU 11:9 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Adonai swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey. (6)
DEU 11:10 For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], that you came out of, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
DEU 11:11 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water from the rain of the sky,
DEU 11:12 a land which Adonai your God cares for. Adonai your God’s eyes are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
DEU 11:13 It shall happen, if you shall sh'ma ·hear obey· diligently to my mitzvot ·instructions· which I enjoin you today, to 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God, and to abad ·serve· him with all your heart and with all your soul,
DEU 11:14 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.
DEU 11:15 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
DEU 11:16 Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and abad ·serve· other deities, and hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship them;
DEU 11:17 and Adonai’s anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that there is no rain, and the land does not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Adonai gives you.
DEU 11:18 Therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
DEU 11:19 You shall teach them your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
DEU 11:20 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates;
DEU 11:21 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Adonai swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth. (7 and Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 11:22 For if you shall diligently keep all these mitzvot ·instructions· which I enjoin you, to do them, to 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God, to walk in all his ways, and to dabak ·cling to, worship· to him;
DEU 11:23 then will Adonai drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
DEU 11:24 Every place whereon the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates [Fruitful], even to the western sea shall be your border.
DEU 11:25 No man will be able to stand before you. Adonai your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you tread on, as he has spoken to you.
DEU 11:26 Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:
DEU 11:27 the blessing, if you sh'ma ·hear obey· the mitzvot ·instructions· of Adonai your God, which I enjoin you today;
DEU 11:28 and the curse, if you do not sh'ma ·hear obey· the mitzvot ·instructions· of Adonai your God, but turn aside out of the way which I enjoin you today, to go after other deities, which you have not known.
DEU 11:29 It shall happen, when Adonai your God brings you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
DEU 11:30 Are not they beyond the Jordan [Descender], behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites [Descendants of Humbled] who dwell in the Arabah, near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
DEU 11:31 For you are to pass over the Jordan [Descender] to go in to possess the land which Adonai your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.
DEU 11:32 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the judgments which I set before you today.
DEU 12:1 These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall observe to do in the land which Adonai, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.
DEU 12:2 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess abad ·served· their deities, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
DEU 12:3 You shall break down their altars, and dash their pillars in pieces, and burn their Asherah poles with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images of their deities. You shall destroy their name out of that place.
DEU 12:4 You shall not do so to Adonai your God.
DEU 12:5 But to the place which Adonai your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, you shall seek his habitation, and there you shall come.
DEU 12:6 There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.
DEU 12:7 There you shall eat before Adonai your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which Adonai your God has blessed you.
DEU 12:8 You shall not do after all the things that we do here today, every man whatever is right in his own eyes;
DEU 12:9 for you haven’t yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Adonai your God gives you.
DEU 12:10 But when you go over the Jordan [Descender], and dwell in the land which Adonai your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety; (2)
DEU 12:11 then it shall happen that to the place which Adonai your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I enjoin you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Adonai.
DEU 12:12 You shall rejoice before Adonai your God, you, and your sons, your daughters, your male servants, your female servants, and the Levite [Descendant of United with] who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
DEU 12:13 Be careful that you don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;
DEU 12:14 but in the place which Adonai chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I enjoin you.
DEU 12:15 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat meat within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to Adonai your God’s blessing which he has given you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the deer.
DEU 12:16 Only you shall not eat the blood. You shall pour it out on the earth like water.
DEU 12:17 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your free will offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
DEU 12:18 but you shall eat them before Adonai your God in the place which Adonai your God shall choose, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, and the Levite [Descendant of United with] who is within your gates. You shall rejoice before Adonai your God in all that you put your hand to.
DEU 12:19 Be careful that you don’t forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
DEU 12:20 When Adonai your God enlarges your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, “I want to eat meat,” because your soul desires to eat meat; you may eat meat, after all the desire of your soul.
DEU 12:21 If the place which Adonai your God shall choose, to put his name there, is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Adonai has given you, as I have enjoined you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul.
DEU 12:22 Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so you shall eat of it. The unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.
DEU 12:23 Only be sure that you don’t eat the blood; for the blood is the life. You shall not eat the life with the meat.
DEU 12:24 You shall not eat it. You shall pour it out on the earth like water.
DEU 12:25 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in Adonai’s eyes.
DEU 12:26 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which Adonai shall choose.
DEU 12:27 You shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on Adonai your God’s altar; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on Adonai your God’s altar; and you shall eat the meat.
DEU 12:28 Observe and sh'ma ·hear obey· all these words which I enjoin you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in Adonai your God’s eyes. (3)
DEU 12:29 When Adonai your God cuts off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land;
DEU 12:30 be careful that you are not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you not inquire after their deities, saying, “How do these nations abad ·serve· their deities? I will do likewise.”
DEU 12:31 You shall not do so to Adonai your God; for every abomination to Adonai, which he hates, have they done to their deities; for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their deities.
DEU 12:32 Whatever thing I enjoin you, that you shall observe to do. You shall not add to it, nor take away from it.
DEU 13:1 If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,
DEU 13:2 and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, “Let us go after other deities” (which you have not known) “and let us abad ·serve· them;”
DEU 13:3 you shall not sh'ma ·hear obey· the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams; for Adonai your God is testing you, to know whether you 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
DEU 13:4 You shall walk after Adonai your God, fear him, keep his mitzvot ·instructions·, and sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice, and you shall abad ·serve· him, and dabak ·cling to, worship· him.
DEU 13:5 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against Adonai your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which Adonai your God enjoined you to walk in. So you shall remove the evil from among you.
DEU 13:6 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, “Let us go and abad ·serve· other deities,” which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;
DEU 13:7 of the deities of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
DEU 13:8 you shall not consent to him, nor sh'ma ·hear obey· him; you must not pity him or spare him, neither shall you conceal him;
DEU 13:9 but you shall surely kill him! Your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people.
DEU 13:10 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from Adonai your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], out of the house of bondage.
DEU 13:11 All Israel [God prevails] shall sh'ma ·hear obey·, and fear, and shall not do any more wickedness like this among you.
DEU 13:12 If you shall sh'ma ·hear obey· about one of your cities, which Adonai your God gives you to dwell there, that
DEU 13:13 certain base fellows have gone out from among you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, “Let us go and abad ·serve· other deities,” which you have not known;
DEU 13:14 then you shall inquire, and make search, and ask diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such detestable things are being done among you,
DEU 13:15 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, with all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the sword.
DEU 13:16 You shall gather all its plunder into the middle of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, and all every bit of its plunder, to Adonai your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again.
DEU 13:17 Nothing of the devoted thing shall dabak ·cling to, worship· your hand, that Adonai may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you rachamim ·merciful loves·, and have racham ·compassionate love· on you, and multiply you, as he has sworn to your fathers;
DEU 13:18 when you sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, to keep all his mitzvot ·instructions· which I am enjoining to you today, to do that which is right in Adonai your God’s eyes.
DEU 14:1 You are the children of Adonai your God. You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
DEU 14:2 For you are a holy people to Adonai your God, and Adonai has chosen you to be le'am segulah ·people of special treasure· for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
DEU 14:3 You shall not eat any abominable thing.
DEU 14:4 These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
DEU 14:5 the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the chamois.
DEU 14:6 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.
DEU 14:7 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof cloven: the camel, the hare, and the rabbit. Because they chew the cud but don’t part the hoof, they are unclean to you.
DEU 14:8 The pig, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. You shall not eat their meat, and you shall not touch their carcasses.
DEU 14:9 These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat.
DEU 14:10 You shall not eat whatever does not have fins and scales. It is unclean to you.
DEU 14:11 Of all clean birds you may eat.
DEU 14:12 But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,
DEU 14:13 the red kite, the falcon, the kite after its kind,
DEU 14:14 every raven after its kind,
DEU 14:15 the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the hawk after its kind,
DEU 14:16 the little owl, the great owl, the horned owl,
DEU 14:17 the pelican, the vulture, the cormorant,
DEU 14:18 the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
DEU 14:19 All winged creeping things are unclean to you. They shall not be eaten.
DEU 14:20 Of all clean birds you may eat.
DEU 14:21 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself. You may give it to the foreigner living among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people to Adonai your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk. (5)
DEU 14:22 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes out of the field year by year.
DEU 14:23 You shall eat before Adonai your God, in the place which he chooses, to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to fear Adonai your God always.
DEU 14:24 If the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from you, which Adonai your God shall choose, to set his name there, when Adonai your God shall bless you;
DEU 14:25 then you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which Adonai your God shall choose.
DEU 14:26 You shall trade the money for whatever your soul desires, for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat there before Adonai your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household.
DEU 14:27 You shall not forsake the Levite [Descendant of United with] who is within your gates, for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
DEU 14:28 At the end of every three years you shall bring all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall store it within your gates.
DEU 14:29 The Levite [Descendant of United with], because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the foreigner living among you, and the orphan, and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Adonai your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
DEU 15:1 At the end of every seven years, you shall cancel debts.
DEU 15:2 This is the way it shall be done: every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not require payment from his neighbor and his brother; because Adonai’s release has been proclaimed.
DEU 15:3 Of a foreigner you may require it; but whatever of yours is with your brother, your hand shall release.
DEU 15:4 However there shall be no poor with you (for Adonai will surely bless you in the land which Adonai your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it)
DEU 15:5 if only you sh'ma ·hear obey· sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, to observe to do all this mitzvot ·instructions· which I am enjoining to you today.
DEU 15:6 For Adonai your God will bless you, as he promised you. You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow. You will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
DEU 15:7 If a poor man, one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land which Adonai your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother;
DEU 15:8 but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, which he lacks.
DEU 15:9 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying, “The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand;” and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cry to Adonai against you, and it be crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· to you.
DEU 15:10 You shall surely give, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him; because that for this thing Adonai your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand to.
DEU 15:11 For the poor will never cease out of the land. Therefore I enjoin you to surely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.
DEU 15:12 If your brother, a Hebrew [Immigrant] man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, and serves you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.
DEU 15:13 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty.
DEU 15:14 You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your wine press. As Adonai your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
DEU 15:15 You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and Adonai your God redeemed you. Therefore I enjoin you this thing today.
DEU 15:16 It shall be, if he tells you, “I will not go out from you,” because he 'ahav ·affectionately loves· you and your house, because he is well with you;
DEU 15:17 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.
DEU 15:18 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for he has been double value of a hired hand as he served you six years. Adonai your God will bless you in all that you do. (7)
DEU 15:19 You shall dedicate all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock to Adonai your God. You shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
DEU 15:20 You shall eat it before Adonai your God year by year in the place which Adonai shall choose, you and your household.
DEU 15:21 If it has any defect, is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Adonai your God.
DEU 15:22 You shall eat it within your gates. The unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the deer.
DEU 15:23 Only you shall not eat its blood. You shall pour it out on the ground like water.
DEU 16:1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Pesac ·Passover· to Adonai your God; for in the month of Abib Adonai your God brought you out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] by night.
DEU 16:2 You shall sacrifice the Pesac ·Passover· to Adonai your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Adonai shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
DEU 16:3 You shall eat no leavened bread with it. You shall eat matzah ·unleavened bread· with it seven days, even the bread of affliction; for you came out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] in haste; that you may remember the day when you came out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] all the days of your life.
DEU 16:4 No yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the meat, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning.
DEU 16:5 You may not sacrifice the Pesac ·Passover· within any of your gates, which Adonai your God gives you;
DEU 16:6 but at the place which Adonai your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Pesac ·Passover· at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
DEU 16:7 You shall roast and eat it in the place which Adonai your God chooses. In the morning you shall teshuvah ·completely return· to your tents.
DEU 16:8 Six days you shall eat matzah ·unleavened bread·. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Adonai your God. You shall do no work.
DEU 16:9 You shall count for yourselves seven weeks. From the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to count seven weeks.
DEU 16:10 You shall keep the festival of Shavu'ot ·Weeks· / Pentacost ·Fifty· to Adonai your God with a tribute of a free will offering of your hand, which you shall give, according as Adonai your God blesses you.
DEU 16:11 You shall rejoice before Adonai your God: you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite [Descendant of United with] who is within your gates, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, who are among you, in the place which Adonai your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
DEU 16:12 You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt [Abode of slavery]. You shall observe and do these statutes. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 16:13 You shall keep Sukkot ·Booths· seven days, after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your wine press.
DEU 16:14 You shall rejoice in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, who are within your gates.
DEU 16:15 You shall keep a feast to Adonai your God seven days in the place which Adonai chooses; because Adonai your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.
DEU 16:16 Three times in a year all of your males shall appear before Adonai your God in the place which he chooses: in the festival of Matzah ·Unleavened bread·, in the festival of Shavu'ot ·Weeks· / Pentacost ·Fifty·, and in the festival of Sukkot ·Booths·. They shall not appear before Adonai empty.
DEU 16:17 Every man shall give as he is able, according to Adonai your God’s blessing which he has given you.
DEU 16:18 You shall make judges and officers in all your gates, which Adonai your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
DEU 16:19 You shall not pervert mishpat ·justice·. You shall not show partiality. You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise, and perverts the words of the upright.
DEU 16:20 You shall follow that which is altogether just, that you may live, and inherit the land which Adonai your God gives you.
DEU 16:21 You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside Adonai your God’s altar, which you shall make for yourselves.
DEU 16:22 Neither shall you set yourself up a sacred stone which Adonai your God hates.
DEU 17:1 You shall not sacrifice to Adonai your God an ox, or a sheep, in which is a defect, or anything evil; for that is an abomination to Adonai your God.
DEU 17:2 If there is found among you, within any of your gates which Adonai your God gives you, a man or woman who does that which is evil in Adonai your God’s sight, in transgressing his covenant,
DEU 17:3 and has gone and abad ·served· other deities, and hawa ·bowed low, prostrated· in worship to them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the sky, which I have not enjoined;
DEU 17:4 and you are told, and you have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of it, then you shall inquire diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain, that such detestable things are being done in Israel [God prevails],
DEU 17:5 then you shall bring out that man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even that same man or woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones.
DEU 17:6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
DEU 17:7 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from among you.
DEU 17:8 If there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates; then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Adonai your God chooses.
DEU 17:9 You shall come to the priests who are Levites [Descendants of United with], and to the judge who shall be in those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give you the mishpat ·verdict·.
DEU 17:10 You shall do according to the decisions of the verdict which they shall give you from that place which Adonai chooses. You shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you:
DEU 17:11 according to the decisions of the Torah ·Teaching· which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.
DEU 17:12 The man who does presumptuously, in not sh'ma ·hear obey· unto the priest who stands to minister there before Adonai your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die. You shall put away the evil from Israel [God prevails].
DEU 17:13 All the people shall sh'ma ·hear obey·, and fear, and do no more presumptuously. (2)
DEU 17:14 When you have come to the land which Adonai your God gives you, and possess it, and dwell in it, and say, “I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me;”
DEU 17:15 you shall surely set him king over yourselves, whom Adonai your God chooses. You shall set as king over you one from among your brothers. You may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your brother.
DEU 17:16 Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to teshuvah ·completely return· to Egypt [Abode of slavery], to the end that he may multiply horses; because Adonai has said to you, “You shall not go back that way again.”
DEU 17:17 He shall not multiply wives to himself, that his heart not turn away. He shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
DEU 17:18 It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this Torah ·Teaching· in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites [Descendants of United with].
DEU 17:19 It shall be with him, and he shall read from it all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Adonai his God, to keep all the words of this Torah ·Teaching· and these statutes, to do them;
DEU 17:20 that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not turn aside from the mitzvah ·instruction·, to the right hand, or to the left; to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the middle of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 18:1 The priests the Levites [Descendants of United with], all the tribe of Levi [United with], shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel [God prevails]. They shall eat the offerings of Adonai made by fire and his portion.
DEU 18:2 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers. Adonai is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.
DEU 18:3 This shall be the priests’ mishpat ·due· from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the inner parts.
DEU 18:4 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the first fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
DEU 18:5 For Adonai your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in Adonai’s name, him and his sons forever. (4)
DEU 18:6 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel [God prevails], where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Adonai shall choose;
DEU 18:7 then he shall minister in the name of Adonai his God, as all his brothers the Levites [Descendants of United with] do, who stand there before Adonai.
DEU 18:8 They shall have like portions to eat, in addition to that which comes from the sale of his family possessions.
DEU 18:9 When you have come into the land which Adonai your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the abominations of those nations.
DEU 18:10 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
DEU 18:11 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a sorcerer, or a necromancer.
DEU 18:12 For whoever does these things is detestable to Adonai. Because of these abominations, Adonai your God drives them out from before you.
DEU 18:13 You shall be perfect with Adonai your God. (5)
DEU 18:14 For these nations that you shall dispossess sh'ma ·hear obey· those who practice sorcery and to diviners; but as for you, Adonai your God has not allowed you so to do.
DEU 18:15 Adonai your God will raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your brothers, like me. You shall sh'ma ·hear obey· him.
DEU 18:16 This is according to all that you desired of Adonai your God in Horeb [Desert] in the day of the assembly, saying, “Let me not sh'ma ·hear obey· again Adonai my God’s voice, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.”
DEU 18:17 Adonai said to me, “They have well said that which they have spoken.
DEU 18:18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall enjoin him.
DEU 18:19 Whoever does not honor the words of the Prophet will give an account to God. The prophet's words are equal authority to God's words. It shall happen, that whoever will not sh'ma ·hear obey· my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
DEU 18:20 But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not enjoined him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other deities, that same prophet shall die.”
DEU 18:21 You may say in your heart, “How shall we know the word which Adonai has not spoken?”
DEU 18:22 When a prophet speaks in Adonai’s name, if the thing does not follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Adonai has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.
DEU 19:1 When Adonai your God cuts off the nations, whose land Adonai your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;
DEU 19:2 you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the middle of your land, which Adonai your God gives you to possess it.
DEU 19:3 You shall prepare the way, and divide the borders of your land, which Adonai your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every man slayer may flee there.
DEU 19:4 This is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and live. Whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past;
DEU 19:5 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor, so that he dies, he shall flee to one of these cities and live.
DEU 19:6 Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the man slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally; even though he was not mishpat ·judged· worthy of death, because he didn’t hate him in time past.
DEU 19:7 Therefore I enjoin you to set apart three cities for yourselves.
DEU 19:8 If Adonai your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;
DEU 19:9 if you keep all this mitzvot ·instructions· to do them, which I enjoin you today, to 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then you shall add three cities more for yourselves, besides these three.
DEU 19:10 This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land which Adonai your God gives you for an inheritance, leaving blood guilt on you.
DEU 19:11 But if any man hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, strikes him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities;
DEU 19:12 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
DEU 19:13 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel [God prevails], that it may go well with you. (6)
DEU 19:14 You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Adonai your God gives you to possess.
DEU 19:15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any depravity (moral evil), or for any habitual sin ·missing the mark·, in any crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· that he sins ·errs (the standard goal)·. At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.
DEU 19:16 If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing,
DEU 19:17 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Adonai, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;
DEU 19:18 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;
DEU 19:19 then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from among you.
DEU 19:20 Those who remain shall sh'ma ·hear obey·, and fear, and will never again commit any such evil among you.
DEU 19:21 Your eyes shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
DEU 20:1 When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Adonai your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
DEU 20:2 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,
DEU 20:3 and shall tell them, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Israel [God prevails], you draw near today to battle against your enemies. Don’t let your heart faint! Don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;
DEU 20:4 for Adonai your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.”
DEU 20:5 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and teshuvah ·completely return· to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
DEU 20:6 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and teshuvah ·completely return· to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit.
DEU 20:7 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and teshuvah ·completely return· to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.”
DEU 20:8 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, “What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and teshuvah ·completely return· to his house, lest his brother’s heart melt as his heart.”
DEU 20:9 It shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people. (7)
DEU 20:10 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.
DEU 20:11 It shall be, if it makes you answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you.
DEU 20:12 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it.
DEU 20:13 When Adonai your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword;
DEU 20:14 but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder, you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may use the plunder of your enemies, which Adonai your God has given you.
DEU 20:15 Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
DEU 20:16 But of the cities of these peoples, that Adonai your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;
DEU 20:17 but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite [Descendant of Trembling fear], the Amorite [Descendants of Talkers], the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled], the Perizzite [Descendant of Belonging to village], the Hivite [Wicked], and the Jebusite [Descendants of Thresher]; as Adonai your God has enjoined you;
DEU 20:18 that they not teach you to follow all their abominations, which they have done to their deities; so would you sin ·err (from the standard goal)· against Adonai your God.
DEU 20:19 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged by you?
DEU 20:20 Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.
DEU 21:1 If someone is found slain in the land which Adonai your God gives you to possess, lying in the field, and it is not known who has struck him;
DEU 21:2 then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is slain.
DEU 21:3 It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke.
DEU 21:4 The leaders of that town are to bring the heifer down to a valley with a stream in it that never dries up, to a place that is neither plowed nor sown; and they are to break the cow’s neck there in the valley
DEU 21:5 The priests the sons of Levi [United with] shall come near; for them Adonai your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in Adonai’s name; and according to their word shall every controversy and every assault be decided.
DEU 21:6 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 21:7 They shall answer and say, “Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
DEU 21:8 Forgive, Adonai, your people Israel [God prevails], whom you have redeemed, and don’t allow innocent blood among your people Israel [God prevails].” The blood shall be forgiven them.
DEU 21:9 So you shall put away the innocent blood from among you, when you shall do that which is right in Adonai’s eyes.
DEU 21:10 When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Adonai your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive,
DEU 21:11 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have chasak ·set your affection· for her, and desire to take her as your wife;
DEU 21:12 then you shall bring her home to your house. She shall shave her head and trim her nails.
DEU 21:13 She shall take the clothing of her captivity off of herself, and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month. After that you shall go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
DEU 21:14 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.
DEU 21:15 If a man has two wives, the one 'ahav ·affectionately loved·, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the 'ahav ·affectionately loved· and the hated; and if the firstborn son is hers who was hated;
DEU 21:16 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the son of the 'ahav ·affectionately loved· the rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn;
DEU 21:17 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength. The mishpat ·right· of the firstborn is his.
DEU 21:18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not sh'ma ·hear obey· the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them;
DEU 21:19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place.
DEU 21:20 They shall tell the elders of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious. He will not sh'ma ·hear obey· our voice. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”
DEU 21:21 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from among you. All Israel [God prevails] shall sh'ma ·hear obey·, and fear. (2)
DEU 21:22 If a man has committed a crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· mishpat ·judged· worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree;
DEU 21:23 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don’t defile your land which Adonai your God gives you for an inheritance.
DEU 22:1 You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely bring them again to your brother.
DEU 22:2 If your brother is not near to you, or if you don’t know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother comes looking for it, and you shall restore it to him.
DEU 22:3 So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s which he has lost. If you find something of your brother’s that he has lost, you must not ignore it.
DEU 22:4 You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely help him to lift them up again.
DEU 22:5 A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is detestable to Adonai your God.
DEU 22:6 If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.
DEU 22:7 You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days. (3)
DEU 22:8 When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there.
DEU 22:9 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.
DEU 22:10 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
DEU 22:11 You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
DEU 22:12 You shall make yourselves fringes on the four corners of your cloak with which you cover yourself.
DEU 22:13 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, hates her,
DEU 22:14 accuses her of shameful things, and gives her a bad name, and says, “I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of virginity;”
DEU 22:15 then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.
DEU 22:16 The young lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, and he hates her.
DEU 22:17 Behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, ‘I didn’t find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;’ and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
DEU 22:18 The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him.
DEU 22:19 They shall fine him one hundred shekels [2.5 lb; 1.13 kg] of silver, and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has given a bad name to a virgin of Israel [God prevails]. She shall be his wife. He may not divorce her all his days.
DEU 22:20 But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity was not found in the young lady;
DEU 22:21 then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel [God prevails], to play the prostitute in her father’s house. So you shall remove the evil from among you.
DEU 22:22 If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both die, the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you shall remove the evil from Israel [God prevails].
DEU 22:23 If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man finds her in the city, and lies with her;
DEU 22:24 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn’t cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor’s wife. So you shall remove the evil from among you.
DEU 22:25 But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her, and lies with her; then only the man who lay with her shall die;
DEU 22:26 but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter;
DEU 22:27 for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her.
DEU 22:28 If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her, and lies with her, and they are found;
DEU 22:29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels [1.25 lb; 0.57 kg] of silver. She shall be his wife, because he has humbled her. He may not divorce her all his days.
DEU 22:30 A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.
DEU 23:1 He who is emasculated by crushed or damaged private parts shall not enter into Adonai’s assembly.
DEU 23:2 A person born of a forbidden union shall not enter into Adonai’s assembly; even to the tenth generation shall no one of his enter into Adonai’s assembly.
DEU 23:3 An Ammonite [Tribal people] or a Moabite [From father] shall not enter into Adonai’s assembly; even to the tenth generation shall no one belonging to them enter into Adonai’s assembly forever;
DEU 23:4 because they didn’t meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and because they hired against you Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people] the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
DEU 23:5 Nevertheless Adonai your God would not sh'ma ·hear obey· Balaam [Not people, Destroyer of people]; but Adonai your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Adonai your God 'ahav ·affectionately loved· you.
DEU 23:6 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever. (4)
DEU 23:7 You shall not abhor an Edomite [Red]; for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery], because you lived as a foreigner in his land.
DEU 23:8 The children of the third generation who are born to them may enter into Adonai’s assembly.
DEU 23:9 When you go out and camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing.
DEU 23:10 If there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night, then shall he go outside of the camp. He shall not come within the camp;
DEU 23:11 but it shall be, when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in water. When the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.
DEU 23:12 You shall have a place also outside of the camp where you go relieve yourself.
DEU 23:13 You shall have a trowel among your weapons. It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement;
DEU 23:14 for Adonai your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you. Therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
DEU 23:15 You shall not deliver to his master a servant who has escaped from his master to you.
DEU 23:16 He shall dwell with you, among you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best. You shall not oppress him.
DEU 23:17 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel [God prevails], neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 23:18 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a male prostitute, into the house of Adonai your God for any vow; for both of these are an abomination to Adonai your God.
DEU 23:19 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest.
DEU 23:20 You may lend on interest to a foreigner; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that Adonai your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.
DEU 23:21 When you vow a vow to Adonai your God, you shall not be slack to pay it; for Adonai your God will surely require it of you; and it would be crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· to you.
DEU 23:22 But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· in you.
DEU 23:23 You shall observe and do that which has gone out of your lips. Whatever you have vowed to Adonai your God as a free will offering, which you have promised with your mouth, you must do. (5)
DEU 23:24 When you come and enter into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your container.
DEU 23:25 When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor’s standing grain.
DEU 24:1 When a man takes a wife and marries her, then it shall be, if she finds no chen ·grace· in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a get ·bill of divorce·, and put it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
DEU 24:2 When she has departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife.
DEU 24:3 If the latter husband hates her, and write her a bill of divorce, and puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
DEU 24:4 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is detestable to Adonai. You shall not cause the land to sin ·err (from the standard goal)·, which Adonai your God gives you for an inheritance. (6)
DEU 24:5 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any business. He shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken.
DEU 24:6 No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone as a pledge; for he takes a life in pledge.
DEU 24:7 If a man is found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel [God prevails], and he deals with him as a slave, or sells him; then that thief shall die. So you shall remove the evil from among you.
DEU 24:8 Be careful in the plague of tzara'at, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites [Descendants of United with] teach you. As I enjoined them, so you shall observe to do.
DEU 24:9 Remember what Adonai your God did to Miriam [Rebellion], by the way as you came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
DEU 24:10 When you lend your neighbor any kind of loan, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.
DEU 24:11 You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge outside to you.
DEU 24:12 If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge.
DEU 24:13 You shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you. It shall be righteousness to you before Adonai your God. (7)
DEU 24:14 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers, or one of the foreigners who are in your land within your gates.
DEU 24:15 In his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it; lest he cry against you to Adonai, and it be crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· to you.
DEU 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers. Every man shall be put to death for his own crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal·.
DEU 24:17 You shall not deprive the foreigner or the orphan of mishpat ·justice·, nor take a widow’s clothing in pledge;
DEU 24:18 but you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt [Abode of slavery], and Adonai your God redeemed you there. Therefore I enjoin you to do this thing.
DEU 24:19 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it. It shall be for the foreigner, for the orphan, and for the widow; that Adonai your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
DEU 24:20 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again. It shall be for the foreigner, for the orphan, and for the widow.
DEU 24:21 When you harvest your vineyard, you shall not glean it after yourselves. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
DEU 24:22 You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Therefore I enjoin you to do this thing.
DEU 25:1 If there is a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them; then they shall justify the upright, and condemn as guilty the wicked.
DEU 25:2 It shall be, if the wicked man is worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by number.
DEU 25:3 He may sentence him to no more than forty stripes. He shall not give more; lest, if he should give more, and beat him more than that many stripes, then your brother will be degraded in your sight.
DEU 25:4 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain.
DEU 25:5 If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies, and has no son, the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger. Her husband’s brother shall go in to her, and take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.
DEU 25:6 It shall be that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be blotted out of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 25:7 If the man does not want to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel [God prevails]. He will not perform the duty of a husband’s brother to me.”
DEU 25:8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him: and if he stands and says, “I don’t want to take her;”
DEU 25:9 then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face. She shall answer and say, “So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.”
DEU 25:10 His name shall be called in Israel [God prevails], “The house of him who had his shoe removed.”
DEU 25:11 When men strive against each other, and the wife of one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts out her hand, and takes him by his private parts,
DEU 25:12 then you shall cut off her hand. Your eye shall have no pity.
DEU 25:13 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, one heavy and one light.
DEU 25:14 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, one large and one small.
DEU 25:15 You shall have a perfect and just weight. You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may be long in the land which Adonai your God gives you.
DEU 25:16 For all who do such things, all who deal dishonestly, are an abomination to Adonai your God. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 25:17 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came out of Egypt [Abode of slavery];
DEU 25:18 how he met you by the way, and struck the rearmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he didn’t fear God.
DEU 25:19 Therefore it shall be, when Adonai your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around, in the land which Adonai your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek [Man who licks up] from under the sky. You shall not forget.

DEU 26:3 You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, “I profess today to Adonai your God, that I have come to the land which Adonai swore to our fathers to give us.”

DEU 26:5 You shall answer and say before Adonai your God, “My father was a Syrian ready to perish. He went down into Egypt [Abode of slavery], and lived there, few in number. There he became a great, mighty, and populous nation.
DEU 26:6 The Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] mistreated us, afflicted us, and imposed hard labor on us.
DEU 26:7 Then we cried to Adonai, the God of our fathers. Adonai sh'ma ·hear obey· our voice, and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.
DEU 26:8 Adonai brought us out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, with great terror, with signs, and with wonders;
DEU 26:9 and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
DEU 26:10 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, Adonai, have given me.” You shall set it down before Adonai your God, and hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship before Adonai your God.
DEU 26:11 You shall rejoice in all the good which Adonai your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite [Descendant of United with], and the foreigner who is among you. (2)

DEU 26:13 You shall say before Adonai your God, “I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the orphan, and to the widow, according to all your mitzvot ·instructions· which you have enjoined me. I have not transgressed any of your mitzvot ·instructions·, neither have I forgotten them.
DEU 26:14 I have not eaten of it in my vain striving of iniquity mourning, neither have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor given of it for the dead. I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· Adonai my God’s voice. I have done according to all that you have enjoined me.
DEU 26:15 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel [God prevails], and the ground which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.” (3)
DEU 26:16 Today Adonai your God enjoins to you to do these statutes and judgments. You shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart and with all your soul.

DEU 27:2 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan [Descender] to the land which Adonai your God gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones, and coat them with plaster.
DEU 27:3 You shall write on them all the words of this Torah ·Teaching·, when you have passed over; that you may go in to the land which Adonai your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Adonai, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
DEU 27:4 It shall be, when you have crossed over the Jordan [Descender], that you shall set up these stones, which I enjoin you today, on Mount Ebal, and you shall coat them with plaster.
DEU 27:5 There you shall build an altar to Adonai your God, an altar of stones. You shall not use any iron tool on them.
DEU 27:6 You shall build Adonai your God’s altar of uncut stones. You shall offer burnt offerings on it to Adonai your God.
DEU 27:7 You shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there. You shall rejoice before Adonai your God.
DEU 27:8 You shall write on the stones all the words of this Torah ·Teaching· very plainly.”

DEU 27:10 You shall therefore sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, and do his instructions and his statutes, which I enjoin you today.” (5)
DEU 27:11 Moses [Drawn out] enjoined the people the same day, saying,
DEU 27:12 “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you have crossed over the Jordan [Descender]: Simeon [Hearing], Levi [United with], Judah [Praised], Issachar [Hire, Reward], Joseph [May he add], and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south].
DEU 27:13 These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben [See, a son!], Gad [Good fortune], Asher [Happy], Zebulun [Living together], Dan [He judged], and Naphtali [My wrestling].
DEU 27:14 With a loud voice, the Levites [Descendants of United with] shall say to all the men of Israel [God prevails],
DEU 27:15 ‘Cursed is the man who makes an engraved or molten image, an abomination to Adonai, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.’ All the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen ·So be it·.’

DEU 28:1 It shall happen, if you shall sh'ma ·hear obey· sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, to observe to do all his mitzvot ·instructions· which I enjoin you today, that Adonai your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.

DEU 28:12 Adonai will open to you his good treasure in the sky, to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. You will lend to many nations, and you will not borrow.
DEU 28:13 Adonai will make you the head, and not the tail. You will be above only, and you will not be beneath; if you sh'ma ·hear obey· the mitzvot ·instructions· of Adonai your God, which I enjoin you today, to observe and to do,
DEU 28:14 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I enjoin you today, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other deities to abad ·serve· them.
DEU 28:15 But it shall come to pass, if you will not sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, to observe to do all his mitzvot ·instructions· and his statutes which I enjoin you today, that all these curses will come on you, and overtake you.
DEU 28:16 You will be cursed in the city, and you will be cursed in the field.
DEU 28:17 Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.
DEU 28:18 The fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock will be cursed.

DEU 28:20 Adonai will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke, in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings, by which you have forsaken me.
DEU 28:21 Adonai will make the pestilence cling to you, until he has consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it.
DEU 28:22 Adonai will strike you with consumption, with fever, with inflammation, with fiery heat, with the sword, with blight, and with tzara'at mildew. They will pursue you until you perish.
DEU 28:23 Your sky that is over your head will be bronze, and the earth that is under you will be iron.
DEU 28:24 Adonai will make the rain of your land powder and dust. It will come down on you from the sky, until you are destroyed.
DEU 28:25 Adonai will cause you to be struck before your enemies. You will go out one way against them, and will flee seven ways before them. You will be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
DEU 28:26 Your dead body will be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there will be no one to frighten them away.
DEU 28:27 Adonai will strike you with the boils of Egypt [Abode of slavery], with the tumors, with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you cannot be healed.
DEU 28:28 Adonai will strike you with madness, with blindness, and with astonishment of heart.
DEU 28:29 You will grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways. You will only be oppressed and robbed always, and there will be no one to save you.
DEU 28:30 You will betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her. You will build a house, and you won’t dwell in it. You will plant a vineyard, and not use its fruit.
DEU 28:31 Your ox will be slain before your eyes, and you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be violently taken away from before your face, and will not be restored to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have no one to save you.
DEU 28:32 Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people. Your eyes will look, and fail with longing for them all day long. There will be no power in your hand.
DEU 28:33 A nation which you don’t know eat the fruit of your ground and all of your work. You will only be oppressed and crushed always;
DEU 28:34 so that the sights that you see with your eyes will drive you mad.
DEU 28:35 Adonai will strike you in the knees and in the legs with a sore boil, of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
DEU 28:36 Adonai will bring you, and your king whom you will set over yourselves, to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers. There you will abad ·serve· other deities of wood and stone.
DEU 28:37 You will become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples where Adonai will lead you away.
DEU 28:38 You will carry much seed out into the field, and will gather little in; for the locust will consume it.
DEU 28:39 You will plant vineyards and dress them, but you will neither drink of the wine, nor harvest, because worms will eat them.
DEU 28:40 You will have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you won’t anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives will drop off.

DEU 28:43 The foreigner who is among you will mount up above you higher and higher, and you will come down lower and lower.
DEU 28:44 He will lend to you, and you won’t lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail.
DEU 28:45 All these curses will come on you, and will pursue you, and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, to keep his mitzvot ·instructions· and his statutes which he enjoined you.
DEU 28:46 They will be for a sign and for a wonder to you and to your offspring forever.
DEU 28:47 Because you didn’t abad ·serve· Adonai your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;
DEU 28:48 therefore you will abad ·serve· your enemies whom Adonai sends against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in lack of all things. He will put an iron yoke on your neck, until he has destroyed you.
DEU 28:49 Adonai will bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language you will not sh'ma ·hear understand obey·;
DEU 28:50 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that does not respect the elderly, nor show favor to the young,
DEU 28:51 and they will eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed. They also won’t leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
DEU 28:52 They will besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land. They will besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which Adonai your God has given you.
DEU 28:53 You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom Adonai your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies will distress you.
DEU 28:54 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil toward his brother, toward the wife whom he loves, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;
DEU 28:55 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he will eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in all your gates.
DEU 28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil toward the husband that she loves, toward her son, toward her daughter,
DEU 28:57 toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates.
DEU 28:58 If you will not observe to do all the words of this Torah ·Teaching· that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, Yahweh Eloheinu [He sustains breathing Your God];
DEU 28:59 then Adonai will make your plagues fearful, and the plagues of your offspring, even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long duration.
DEU 28:60 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt [Abode of slavery], which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you.
DEU 28:61 Also every sickness and every plague, which is not written in the book of this Torah ·Teaching·, Adonai will bring them on you, until you are destroyed.
DEU 28:62 You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice.
DEU 28:63 It will happen that as Adonai rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Adonai will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you. You will be plucked from off of the land where you go in to possess it.
DEU 28:64 Adonai will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. There you will abad ·serve· other deities, which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.
DEU 28:65 Among these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; but Adonai will give you there a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and pining of soul.
DEU 28:66 Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life.
DEU 28:67 In the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening you will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see.
DEU 28:68 Adonai will bring you into Egypt [Abode of slavery] again with ships, by the way of which I told to you that you would never see it again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies for male and female slaves, and nobody will buy you.
DEU 29:1 These are the words of the covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· which Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out] to make with the children of Israel [God prevails] in the land of Moab [From father], in addition to the covenant which he made with them in Horeb [Desert]. (7)
DEU 29:2 Moses [Drawn out] called to all Israel [God prevails], and said to them: Your eyes have seen all that Adonai did in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
DEU 29:3 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.
DEU 29:4 But Adonai has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to sh'ma ·hear obey·, to this day.
DEU 29:5 I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoes have not grown old on your feet.
DEU 29:6 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Adonai your God. (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 29:7 When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we struck them.
DEU 29:8 We took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.
DEU 29:9 Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
DEU 29:10 All of you stand today in the presence of Adonai your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel [God prevails],
DEU 29:11 your little ones, your wives, and the foreigners who are in the middle of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;
DEU 29:12 that you may enter into the covenant of Adonai your God, and into his oath, which Adonai your God makes with you today; (LY:2)
DEU 29:13 that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he spoke to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter].
DEU 29:14 Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only,
DEU 29:15 but with those who stand here with us today before Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God], and also with those who are not here with us today (LY:3)
DEU 29:16 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and how we came through the middle of the nations through which you passed;
DEU 29:17 and you have seen their detestable things and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
DEU 29:18 lest there should be among you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away today from Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God], to go to abad ·serve· the deities of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison;
DEU 29:19 and it happen, when he sh'ma ·hears obeys· the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.”
DEU 29:20 Adonai will not pardon him, but then Adonai’s anger and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will fall on him, and Adonai will blot out his name from under the sky.
DEU 29:21 Adonai will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel [God prevails], according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the Torah ·Teaching·.
DEU 29:22 The generation to come, your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land, will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Adonai has made it sick;
DEU 29:23 and that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, does not produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom [Burning], Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants], Admah, and Zeboiim, which Adonai overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath;
DEU 29:24 even all the nations will say, “Why has Adonai done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?”
DEU 29:25 Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Adonai, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery],
DEU 29:26 and went and abad ·served· other deities, and hawa ·bowed low, prostrated· in worship them, deities that they didn’t know, and that he had not given to them.
DEU 29:27 Therefore Adonai’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book.
DEU 29:28 Adonai rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.”
DEU 29:29 The secret things belong to Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God]; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this Torah ·Teaching·.
DEU 30:1 It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where Adonai your God has driven you,
DEU 30:2 and teshuvah ·completely return· to Adonai your God, and sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice according to all that I enjoin you today, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;
DEU 30:3 that then Adonai your God will release you from captivity, have racham ·compassionate love· on you, and will make teshuvah ·complete return· and gather you from all the peoples where Adonai your God has scattered you.
DEU 30:4 If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there Adonai your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back.
DEU 30:5 Adonai your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you will possess it. He will do you good, and increase your numbers more than your fathers.
DEU 30:6 Adonai your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your offspring, to 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live. (RY:3, LY:5)
DEU 30:7 Adonai your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
DEU 30:8 You shall make teshuvah ·complete return· and sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai’s voice, and do all his mitzvot ·instructions· which I enjoin you today.
DEU 30:9 Adonai your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good; for Adonai will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers;
DEU 30:10 if you will sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai your God’s voice, to keep his mitzvot ·instructions· and his statutes which are written in this book of the Torah ·Teaching·; if you turn to Adonai your God with all your heart, and with all your soul. (LY:6)
DEU 30:11 For this mitzvah ·instruction· which I enjoin you today is not too hard for you or too distant.
DEU 30:12 It is not in heaven, so that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may sh'ma ·hear obey· it, so we may do it?”
DEU 30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may that we may sh'ma ·hear obey· it, so it, so we may do it?”
DEU 30:14 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it. (RY:4, LY:7)
DEU 30:15 Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil.
DEU 30:16 For I enjoin you today to 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his mitzvot ·instructions·, his statutes, and his judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that Adonai your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it.
DEU 30:17 But if your heart turns away, and you will not sh'ma ·hear obey·, but are drawn away, and hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship other deities, and abad ·serve· them; (LY: Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 30:18 I denounce to you today, that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan [Descender] to go in to possess it.
DEU 30:19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants;
DEU 30:20 to 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai your God, to sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice, and to dabak ·cling to, worship· him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which Adonai swore to your fathers, to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter], to give them.
DEU 31:1 Moses [Drawn out] went and spoke these words to all Israel [God prevails].
DEU 31:2 He said to them, “I am one hundred twenty years old today. I can no more go out and come in. Adonai has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan [Descender].’
DEU 31:3 Adonai your God himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua [Yah Salvation] will go over before you, as Adonai has spoken. (LY:2)
DEU 31:4 Adonai will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], and to their land; whom he destroyed.
DEU 31:5 Adonai will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the mitzvot ·instructions· I have enjoined you.
DEU 31:6 Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them; for Adonai your God himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you.” (RY:5, LY:3)
DEU 31:7 Moses [Drawn out] called to Joshua [Yah Salvation], and said to him in the sight of all Israel [God prevails], “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which Adonai has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.
DEU 31:8 Adonai himself is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be discouraged.”
DEU 31:9 Moses [Drawn out] wrote this Torah ·Teaching·, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi [United with], who bore the ark of Adonai’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 31:10 Moses [Drawn out] enjoined them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the festival of Sukkot ·Booths·,
DEU 31:11 when all Israel [God prevails] has come to appear before Adonai your God in the place which he will choose, you shall read this Torah ·Teaching· before all Israel [God prevails] in their hearing.
DEU 31:12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may sh'ma ·hear obey·, and that they may learn, and fear Adonai your God, and observe to do all the words of this Torah ·Teaching·;
DEU 31:13 and that their children, who have not known, may sh'ma ·hear obey·, and learn to fear Adonai your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan [Descender] to possess it.” (RY:6, LY:5)
DEU 31:14 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua [Yah Salvation], and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may enjoin him.” Moses [Drawn out] and Joshua [Yah Salvation] went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
DEU 31:15 Adonai appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door.
DEU 31:16 Adonai said to Moses [Drawn out], “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange deities of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· which I have made with them.
DEU 31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our God is not among us?’
DEU 31:18 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other deities.
DEU 31:19 “Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel [God prevails]. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel [God prevails]. (RY:7, LY:6)
DEU 31:20 For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then they will turn to other deities, and abad ·serve· them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
DEU 31:21 It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.”
DEU 31:22 So Moses [Drawn out] wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 31:23 He enjoined Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel [God prevails] into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.”
DEU 31:24 When Moses [Drawn out] had finished writing the words of this Torah ·Teaching· in a book, until they were finished, (LY:7)
DEU 31:25 Moses [Drawn out] enjoined the Levites [Descendants of United with], who bore the ark of Adonai’s covenant, saying,
DEU 31:26 “Take this book of the Torah ·Teaching·, and put it by the side of the ark of Adonai’s covenant your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.
DEU 31:27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against Adonai. How much more after my death? (Maftir ·Conclusion·)
DEU 31:28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
DEU 31:29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have enjoined you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do what Adonai sees as evil and provoke him to anger by your deeds.”
DEU 31:30 Moses [Drawn out] spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel [God prevails] the words of this song, until they were finished.
DEU 32:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, oh heavens, and I will speak! Let the earth hear the words of my mouth!
DEU 32:2 My doctrine will drop as the rain. My speech will condense as the dew, as the misty rain on the tender grass, as the showers on the herb.
DEU 32:3 For I will proclaim Adonai’s name. Ascribe greatness to our God!
DEU 32:4 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are mishpat ·just·. A God of faithfulness who does no wrong, just and right is he.
DEU 32:5 They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his children, because of their defect. They are a perverse and crooked generation.
DEU 32:6 Is this the way you repay Adonai, foolish and unwise people? Is not he your father who has bought you? He has made you and established you. (2)
DEU 32:7 Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.
DEU 32:8 When haElyon [the Most High] gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 32:9 For Adonai’s portion is his people. Jacob [Supplanter] is the lot of his inheritance.
DEU 32:10 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye.
DEU 32:11 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them on his feathers.
DEU 32:12 Adonai alone led him. There was no foreign deity with him. (3)
DEU 32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;
DEU 32:14 butter from the herd, and milk from the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat. From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.
DEU 32:15 But Jeshurun [Upright one] grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he abandoned God who made him, and rejected the Rock of his yishu'ah ·salvation·.
DEU 32:16 They moved him to jealousy with strange deities. They provoked him to anger with abominations.
DEU 32:17 They sacrificed to demons, not God, to deities that they didn’t know, to new deities that came up recently, which your fathers didn’t dread.
DEU 32:18 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave you birth. (4)
DEU 32:19 Adonai saw and abhorred, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
DEU 32:20 He said, “I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end will be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.
DEU 32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will provoke them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
DEU 32:22 For a fire is kindled in my anger, that burns to the lowest Sheol ·Place of the dead·, devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.
DEU 32:23 “I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them.
DEU 32:24 They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, with the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.
DEU 32:25 Outside the sword will bereave, and in the rooms, terror; on both young man and virgin, the nursing infant with the gray-haired man.
DEU 32:26 I said that I would scatter them afar. I would make their memory to cease from among men;
DEU 32:27 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted, Adonai has not done all this.’”
DEU 32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them. (5)
DEU 32:29 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
DEU 32:30 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Adonai had delivered them up?
DEU 32:31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves concede.
DEU 32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom [Burning], of the fields of Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants]. Their grapes are poison grapes. Their clusters are bitter.
DEU 32:33 Their wine is the poison of serpents, the cruel venom of asps.
DEU 32:34 “Is not this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
DEU 32:35 Vengeance and recompense is mine, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. Their doom rushes at them.”
DEU 32:36 For Adonai will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that their power is gone; that there is no one remaining, shut up or left at large.
DEU 32:37 He will say, “Where are their deities, the rock in which they took refuge;
DEU 32:38 which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.
DEU 32:39 “See now that I myself am he. There is no elohim ·deity· with me. I kill and I make alive. I wound and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand. (6)
DEU 32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare, as I live forever,
DEU 32:41 if I sharpen my glittering sword, my hand grasps it in judgment; I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will repay those who hate me.
DEU 32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”
DEU 32:43 Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will take vengeance on his adversaries, and will make atonement for his land and for his people. (7)
DEU 32:44 Moses [Drawn out] came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun.
DEU 32:45 Moses [Drawn out] finished reciting all these words to all Israel [God prevails].
DEU 32:46 He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you shall enjoin your children to observe to do, all the words of this Torah ·Teaching·.
DEU 32:47 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan [Descender] to possess it.” (Maftir)
DEU 32:48 Adonai spoke to Moses [Drawn out] that same day, saying,
DEU 32:49 “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab [From father], that is across from Jericho [Fragrant, Moon]; and see the land of Canaan [Humbled], which I give to the children of Israel [God prevails] for a possession.
DEU 32:50 Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron [Light-bringer] your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;
DEU 32:51 because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel [God prevails] at the waters of Meribah [Quarreling] of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of Israel [God prevails].
DEU 32:52 For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel [God prevails].”
DEU 33:1 This is the blessing that Moses [Drawn out] the man of God blessed the children of Israel [God prevails] before his death.
DEU 33:2 He said, “Adonai came from Sinai [Thorn], and rose from Seir to them. He shone from Mount Paran. He came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
DEU 33:3 Yes, he choveiv ·hides in bosom, loves· the people. All his saints are in your hand. They sat down at your feet. Each receives your words.
DEU 33:4 The Torah ·Teaching· Moses [Drawn out] enjoined us, an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob [Supplanter].
DEU 33:5 He was king in Jeshurun [Upright one], when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel [God prevails] together.
DEU 33:6 “Let Reuben [See, a son!] live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.”
DEU 33:7 This is for Judah [Praised]. He said, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Adonai, the voice of Judah [Praised]. Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself. You shall be a help against his adversaries.” (2)
DEU 33:8 About Levi [United with] he said, “Your Thummim ·Perfections· and your 'Urim ·Lights· are with your pious one, whom you proved at Massah [Testing], with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah [Quarreling].
DEU 33:9 He said of his father, and of his mother, ‘I have not seen him.’ He didn’t acknowledge his brothers, nor did he know his own children; for they have observed your word, and keep your covenant.
DEU 33:10 They shall teach Jacob [Supplanter] your judgments, and Israel [God prevails] your Torah ·Teaching·. They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering on your altar.
DEU 33:11 Adonai, bless his skills. Accept the work of his hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him, of those who hate him, that they not rise again.”
DEU 33:12 About Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south] he said, “The Yadid ·Beloved· of Adonai will dwell in safety by him. He covers him all day long. He dwells between his shoulders.” (3)
DEU 33:13 About Joseph [May he add] he said, “His land is blessed by Adonai, for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep that couches beneath,
DEU 33:14 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious things that the moon can yield,
DEU 33:15 for the best things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
DEU 33:16 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, the good will of him who lived in the bush. Let this come on the head of Joseph [May he add], on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.
DEU 33:17 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he will push all the peoples, to the ends of the earth. They are the ten thousands of Ephraim [Fruit]. They are the thousands of Manasseh [Causing to forget].” (4)
DEU 33:18 About Zebulun [Living together] he said, “Rejoice, Zebulun [Living together], in your going out; and Issachar [Hire, Reward], in your tents.
DEU 33:19 They will call the peoples to the mountain. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they will draw out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.”
DEU 33:20 About Gad [Good fortune] he said, “He who enlarges Gad [Good fortune] is blessed. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.
DEU 33:21 He provided the first part for himself, for the Torah-giver’s portion reserved was reserved for him. He came with the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of Adonai, His judgments with Israel [God prevails].” (5)
DEU 33:22 About Dan [He judged] he said, “Dan [He judged] is a lion’s cub that leaps out of Bashan.”
DEU 33:23 About Naphtali [My wrestling] he said, “Naphtali [My wrestling], satisfied with favor, full of Adonai’s blessing, Possess the west and the south.”
DEU 33:24 About Asher [Happy] he said, “Asher [Happy] is blessed with children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers. Let him dip his foot in oil.
DEU 33:25 Your bars will be iron and bronze. As your days, so your strength will be.
DEU 33:26 “There is no one like God, Jeshurun [Upright one], who rides on the heavens for your help, in his excellency on the skies. (6)
DEU 33:27 The eternal God is your dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He divorce and cast away the enemy from before you, and said, ‘Destroy!’
DEU 33:28 Israel [God prevails] dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob [Supplanter] alone, In a land of grain and new wine. Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
DEU 33:29 You are happy, Israel [God prevails]! Who is like you, a people saved by Adonai, the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency? Your enemies will submit themselves to you. You will tread on their high places.”
DEU 34:1 Moses [Drawn out] went up from the plains of Moab [From father] to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho [Fragrant, Moon]. Adonai showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan [He judged],
DEU 34:2 and all Naphtali [My wrestling], and the land of Ephraim [Fruit] and Manasseh [Causing to forget], and all the land of Judah [Praised], to the western sea,
DEU 34:3 and the south, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho [Fragrant, Moon] the city of palm trees, to Zoar [Small].
DEU 34:4 Adonai said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham [Father of a multitude], to Isaac [Laughter], and to Jacob [Supplanter], saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.”
DEU 34:5 So Moses [Drawn out] the servant of Adonai died there in the land of Moab [From father], according to Adonai’s word.
DEU 34:6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab [From father] opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where his tomb is to this day.
DEU 34:7 Moses [Drawn out] was one hundred twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his strength gone.
DEU 34:8 The children of Israel [God prevails] wept for Moses [Drawn out] in the plains of Moab [From father] thirty days, until the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses [Drawn out] were ended.
DEU 34:9 Joshua [Yah Salvation] the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses [Drawn out] had laid his hands on him. The children of Israel [God prevails] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· him, and did as Adonai enjoined Moses [Drawn out].
DEU 34:10 Since then, there has not arisen a prophet in Israel [God prevails] like Moses [Drawn out], whom Adonai knew face to face,
DEU 34:11 in all the signs and the wonders, which Adonai sent him to do in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
DEU 34:12 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds, which Moses [Drawn out] did in the sight of all Israel [God prevails].
PSA 1:1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand on the path of people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal·, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
PSA 1:2 but his delight is in Adonai’s Torah ·Teaching·. On his torot ·teachings· he meditates day and night.
PSA 1:3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that produces its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.
PSA 1:4 The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
PSA 1:5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· in the congregation of the upright.
PSA 1:6 For Adonai knows the way of the upright, but the way of the wicked shall perish.
PSA 2:1 Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
PSA 2:2 The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Adonai , and against his Anointed, saying,
PSA 2:3 “Let’s break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us.”
PSA 2:4 He who sits in the heavens will laugh. 'Adonay [Lord] will have them in derision.
PSA 2:5 Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath:
PSA 2:6 “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].”
PSA 2:7 I will tell of the statute. Adonai said to me, “You are my son. Today I have become your father.
PSA 2:8 Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
PSA 2:9 You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like pottery.”
PSA 2:10 Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
PSA 2:11 Abad ·Serve· Adonai with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
PSA 2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.
PSA 3:1 Adonai, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me.
PSA 3:2 Many there are who say of my soul, “There is no yishu'ah ·salvation· for him in God.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·
PSA 3:3 But you, Adonai, are a shield around me, my kavod ·weighty glory·, and the one who lifts up my head.
PSA 3:4 I cry to Adonai with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·
PSA 3:5 I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Adonai sustains me.
PSA 3:6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.
PSA 3:7 Arise, Adonai! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
PSA 3:8 Yishu'ah ·Salvation· belongs to Adonai. Your blessing be on your people. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·
PSA 4:1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and sh'ma ·hear obey· my prayer.
PSA 4:2 You sons of men, how long shall my kavod ·weighty glory· be turned into dishonor? Will you 'ahav ·affectionately love· vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·
PSA 4:3 But know that Adonai has set apart for himself him who is godly: Adonai will sh'ma ·hear obey· when I call to him.
PSA 4:4 You can be angry, but don’t sin ·err (from the standard goal)·. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·
PSA 4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Adonai.
PSA 4:6 Many say, “Who will show us any good?” Adonai, let the light of your face shine on us.
PSA 4:7 You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.
PSA 4:8 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you, Adonai alone, make me live in safety.
PSA 5:1 Give ear to my words, Adonai. Consider my meditation.
PSA 5:2 Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to you do I pray.
PSA 5:3 Adonai, in the morning you shall sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.
PSA 5:4 For you are not a God who has pleasure in ethical wickedness. Evil can’t live with you.
PSA 5:5 The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of vain striving of iniquity.
PSA 5:6 You will destroy those who speak lies. Adonai abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
PSA 5:7 But as for me, in the abundance of your chesed ·loving-kindness· I will come into your house. I will hawa ·bow low, prostrate· toward your holy temple in reverence of you.
PSA 5:8 Lead me, Adonai, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.
PSA 5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.
PSA 5:10 Hold them condemned guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their rebellious breaches of relationships, for they have rebelled against you.
PSA 5:11 But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice, Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who 'ahav ·affectionately love· your name be joyful in you.
PSA 5:12 For you will bless the upright. Adonai, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.
PSA 6:1 Adonai, don’t rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath.
PSA 6:2 Have mercy on me, Adonai, for I am faint. Adonai, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
PSA 6:3 My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Adonai, how long?
PSA 6:4 Teshuvah ·Completely return·, Adonai. Deliver my soul, and save me for your chesed ·loving-kindness’· sake.
PSA 6:5 For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol ·Place of the dead·, who shall yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you?
PSA 6:6 I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.
PSA 6:7 My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.
PSA 6:8 Depart from me, all you workers of vain striving of iniquity, for Adonai has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of my weeping.
PSA 6:9 Adonai has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my supplication. Adonai accepts my prayer.
PSA 6:10 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
PSA 7:1 Adonai, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
PSA 7:2 lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.
PSA 7:3 Adonai, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands,
PSA 7:4 if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),
PSA 7:5 let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 7:6 Arise, Adonai, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have enjoined judgment.
PSA 7:7 Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.
PSA 7:8 Adonai administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Adonai, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.
PSA 7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the upright; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.
PSA 7:10 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
PSA 7:11 God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.
PSA 7:12 If a man does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.
PSA 7:13 He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.
PSA 7:14 Behold, he travails with vain striving of iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief, and brought out falsehood.
PSA 7:15 He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made.
PSA 7:16 The trouble he causes shall teshuvah ·completely return· to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.
PSA 7:17 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai according to his righteousness, and will make zahmar ·musical praise· to the name of Adonai Most High.
PSA 8:1 Adonai, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who has set your glory above the heavens!
PSA 8:2 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.
PSA 8:3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
PSA 8:4 what is man, that you think of him? What is the son of man, that you care for him?
PSA 8:5 For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and crowned him with glory and honor.
PSA 8:6 You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:
PSA 8:7 All sheep and cattle, yes, and the animals of the field,
PSA 8:8 The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
PSA 8:9 Adonai, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
PSA 9:1 א I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.
PSA 9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to your name, O Most High.
PSA 9:3 בּ When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.
PSA 9:4 For you have maintained my mishpat ·just· cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.
PSA 9:5 גּ You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
PSA 9:6 The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.
PSA 9:7 But Adonai reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.
PSA 9:8 ה He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
PSA 9:9 Adonai will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble.
PSA 9:10 Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Adonai, have not forsaken those who seek you.
PSA 9:11 ז Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai, who dwells in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and declare among the people what he has done.
PSA 9:12 For he who avenges blood remembers them. He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
PSA 9:13 ח Have mercy on me, Adonai. See my affliction by those who hate me, and lift me up from the gates of death;
PSA 9:14 that I may show all of your tehilah ·praise song·. In the gates of the daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], I will rejoice in your yishu'ah ·salvation·.
PSA 9:15 ט The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
PSA 9:16 Adonai has made himself known. He has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. Higgayon ·Meditation·. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 9:17 י The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol ·Place of the dead·, even all the nations that forget God.
PSA 9:18 כּ For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever.
PSA 9:19 Arise, Adonai! Don’t let man prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight.
PSA 9:20 Put them in fear, Adonai. Let the nations know that they are only men. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 10:1 ל Why do you stand far off, Adonai? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
PSA 10:2 In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.
PSA 10:3 For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. He blesses the greedy, and condemns Adonai.
PSA 10:4 The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his thoughts for God.
PSA 10:5 His ways are prosperous at all times. He is haughty, and your judgments are far from his sight. As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.
PSA 10:6 He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble.”
PSA 10:7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and vain striving of iniquity.
PSA 10:8 He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.
PSA 10:9 He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless. He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.
PSA 10:10 The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under his strength.
PSA 10:11 He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.”
PSA 10:12 ק Arise, Adonai! God, lift up your hand! Don’t forget the helpless.
PSA 10:13 Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”
PSA 10:14 ר But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.
PSA 10:15 שׁ Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his ethical wickedness until you find none.
PSA 10:16 Adonai is King forever and ever! The nations will perish out of his land.
PSA 10:17 ת Adonai, you have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,
PSA 10:18 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
PSA 11:1 In Adonai, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!”
PSA 11:2 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
PSA 11:3 If the foundations are destroyed, what can the upright do?
PSA 11:4 Adonai is in his holy temple. Adonai is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.
PSA 11:5 Adonai examines the upright, but the wicked and him who 'ahav ·affectionately loves· violence his soul hates.
PSA 11:6 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
PSA 11:7 For Adonai is righteous. He 'ahav ·affectionately loves· righteousness. The upright shall see his face.
PSA 12:1 Help, Adonai; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
PSA 12:2 Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.
PSA 12:3 May Adonai cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts,
PSA 12:4 who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?”
PSA 12:5 “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says Adonai; “I will set him in yesha' ·salvation· far from those who malign him.”
PSA 12:6 Adonai’s words are flawless words, as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
PSA 12:7 You will keep them, Adonai. You will preserve them from this generation forever.
PSA 12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
PSA 13:1 How long, Adonai? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
PSA 13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
PSA 13:3 Behold, and answer me, Adonai, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
PSA 13:4 Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;” Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.
PSA 13:5 But I trust in your chesed ·loving-kindness·. My heart rejoices in your yishu'ah ·salvation·.
PSA 13:6 I will sing to Adonai, because he has been good to me.
PSA 14:1 The fool has said in his heart, “There is no Elohim ·Deity, Judge·.” They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds. There is no one who does good.
PSA 14:2 Adonai looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God.
PSA 14:3 All have gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is no one who does good, no, not one.
PSA 14:4 Have all the workers of vain striving of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don’t call on Adonai?
PSA 14:5 There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the upright.
PSA 14:6 You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Adonai is his refuge.
PSA 14:7 Oh that the yishu'ah ·salvation· of Israel [God prevails] would come out of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]! When Adonai restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob [Supplanter] shall rejoice, and Israel [God prevails] shall be glad.
PSA 15:1 Adonai, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?
PSA 15:2 He who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart;
PSA 15:3 He who does not slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
PSA 15:4 In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Adonai; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change;
PSA 15:5 he who does not lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
PSA 16:1 Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.
PSA 16:2 My soul, you have said to Adonai, “You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing.”
PSA 16:3 As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.
PSA 16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another deity. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips.
PSA 16:5 Adonai assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure.
PSA 16:6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.
PSA 16:7 I will bless Adonai, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.
PSA 16:8 I always set Adonai before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
PSA 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my kavod ·weighty glory· rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety.
PSA 16:10 For you will not leave my soul in Sheol ·Place of the dead·, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.
PSA 16:11 You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.
PSA 17:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Adonai, my righteous plea; Give ear to my prayer, that does not go out of deceitful lips.
PSA 17:2 Let my judgement come out of your presence. Let your eyes look on equity.
PSA 17:3 You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night. You have tried me, and found nothing. I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.
PSA 17:4 As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips, I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.
PSA 17:5 My steps have held fast to your paths. My feet have not slipped.
PSA 17:6 I have called on you, for you will answer me, God. Turn your ear to me. Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my speech.
PSA 17:7 Show your marvelous chesed ·loving-kindness·, you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.
PSA 17:8 Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me under the shadow of your wings,
PSA 17:9 from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly enemies, who surround me.
PSA 17:10 They close up their callous hearts. With their mouth they speak proudly.
PSA 17:11 They have now surrounded us in our steps. They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
PSA 17:12 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
PSA 17:13 Arise, Adonai, confront him. Cast him down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;
PSA 17:14 from men by your hand, Adonai, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life. You fill the belly of your cherished ones. Your sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.
PSA 17:15 As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.
PSA 18:1 I will racham ·compassionately love, mercifully love· you, Adonai, my strength.
PSA 18:2 Adonai is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my yesha' ·salvation·, my high tower.
PSA 18:3 I call on Adonai, who is worthy to be praised; and I am saved from my enemies.
PSA 18:4 The cords of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
PSA 18:5 The cords of Sheol ·Place of the dead· were around me. The snares of death came on me.
PSA 18:6 In my distress I called on Adonai, and cried to my God. He sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my voice out of his temple. My cry before him came into his ears.
PSA 18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
PSA 18:8 Smoke went out of his nostrils. Consuming fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it.
PSA 18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.
PSA 18:10 He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.
PSA 18:11 He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
PSA 18:12 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA 18:13 Adonai also thundered in the sky. The Most High uttered his voice: hailstones and coals of fire.
PSA 18:14 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them.
PSA 18:15 Then the channels of waters appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Adonai, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
PSA 18:16 He sent from on high. He took me. He drew me out of many waters.
PSA 18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
PSA 18:18 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Adonai was my support.
PSA 18:19 He brought me out also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
PSA 18:20 Adonai has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
PSA 18:21 For I have kept the ways of Adonai, and have not been condemned as guilty before my God.
PSA 18:22 For all his judgments were before me. I didn’t put away his regulations from me.
PSA 18:23 I was also blameless with him. I kept myself from my depravity (moral evil).
PSA 18:24 Therefore Adonai has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
PSA 18:25 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
PSA 18:26 With the pure, you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
PSA 18:27 For you will save the afflicted people, but the haughty eyes you will bring down.
PSA 18:28 For you will light my lamp, Adonai. My God will light up my darkness.
PSA 18:29 For by you, I advance through a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.
PSA 18:30 As for God, his way is perfect. Adonai’s word is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
PSA 18:31 For who is God, except Adonai? Who is a rock, besides our God,
PSA 18:32 the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
PSA 18:33 He makes my feet like deer’s feet, and sets me on my high places.
PSA 18:34 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
PSA 18:35 You have also given me the shield of your yesha' ·salvation·. Your right hand sustains me. Your gentleness has made me great.
PSA 18:36 You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.
PSA 18:37 I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.
PSA 18:38 I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.
PSA 18:39 For you have armed me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
PSA 18:40 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.
PSA 18:41 They cried, but there was no one to save; even to Adonai, but he didn’t answer them.
PSA 18:42 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
PSA 18:43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
PSA 18:44 As soon as they hear of me they shall sh'ma ·hear obey· me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
PSA 18:45 The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their close places.
PSA 18:46 Adonai lives; and blessed be my rock. Exalted be the God of my yesha' ·salvation·,
PSA 18:47 even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me.
PSA 18:48 He rescues me from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.
PSA 18:49 Therefore I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, Adonai, among the nations, and will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to your name.
PSA 18:50 He gives great yishu'ah ·deliverance· to his king, and shows chesed ·loving-kindness· to his anointed, to David [Beloved] and to his offspring, forever more.
PSA 19:1 The heavens declare the kavod ·weighty glory· of God. The expanse shows his handiwork.
PSA 19:2 Day after day they pour out speech, and night after night they display knowledge.
PSA 19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not sh'ma ·heard obeyed·.
PSA 19:4 Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,
PSA 19:5 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room, like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.
PSA 19:6 His going out is from the end of the heavens, his circuit to its ends; There is nothing hidden from its heat.
PSA 19:7 Adonai’s Torah ·Teaching· is perfect, restoring the soul. Adonai’s testimony is sure, making wise the simple.
PSA 19:8 Adonai’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. Adonai’s mitzvah ·instruction· is pure, enlightening the eyes.
PSA 19:9 The fear of Adonai is clean, enduring forever. Adonai’s judgments are true, and upright altogether.
PSA 19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
PSA 19:11 Moreover by them is your servant warned. In keeping them there is great reward.
PSA 19:12 Who can discern his errors? Forgive me from hidden errors.
PSA 19:13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright. I will be blameless and innocent of great rebellious breach of relationship.
PSA 19:14 Let the words of my mouth and the higgayon ·meditation· of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Adonai, my rock, and my redeemer.
PSA 20:1 May Adonai answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob [Supplanter] set you up on high,
PSA 20:2 send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking],
PSA 20:3 remember all your offerings, and accept your burned sacrifice. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 20:4 May He grant you your heart’s desire, and fulfill all your counsel.
PSA 20:5 We will triumph in your yishu'ah ·salvation·. In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Adonai grant all your requests.
PSA 20:6 Now I know that Adonai saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, with the yesha' ·saving· strength of his right hand.
PSA 20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust the name of Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God].
PSA 20:8 They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright.
PSA 20:9 Save, Adonai! Let the King answer us when we call!
PSA 21:1 The King (Messiah [Anointed one]) rejoices in your strength, Adonai ! How greatly he rejoices in your yishu'ah ·salvation·!
PSA 21:2 You have given him his heart’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 21:3 For you meet him with the blessings of goodness. You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
PSA 21:4 He asked life of you, you gave it to him, even length of days forever and ever.
PSA 21:5 His kavod ·weighty glory· is great in your yishu'ah ·salvation·. You lay honor and majesty on him.
PSA 21:6 For you make him most blessed forever. You make him glad with joy in your presence.
PSA 21:7 For the king trusts in Adonai. Through the chesed ·loving-kindness· of haElyon [the Most High], he shall not be moved.
PSA 21:8 Your hand will find out all of your enemies. Your right hand will find out those who hate you.
PSA 21:9 You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger. Adonai will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire shall devour them.
PSA 21:10 You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from among the children of men.
PSA 21:11 For they intended evil against you. They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.
PSA 21:12 For you will make them turn their back, when you aim drawn bows at their face.
PSA 21:13 Be exalted, Adonai, in your strength, so we will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to your power.
PSA 22:1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from yishu'ah ·delivering· me, and from the words of my groaning?
PSA 22:2 My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer; in the night season, and am not silent.
PSA 22:3 But you are holy, you who inhabit the tehilahot ·praise songs· of Israel [God prevails].
PSA 22:4 Our fathers trusted in you. They trusted, and you delivered them.
PSA 22:5 They cried to you, and were delivered. They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.
PSA 22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised by the people.
PSA 22:7 All who see me jeer at me. They insult me and shake their heads:
PSA 22:8 “He trusts in Adonai ; so let him set him free! Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”
PSA 22:9 But you brought me out of the womb. You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts.
PSA 22:10 I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb. You are my God since my mother bore me.
PSA 22:11 Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near. For there is no one to help.
PSA 22:12 Many bulls have surrounded me. Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.
PSA 22:13 They open their mouths wide against me, lions tearing prey and roaring.
PSA 22:14 I am poured out like water. All my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within me.
PSA 22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd. My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You have brought me into the dust of death.
PSA 22:16 For dogs have surrounded me. A company of villains have enclosed me. They have pierced my hands and feet.
PSA 22:17 I can count all of my bones. They look and stare at me.
PSA 22:18 They divide my garments among them. They cast lots for my clothing.
PSA 22:19 But don’t be far off, Adonai. You are my help: hurry to help me.
PSA 22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog.
PSA 22:21 Save me from the lion’s mouth! Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen, you have answered me.
PSA 22:22 I will declare your name to my brothers. Among the assembly, I will praise you.
PSA 22:23 You who fear Adonai, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob [Supplanter], glorify him! Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel [God prevails]!
PSA 22:24 For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, Neither has he hidden his face from him; but when he cried to him, he sh'ma ·heard obeyed·.
PSA 22:25 Of you comes my tehilah ·praise song· in the great assembly. I will pay my vows before those who fear him.
PSA 22:26 The humble shall eat and be satisfied. They shall praise Adonai who seek after him. Let your hearts live forever.
PSA 22:27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Adonai . All the relatives of the nations shall hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship before you.
PSA 22:28 For the kingdom is Adonai ’s. He is the ruler over the nations.
PSA 22:29 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship. All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him, even he who can’t keep his soul alive.
PSA 22:30 Posterity shall serve him. Future generations shall be told about 'Adonay [Lord].
PSA 22:31 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born, for he has done it.
PSA 23:1 Adonai is my Ro'i [Shepherd Provider]: I shall lack nothing.
PSA 23:2 He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters.
PSA 23:3 He restores my soul. He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
PSA 23:4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
PSA 23:5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over.
PSA 23:6 Surely goodness and chesed ·loving-kindness· shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in Adonai’s house forever.
PSA 24:1 The earth is Adonai ’s, with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein.
PSA 24:2 For he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the floods.
PSA 24:3 Who may ascend to Adonai’s hill? Who may stand in his holy place?
PSA 24:4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully.
PSA 24:5 He shall receive a blessing from Adonai, righteousness from the God of his yesha' ·salvation·.
PSA 24:6 This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face— even Jacob [Supplanter]. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 24:7 Lift up your heads, you gates! Be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the Melek haKavod [King of Weighty glory] will come in.
PSA 24:8 Who is the Melek haKavod [King of Weighty glory]? Adonai strong and mighty, Adonai mighty in battle.
PSA 24:9 Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the Melek haKavod [King of Weighty glory] will come in.
PSA 24:10 Who is this Melek haKavod [King of Glory]? Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is the Melek haKavod [King of Glory]! Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 25:1 א To you, Adonai, do I lift up my soul.
PSA 25:2 בּ My God, I have trusted in you. Don’t let me be shamed. Don’t let my enemies triumph over me.
PSA 25:3 גּ Yes, no one who waits for you shall be shamed. They shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.
PSA 25:4 דּ Show me your ways, Adonai. Teach me your paths.
PSA 25:5 ה Guide me in your truth, and teach me, For you are the God of my yesha' ·salvation·, I wait for you all day long.
PSA 25:6 ז Adonai, remember your tender rachamim ·merciful loves· and your chesed ·loving-kindness·, for they are from old times.
PSA 25:7 ח Don’t remember the habitual sins ·missing the marks· of my youth, nor my rebellious breaches of relationships. Remember me according to your chesed ·loving-kindness·, for your goodness’ sake, Adonai.
PSA 25:8 ט Good and upright is Adonai, therefore he will instruct people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· in the way.
PSA 25:9 י He will guide the humble in mishpat ·justice·. He will teach the humble his way.
PSA 25:10 כּ All the paths of Adonai are chesed ·loving-kindness· and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
PSA 25:11 ל For your name’s sake, Adonai, pardon my depravity (moral evil), for it is great.
PSA 25:12 מ What man is he who fears Adonai? He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.
PSA 25:13 נ His soul shall dwell at ease. His offspring shall inherit the land.
PSA 25:14 ס The friendship of Adonai is with those who fear him. He will show them his covenant.
PSA 25:15 ע My eyes are ever on Adonai, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
PSA 25:16 פ Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted.
PSA 25:17 צ The troubles of my heart are enlarged. Oh bring me out of my distresses.
PSA 25:18 ר Consider my affliction and my travail. Forgive all my habitual sins ·missing the marks·.
PSA 25:19 ר Consider my enemies, for they are many. They hate me with cruel hatred.
PSA 25:20 שׁ Oh keep my soul, and deliver me. Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.
PSA 25:21 תּ Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.
PSA 25:22 Redeem Israel [God prevails], God, out all of his troubles.
PSA 26:1 Judge me, Adonai, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Adonai without wavering.
PSA 26:2 Examine me, Adonai, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind.
PSA 26:3 For your chesed ·loving-kindness· is before my eyes. I have walked in your truth.
PSA 26:4 I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go in with hypocrites.
PSA 26:5 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.
PSA 26:6 I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about your altar, Adonai;
PSA 26:7 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, and tell of all your wondrous deeds.
PSA 26:8 Adonai, I 'ahav ·affectionately love· the habitation of your house, the place where your kavod ·weighty glory· dwells.
PSA 26:9 Don’t gather my soul with people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal·, nor my life with bloodthirsty men;
PSA 26:10 in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes.
PSA 26:11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
PSA 26:12 My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Adonai.
PSA 27:1 Adonai is my light and my yesha' ·salvation·. Whom shall I fear? Adonai is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?
PSA 27:2 When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh, even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
PSA 27:3 Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident.
PSA 27:4 One thing I have asked of Adonai, that I will seek after, that I may dwell in Adonai’s house all the days of my life, to see Adonai’s beauty, and to inquire in his temple.
PSA 27:5 For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion. In the cover of his tabernacle he will hide me. He will lift me up on a rock.
PSA 27:6 Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me. I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent. I will sing, yes, I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai.
PSA 27:7 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Adonai, when I cry with my voice. Have mercy also on me, and answer me.
PSA 27:8 When you said, “Seek my face,” my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Adonai.”
PSA 27:9 Don’t hide your face from me. Don’t put your servant away in anger. You have been my help. Don’t abandon me, neither forsake me, God of my yesha' ·salvation·.
PSA 27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then Adonai will take me up.
PSA 27:11 Teach me your way, Adonai. Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.
PSA 27:12 Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me, such as breathe out cruelty.
PSA 27:13 I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of Adonai in the land of the living.
PSA 27:14 Wait for Adonai. Be strong, and let your heart take courage. Yes, wait for Adonai.
PSA 28:1 To you, Adonai, I call. My rock, don’t be deaf to me; lest, if you are silent to me, I would become like those who go down into the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol).
PSA 28:2 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
PSA 28:3 Don’t draw me away with the wicked, with the workers of vain striving of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts.
PSA 28:4 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. Give them according to the operation of their hands. Bring back on them what they deserve.
PSA 28:5 Because they don’t respect the works of Adonai, nor the operation of his hands, he will break them down and not build them up.
PSA 28:6 Blessed be Adonai, because he has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of my petitions.
PSA 28:7 Adonai is my strength and my shield. My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart greatly rejoices. With my song I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to him.
PSA 28:8 Adonai is their strength. He is a stronghold of yishu'ah ·salvation· to his anointed.
PSA 28:9 Save your people, and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever.
PSA 29:1 Ascribe to Adonai, you sons of the mighty, ascribe to Adonai kavod ·weighty glory· and strength.
PSA 29:2 Ascribe to Adonai the kavod ·weighty glory· due to his name. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship Adonai in holy array.
PSA 29:3 Adonai’s voice is on the waters. The God of kavod ·weighty glory· thunders, even Adonai on many waters.
PSA 29:4 Adonai’s voice is powerful. Adonai’s voice is full of majesty.
PSA 29:5 Adonai’s voice breaks the cedars. Yes, Adonai breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
PSA 29:6 He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox.
PSA 29:7 Adonai’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning.
PSA 29:8 Adonai’s voice shakes the wilderness. Adonai shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
PSA 29:9 Adonai’s voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare. In his temple everything says, “Kavod ·Weighty glory·!”
PSA 29:10 Adonai sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes, Adonai sits as King forever.
PSA 29:11 Adonai will give strength to his people. Adonai will bless his people with peace.
PSA 30:1 I will extol you, Adonai, for you have raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
PSA 30:2 Adonai my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.
PSA 30:3 Adonai , you have brought up my soul from Sheol ·Place of the dead·. You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol).
PSA 30:4 Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai, you saints of his. Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to his holy name.
PSA 30:5 For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning.
PSA 30:6 As for me, I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved.”
PSA 30:7 You, Adonai, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong; but when you hid your face, I was troubled.
PSA 30:8 I cried to you, Adonai. I made supplication to Adonai :
PSA 30:9 “What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit? Shall the dust yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you? Shall it declare your truth?
PSA 30:10 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Adonai, and have mercy on me. Adonai, be my helper.”
PSA 30:11 You have turned my mourning into dancing for me. You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,
PSA 30:12 To the end that my kavod ·weighty glory· may sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you, and not be silent. Adonai my God, I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you forever!
PSA 31:1 In you, Adonai, I take refuge. Let me never be disappointed. Deliver me in your righteousness.
PSA 31:2 Bow down your ear to me. Deliver me speedily. Be to me a strong rock, a house of defense to save me.
PSA 31:3 For you are my rock and my fortress, therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide me.
PSA 31:4 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, for you are my stronghold.
PSA 31:5 Into your hand I commit my spirit. You redeem me, Adonai, God of truth.
PSA 31:6 I hate those who regard lying vanities, but I trust in Adonai.
PSA 31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in your chesed ·loving-kindness·, for you have seen my affliction. You have known my soul in adversities.
PSA 31:8 You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a large place.
PSA 31:9 Have mercy on me, Adonai, for I am in distress. My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.
PSA 31:10 For my life is spent with sorrow, my years with sighing. My strength fails because of my depravity (moral evil). My bones are wasted away.
PSA 31:11 Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors, A fear to my acquaintances. Those who saw me on the street fled from me.
PSA 31:12 I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man. I am like broken pottery.
PSA 31:13 For I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the slander of many, terror on every side, while they conspire together against me, they plot to take away my life.
PSA 31:14 But I trust in you, Adonai. I said, “You are my God.”
PSA 31:15 My times are in your hand. Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.
PSA 31:16 Make your face to shine on your servant. Save me in your chesed ·loving-kindness·.
PSA 31:17 Let me not be disappointed, Adonai, for I have called on you. Let the wicked be disappointed. Let them be silent in Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
PSA 31:18 Let the lying lips be mute, which speak against the upright insolently, with pride and contempt.
PSA 31:19 Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for those who fear you, which you have worked for those who take refuge in you, before the sons of men!
PSA 31:20 In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man. You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues.
PSA 31:21 Praise be to Adonai, for he has shown me his marvelous chesed ·loving-kindness· in a strong city.
PSA 31:22 As for me, I said in my haste, “I am cut off from before your eyes.” Nevertheless you sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of my petitions when I cried to you.
PSA 31:23 Oh 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai, all you his saints! Adonai preserves the faithful, and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.
PSA 31:24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who hope in Adonai.
PSA 32:1 Blessed is he whose rebellious breach of relationship is forgiven, whose cause for sacrifice for sin ·missing the goal· is covered.
PSA 32:2 Blessed is the man to whom Adonai does not impute depravity (moral evil), in whose spirit there is no deceit.
PSA 32:3 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
PSA 32:4 For day and night your hand was heavy on me. My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 32:5 I acknowledged my habitual sin ·missing the mark· to you. I didn’t hide my depravity (moral evil). I said, I will yadah ·extend hands in confession· of my rebellious breaches of relationships to Adonai, and you forgave the depravity (moral evil) of my habitual sin ·missing the mark·. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 32:6 For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found. Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.
PSA 32:7 You are my hiding place. You will preserve me from trouble. You will surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 32:8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go. I will counsel you with my eye on you.
PSA 32:9 Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.
PSA 32:10 Many sorrows come to the wicked, but chesed ·loving-kindness· shall surround him who trusts in Adonai.
PSA 32:11 Be glad in Adonai, and rejoice, you upright! Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
PSA 33:1 Rejoice in Adonai, you upright! Tehilah ·Praise song· is fitting for the upright.
PSA 33:2 Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai with the lyre. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to him with the harp of ten strings.
PSA 33:3 Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully with a shout of joy!
PSA 33:4 For Adonai’s word is right. All his work is done in faithfulness.
PSA 33:5 He 'ahav ·affectionately loves· righteousness and mishpat ·justice·. The earth is full of the chesed ·loving-kindness· of Adonai.
PSA 33:6 By Adonai’s word, the heavens were made; all their army by the breath of his mouth.
PSA 33:7 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
PSA 33:8 Let all the earth fear Adonai. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
PSA 33:9 For he spoke, and it was done. He enjoined, and it stood firm.
PSA 33:10 Adonai brings the counsel of the nations to nothing. He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
PSA 33:11 The counsel of Adonai stands fast forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
PSA 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Adonai, the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.
PSA 33:13 Adonai looks from heaven. He sees all the sons of men.
PSA 33:14 From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,
PSA 33:15 he who fashions all of their hearts; and he considers all of their works.
PSA 33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an army. A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
PSA 33:17 A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither does he deliver any by his great power.
PSA 33:18 Behold, Adonai’s eye is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his loving kindness;
PSA 33:19 to deliver their soul from death, to keep them alive in famine.
PSA 33:20 Our soul has waited for Adonai. He is our help and our shield.
PSA 33:21 For our heart rejoices in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
PSA 33:22 Let your loving kindness be on us, Adonai, since we have hoped in you.
PSA 34:1 א I will bless Adonai at all times. His tehilah ·praise song· will always be in my mouth.
PSA 34:2 בּ My soul shall boast in Adonai. The humble shall sh'ma ·hear obey· it, and be glad.
PSA 34:3 גּ Oh magnify Adonai with me. Let us exalt his name together.
PSA 34:4 דּ I sought Adonai, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.
PSA 34:5 ה They looked to him, and were radiant. Their faces shall never be covered with shame.
PSA 34:6 ז This poor man cried, and Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
PSA 34:7 ח Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.
PSA 34:8 ט Oh taste and see that Adonai is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
PSA 34:9 י Oh fear Adonai, you his saints, for there is no lack with those who fear him.
PSA 34:10 כּ The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek Adonai shall not lack any good thing.
PSA 34:11 ל Come, you children, sh'ma ·hear obey· unto me. I will teach you the fear of Adonai.
PSA 34:12 מ Who of you takes pleasure in living? Who 'ahav ·affectionately loves· a long life to see good things?
PSA 34:13 נ [If you do], keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from deceiving talk;
PSA 34:14 ס turn from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and fervently pursue it!
PSA 34:15 ע For Adonai ’s eyes are toward the upright. His ears listen to their prayers.
PSA 34:16 פּ But Adonai ’s face is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth.
PSA 34:17 צ The upright cry, and Adonai sh'ma ·hears obeys·, and delivers them out of all their troubles.
PSA 34:18 ק Adonai is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit.
PSA 34:19 ר Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Adonai delivers him out of them all.
PSA 34:20 שׁ He protects all of his bones. Not one of them is broken.
PSA 34:21 תּ Evil shall kill the wicked. Those who hate the upright shall be condemned guilty.
PSA 34:22 Adonai redeems the soul of his servants. None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned guilty.
PSA 35:1 Contend, Adonai, with those who contend with me. Fight against those who fight against me.
PSA 35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.
PSA 35:3 Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me. Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”
PSA 35:4 Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor. Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.
PSA 35:5 Let them be as chaff before the wind, Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] driving them on.
PSA 35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery, Adonai’s angel pursuing them.
PSA 35:7 For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me. Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.
PSA 35:8 Let destruction come on him unawares. Let his net that he has hidden catch himself. Let him fall into that destruction.
PSA 35:9 My soul shall be joyful in Adonai. It shall rejoice in his yishu'ah ·salvation·.
PSA 35:10 All my bones shall say, “Adonai, who is like you, who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him; yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”
PSA 35:11 Malicious witnesses come forward. They ask me about things about which I know nothing.
PSA 35:12 They reward me evil for good, to the bereaving of my soul.
PSA 35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. I afflicted my soul with fasting. My prayer teshuvah ·completely returned· into my own bosom.
PSA 35:14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother. I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.
PSA 35:15 But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together. The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it. They tore at me, and didn’t cease.
PSA 35:16 Like the profane mockers in feasts, they gnashed their teeth at me.
PSA 35:17 Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my soul from their destruction, my precious life from the lions.
PSA 35:18 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you in the great assembly. I will praise you among many people.
PSA 35:19 Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.
PSA 35:20 For they don’t speak peace, but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.
PSA 35:21 Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me. They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”
PSA 35:22 You have seen it, Adonai. Don’t keep silent. Lord, don’t be far from me.
PSA 35:23 Wake up! Rise up to my mishpat ·justice· me, my God! My Lord, contend for me!
PSA 35:24 Vindicate me, Adonai my God, according to your righteousness. Don’t let them gloat over me.
PSA 35:25 Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!” Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”
PSA 35:26 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity. Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.
PSA 35:27 Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my upright cause. Yes, let them say continually, “Adonai be magnified, who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!”
PSA 35:28 My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your tehilah ·praise song· all day long.
PSA 36:1 An inner sanctuary is within my heart about the rebellious breach of relationship of the wicked: “There is no fear of Elohim ·Deity, Judge· before his eyes.”
PSA 36:2 For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to detect and hate his depravity (moral evil).
PSA 36:3 The words of his mouth are vain striving of iniquity and deceit. He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
PSA 36:4 He plots vain striving of iniquity on his bed. He sets himself in a way that is not good. He does not abhor evil.
PSA 36:5 Your chesed ·loving-kindness·, Adonai, is in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
PSA 36:6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like a great deep. Adonai, you preserve man and animal.
PSA 36:7 How precious is your chesed ·loving-kindness·, God! The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
PSA 36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.
PSA 36:9 For with you is the spring of life. In your light shall we see light.
PSA 36:10 Oh continue your chesed ·loving-kindness· to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.
PSA 36:11 Don’t let the foot of pride come against me. Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA 36:12 There the workers of vain striving of iniquity are fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
PSA 37:1 א Don’t fret because of evildoers, neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.
PSA 37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither like the green herb.
PSA 37:3 בּ Trust in Adonai, and do good. Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.
PSA 37:4 Also delight yourself in Adonai, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
PSA 37:5 גּ Commit your way to Adonai. Trust also in him, and he will do this:
PSA 37:6 he will make your righteousness go out as the light, and your mishpat ·justice· as the noonday sun.
PSA 37:7 דּ Rest in Adonai, and wait patiently for him. Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.
PSA 37:8 ה Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Don’t fret, it leads only to evildoing.
PSA 37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for Adonai shall inherit the land.
PSA 37:10 ו For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more. Yes, though you look for his place, he is not there.
PSA 37:11 But the humble shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
PSA 37:12 ז The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him with his teeth.
PSA 37:13 'Adonay [Lord] will laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming.
PSA 37:14 ח The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those who are upright on the path.
PSA 37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart. Their bows shall be broken.
PSA 37:16 ט Better is a little that the upright has, than the abundance of many wicked.
PSA 37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Adonai upholds the upright.
PSA 37:18 י Adonai knows the days of the perfect. Their inheritance shall be forever.
PSA 37:19 They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
PSA 37:20 כּ But the wicked shall perish. The enemies of Adonai shall be like the beauty of the fields. They will vanish— vanish like smoke.
PSA 37:21 ל The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back, but the upright give generously.
PSA 37:22 For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land. Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.
PSA 37:23 מ A man’s goings are established by Adonai. He delights in his way.
PSA 37:24 Though he stumble, he shall not fall, for Adonai holds him up with his hand.
PSA 37:25 נ I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the upright forsaken, nor his children begging for bread.
PSA 37:26 All day long he deals graciously, and lends. His offspring is blessed.
PSA 37:27 ס Depart from evil, and do good. Live securely forever.
PSA 37:28 ע For Adonai 'ahav ·affectionately loves· mishpat ·justice·, and does not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA 37:29 The upright shall inherit the land, and live in it forever.
PSA 37:30 פּ The mouth of the upright talks of wisdom. His tongue speaks mishpat ·justice·.
PSA 37:31 The Torah ·Teaching· of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide.
PSA 37:32 צ The wicked watches the upright, and seeks to kill him.
PSA 37:33 Adonai will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him as guilty when he is judged.
PSA 37:34 ק Wait for Adonai, and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
PSA 37:35 ר I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.
PSA 37:36 But he passed away, and behold, he was not. Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.
PSA 37:37 שׁ Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace.
PSA 37:38 As for the rebellious who break away from authority thus breaking relationship, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
PSA 37:39 תּ But the salvation of the upright is from Adonai. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
PSA 37:40 Adonai helps them, and rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in him.
PSA 38:1 Adonai, don’t rebuke me in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
PSA 38:2 For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me.
PSA 38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, neither is there any health in my bones because of my habitual sin ·missing the mark·.
PSA 38:4 For my depravities (moral evils) have gone over my head. As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
PSA 38:5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
PSA 38:6 I am pained and bowed down greatly. I go mourning all day long.
PSA 38:7 For my waist is filled with burning. There is no soundness in my flesh.
PSA 38:8 I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.
PSA 38:9 Lord, all my desire is before you. My groaning is not hidden from you.
PSA 38:10 My heart throbs. My strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.
PSA 38:11 My 'ahav ·affectionate lovers· and my friends stand aloof from my plague. My kinsmen stand far away.
PSA 38:12 They also who seek after my life lay snares. Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all day long.
PSA 38:13 But I, as a deaf man, don’t sh'ma ·hear obey·. I am as a mute man who does not open his mouth.
PSA 38:14 Yes, I am as a man who does not sh'ma ·hear obey·, in whose mouth are no reproofs.
PSA 38:15 For in you, Adonai, do I hope. You will answer, Lord my God.
PSA 38:16 For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”
PSA 38:17 For I am ready to fall. My pain is continually before me.
PSA 38:18 For I will declare my depravity (moral evil). I will be sorry for my habitual sin ·missing the mark·.
PSA 38:19 But my enemies are vigorous and many. Those who hate me without reason are numerous.
PSA 38:20 They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow what is good.
PSA 38:21 Don’t forsake me, Adonai. My God, don’t be far from me.
PSA 38:22 Hurry to help me, Lord, my salvation.
PSA 39:1 I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin ·err (the standard goal)· with my tongue. I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”
PSA 39:2 I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from good. My sorrow was stirred.
PSA 39:3 My heart was hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned: I spoke with my tongue:
PSA 39:4 “Adonai, show me my end, what is the measure of my days. Let me know how frail I am.
PSA 39:5 Behold, you have made my days hand widths. My lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely every man stands as a breath.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 39:6 “Surely every man walks like a shadow. Surely they busy themselves in vain. He heaps up, and does not know who shall gather.
PSA 39:7 Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.
PSA 39:8 Deliver me from all my rebellious breaches of relationships. Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.
PSA 39:9 I was mute. I didn’t open my mouth, because you did it.
PSA 39:10 Remove your scourge away from me. I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
PSA 39:11 When you rebuke and correct man for depravity (moral evil), You consume his wealth like a moth. Surely every man is but a breath.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 39:12 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my prayer, Adonai, and give ear to my cry. Don’t be silent at my tears. For I am a stranger with you, a foreigner, as all my fathers were.
PSA 39:13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go away, and exist no more.”
PSA 40:1 I waited patiently for Adonai. He turned to me, and sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my cry.
PSA 40:2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay. He set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand.
PSA 40:3 He has put a new song in my mouth, even tehilah ·praise song· to our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Adonai.
PSA 40:4 Blessed is the man who makes Adonai his trust, and does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
PSA 40:5 Many, Adonai, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done, and your thoughts which are toward us. They can’t be declared back to you. If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.
PSA 40:6 Sacrifices and offerings you don’t want; burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin ·missing the goal· you have not required. Instead, you have opened my ears.
PSA 40:7 So then I said, “Behold, I have come! In the scroll of a book it is written about me.
PSA 40:8 I delight to do your will, my God. Yes, your Torah ·Teaching· is within my heart.”
PSA 40:9 I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly. Behold, I will not seal my lips, Adonai , you know.
PSA 40:10 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart. I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your chesed ·loving-kindness· and your truth from the great assembly.
PSA 40:11 Don’t withhold your tender rachamim ·merciful loves· from me, Adonai. Let your chesed ·loving-kindness· and your truth continually preserve me.
PSA 40:12 For innumerable evils have surrounded me. My depravities (moral evils) have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up. They are more than the hairs of my head. My heart has failed me.
PSA 40:13 Be pleased, Adonai, to deliver me. Hurry to help me, Adonai.
PSA 40:14 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it. Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.
PSA 40:15 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA 40:16 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let all who 'ahav ·affectionately love· your salvation say continually, “Let Adonai be exalted and magnified!”
PSA 40:17 But I am poor and needy. May 'Adonay [Lord] think about me. You are my help and my deliverer. Don’t delay, my God.
PSA 41:1 Blessed is he who considers the poor. Adonai will deliver him in the day of evil.
PSA 41:2 Adonai will preserve him, and keep him alive. He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.
PSA 41:3 Adonai will sustain him on his sickbed, and restore him from his bed of illness.
PSA 41:4 I said, “Adonai, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· against you.”
PSA 41:5 My enemies speak evil against me: “When will he die, and his name perish?”
PSA 41:6 If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers vain striving of iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.
PSA 41:7 All who hate me whisper together against me. They imagine the worst for me.
PSA 41:8 “An evil disease,” they say, “has afflicted him. Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”
PSA 41:9 Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me.
PSA 41:10 But you, Adonai, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I may repay them.
PSA 41:11 By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.
PSA 41:12 As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
PSA 41:13 Blessed be Adonai , the God of Israel [God prevails], from everlasting and to everlasting! Amen v'Amen ·So be it and So be it·.
PSA 42:1 As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God.
PSA 42:2 My soul thirsts for God, for the Elohim Chayim [Living God]. When shall I come and appear before God?
PSA 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”
PSA 42:4 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.
PSA 42:5 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to him for the yishu'ah ·salvation· of his presence.
PSA 42:6 My God, my soul is in despair within me. Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan [Descender], the heights of Hermon [Devoted to destruction], from the hill Mizar.
PSA 42:7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me.
PSA 42:8 Adonai will enjoin his chesed ·loving-kindness· in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a prayer to the God of my life.
PSA 42:9 I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
PSA 42:10 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”
PSA 42:11 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to him, the yishu'ah ·salvation· of my countenance, and my God.
PSA 43:1 Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.
PSA 43:2 For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA 43:3 Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill, To your tents.
PSA 43:4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy. I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you on the harp, God, my God.
PSA 43:5 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to him: my yishu'ah ·Savior·, my helper, and my God.
PSA 44:1 We have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· with our ears, God; our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the days of old.
PSA 44:2 You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad.
PSA 44:3 For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable to them.
PSA 44:4 You are my King, God. Enjoin yishu'ah ·deliverance· for Jacob [Supplanter]!
PSA 44:5 Through you, will we push down our adversaries. Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up against us.
PSA 44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
PSA 44:7 But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed those who hate us.
PSA 44:8 In God we have made our boast all day long, we will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your name forever. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 44:9 But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don’t go out with our armies.
PSA 44:10 You make us turn back from the adversary. Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.
PSA 44:11 You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.
PSA 44:12 You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing from their sale.
PSA 44:13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.
PSA 44:14 You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.
PSA 44:15 All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face,
PSA 44:16 At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, because of the enemy and the avenger.
PSA 44:17 All this has come on us, yet have we not forgotten you, Neither have we been false to your covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·.
PSA 44:18 Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed from your path,
PSA 44:19 Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA 44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread out our hands to a strange deity;
PSA 44:21 won’t God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
PSA 44:22 Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA 44:23 Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise! Don’t reject us forever.
PSA 44:24 Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction and our oppression?
PSA 44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body clings to the earth.
PSA 44:26 Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your chesed ·loving-kindness’· sake.
PSA 45:1 My heart overflows with a noble theme. I recite my verses for the king. My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.
PSA 45:2 You are the most excellent of the sons of men. Chen ·Grace· has anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you forever.
PSA 45:3 Strap your sword on your thigh, mighty one: your splendor and your majesty.
PSA 45:4 In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness. Let your right hand display awesome deeds.
PSA 45:5 Your arrows are sharp. The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies.
PSA 45:6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever. A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.
PSA 45:7 You have 'ahavta ·affectionately loved· righteousness, and hated ethical wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.
PSA 45:8 All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
PSA 45:9 Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women. At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.
PSA 45:10 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, daughter, consider, and turn your ear. Forget your own people, and also your father’s house.
PSA 45:11 So the king will desire your beauty, honor him, for he is your lord.
PSA 45:12 The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift. The rich among the people entreat your favor.
PSA 45:13 The princess inside is all glorious. Her clothing is interwoven with gold.
PSA 45:14 She shall be led to the king in embroidered work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.
PSA 45:15 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. They shall enter into the king’s palace.
PSA 45:16 Your sons will take the place of your fathers. You shall make them princes in all the earth.
PSA 45:17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you forever and ever.
PSA 46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
PSA 46:2 Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes, though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;
PSA 46:3 though its waters roar and are troubled, though the mountains tremble with their swelling. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 46:4 There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad, the holy place of the tents of haElyon [the Most High].
PSA 46:5 God is within her. She shall not be moved. God will help her at dawn.
PSA 46:6 The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved. He lifted his voice, and the earth melted.
PSA 46:7 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is with us. The God of Jacob [Supplanter] is our refuge. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 46:8 Come, see Adonai’s works, what desolations he has made in the earth.
PSA 46:9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth. He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear. He burns the chariots in the fire.
PSA 46:10 “Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth.”
PSA 46:11 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is with us. The God of Jacob [Supplanter] is our refuge. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 47:1 Oh clap your hands, all you nations. Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
PSA 47:2 For Adonai Most High is awesome. He is a great King over all the earth.
PSA 47:3 He subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet.
PSA 47:4 He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob [Supplanter] whom he 'ahav ·affectionately loved·. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 47:5 God has gone up with a shout, Adonai with the sound of a shofar ·ram horn·.
PSA 47:6 Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to God, sing zahmar ·musical praise·. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to our King, sing zahmar ·musical praise·.
PSA 47:7 For God is the King of all the earth. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· with understanding.
PSA 47:8 God reigns over the nations. God sits on his holy throne.
PSA 47:9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude]. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is greatly exalted!
PSA 48:1 Great is Adonai, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
PSA 48:2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], on the north sides, the city of the great King.
PSA 48:3 In its fortresses God has revealed himself as a strong defense.
PSA 48:4 For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together.
PSA 48:5 They saw it, then they were amazed. They were dismayed. They hurried away.
PSA 48:6 Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail.
PSA 48:7 With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.
PSA 48:8 As we have sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, so we have seen, in the city of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 48:9 We have thought about your chesed ·loving-kindness·, God, in the middle of your temple.
PSA 48:10 As is your name, God, so is your tehilah ·praise song· to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.
PSA 48:11 Let Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] be glad! Let the daughters of Judah [Praised] rejoice, Because of your judgments.
PSA 48:12 Walk about Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and go around her. Number its towers.
PSA 48:13 Mark well her bulwarks. Consider her palaces, that you may tell it to the next generation.
PSA 48:14 For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.
PSA 49:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, all you peoples. Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,
PSA 49:2 both low and high, rich and poor together.
PSA 49:3 My mouth will speak words of wisdom. My heart shall utter understanding.
PSA 49:4 I will incline my ear to a proverb. I will open my riddle on the harp.
PSA 49:5 Why should I fear in the days of evil, when depravity (moral evil) at my heels surrounds me?
PSA 49:6 Those who trust in their wealth, and boast in the multitude of their riches—
PSA 49:7 none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give God a ransom for him.
PSA 49:8 For the redemption of their life is costly, no payment is ever enough,
PSA 49:9 That he should live on forever, that he should not see corruption.
PSA 49:10 For he sees that wise men die; likewise the fool and the senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others.
PSA 49:11 Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever, and their dwelling places to all generations. They name their lands after themselves.
PSA 49:12 But man, despite his riches, does not endure. He is like the animals that perish.
PSA 49:13 This is the destiny of those who are foolish, and of those who approve their sayings. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 49:14 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol ·Place of the dead·. Death shall be their shepherd. The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. Their beauty shall decay in Sheol ·Place of the dead·, far from their mansion.
PSA 49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol ·Place of the dead·, for he will receive me. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 49:16 Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased.
PSA 49:17 For when he dies he shall carry nothing away. His glory shall not descend after him.
PSA 49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul— and men yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you when you do well for yourself—
PSA 49:19 he shall go to the generation of his fathers. They shall never see the light.
PSA 49:20 A man who has riches without understanding, is like the animals that perish.
PSA 50:1 The Mighty One, God, Adonai, speaks, and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.
PSA 50:2 Out of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], the perfection of beauty, God shines out.
PSA 50:3 Our God comes, and does not keep silent. A fire devours before him. It is very stormy around him.
PSA 50:4 He calls to the heavens above, to the earth, that he may judge his people:
PSA 50:5 “Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
PSA 50:6 The heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 50:7 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, my people, and I will speak; Israel [God prevails], and I will testify against you. I am God, your God.
PSA 50:8 I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices. Your burnt offerings are continually before me.
PSA 50:9 I have no need for a bull from your stall, nor male goats from your pens.
PSA 50:10 For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock on a thousand hills.
PSA 50:11 I know all the birds of the mountains. The wild animals of the field are mine.
PSA 50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
PSA 50:13 Will I eat the meat of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
PSA 50:14 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Pay your vows to haElyon [the Most High].
PSA 50:15 Call on me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”
PSA 50:16 But to the wicked God says, “What right do you have to declare my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips,
PSA 50:17 since you hate instruction, and throw my words behind you?
PSA 50:18 When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and have participated with adulterers.
PSA 50:19 “You give your mouth to evil. Your tongue frames deceit.
PSA 50:20 You sit and speak against your brother. You slander your own mother’s son.
PSA 50:21 You have done these things, and I kept silent. You thought that I was just like you. I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.
PSA 50:22 “Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.
PSA 50:23 Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, and prepares his way so that I will show God’s yesha' ·salvation· to him.”
PSA 51:1 Have gracious pity on me, God, according to your chesed ·loving-kindness·. According to the multitude of your tender rachamim ·merciful loves·, blot out my rebellious breaches of relationships.
PSA 51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my depravity (moral evil). Cleanse me from my habitual sin ·missing the mark·.
PSA 51:3 For I know my rebellious breaches of relationships. My habitual sin ·missing the mark· is constantly before me.
PSA 51:4 Against you, and you only, have I sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·, and done that which is evil in your sight; that you may be proved right when you speak, and justified when you judge.
PSA 51:5 Behold, I was born in depravity (moral evil). In crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· my mother conceived me.
PSA 51:6 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
PSA 51:7 Cleanse sin ·err (the standard goal)· from me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA 51:8 Let me sh'ma ·hear obey· joy and gladness, That the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
PSA 51:9 Hide your face from my crimes deserving peanlty, sins ·missing the goal·, and blot out all of my depravities (moral evils).
PSA 51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me.
PSA 51:11 Don’t throw me from your presence, and don’t take your Ruach Kodesh [Holy Spirit, Breath] from me.
PSA 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your yesha' ·salvation·. Uphold me with a willing spirit.
PSA 51:13 Then I will teach the rebellious who break away from authority thus breaking relationship, teach them your ways. People who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· shall be converted to you.
PSA 51:14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation. My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
PSA 51:15 Adonai, open my lips. My mouth shall declare your tehilah ·praise song·.
PSA 51:16 For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
PSA 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
PSA 51:18 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. Build the walls of Jerusalem [City of peace].
PSA 51:19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
PSA 52:1 Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man? God’s chesed ·loving-kindness· endures continually.
PSA 52:2 Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA 52:3 You 'ahavta ·affectionately love· evil more than good, lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 52:4 You 'ahavta ·affectionately love· all devouring words, you deceitful tongue.
PSA 52:5 God will likewise destroy you forever. He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 52:6 The upright also will see it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying,
PSA 52:7 “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”
PSA 52:8 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house. I trust in God’s chesed ·loving-kindness· forever and ever.
PSA 52:9 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you forever, because you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence of your saints.
PSA 53:1 The fool has said in his heart, “There is no Elohim ·Deity, Judge·.” They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity. There is no one who does good.
PSA 53:2 God looks down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there are any who understood, who seek after God.
PSA 53:3 Every one of them has gone back. They have become filthy together. There is no one who does good, no, not one.
PSA 53:4 Have the workers of vain striving of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don’t call on God?
PSA 53:5 There they were in great fear, where no fear was, for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
PSA 53:6 Oh that the yishu'ah ·salvation· of Israel [God prevails] would come out of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]! When God brings back his people from captivity, then Jacob [Supplanter] shall rejoice, and Israel [God prevails] shall be glad.
PSA 54:1 Save me, God, by your name. Vindicate me in your might.
PSA 54:2 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my prayer, God. Listen to the words of my mouth.
PSA 54:3 For strangers have risen up against me. Violent men have sought after my soul. They haven’t set God before them. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 54:4 Behold, God is my helper. 'Adonay [Lord] is the one who sustains my soul.
PSA 54:5 He will repay the evil to my enemies. Destroy them in your truth.
PSA 54:6 With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you. I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your name, Adonai, for it is good.
PSA 54:7 For he has delivered me out of all trouble. My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
PSA 55:1 Listen to my prayer, God. Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.
PSA 55:2 Attend to me, and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
PSA 55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring vain striving of iniquity on me. In anger they hold a grudge against me.
PSA 55:4 My heart is severely pained within me. The terrors of death have fallen on me.
PSA 55:5 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me. Horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA 55:6 I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away, and be at rest.
PSA 55:7 Behold, then I would wander far off. I would lodge in the wilderness.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 55:8 “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”
PSA 55:9 Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA 55:10 Day and night they prowl around on its walls. Vain striving of iniquity and abuse are also within her.
PSA 55:11 Destructive forces are within her. Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.
PSA 55:12 For it was not an enemy who insulted me, then I could have endured it. Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me, then I would have hidden myself from him.
PSA 55:13 But it was you, a man like me, my companion, and my familiar friend.
PSA 55:14 We took sweet fellowship together. We walked in God’s house with company.
PSA 55:15 Let death come suddenly on them. Let them go down alive into Sheol ·Place of the dead·. For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling.
PSA 55:16 As for me, I will call on God. Adonai will save me.
PSA 55:17 Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress. He will sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice.
PSA 55:18 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, although there are many who oppose me.
PSA 55:19 God, who is enthroned forever, will sh'ma ·hear obey·, and humble them. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. They never change, who don’t fear God.
PSA 55:20 He raises his hands against his friends. He has violated his covenant.
PSA 55:21 His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
PSA 55:22 Cast your burden on Adonai, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the upright to be moved.
PSA 55:23 But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in you.
PSA 56:1 Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up. All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.
PSA 56:2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me.
PSA 56:3 When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.
PSA 56:4 In God, I praise his word. In God, I put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?
PSA 56:5 All day long they twist my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA 56:6 They conspire and lurk, watching my steps, they are eager to take my life.
PSA 56:7 Shall they escape by vain striving of iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, God.
PSA 56:8 You count my wanderings. You put my tears into your bottle. Are not they in your book?
PSA 56:9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call. I know this, that God is for me.
PSA 56:10 In God, I will praise his word. In Adonai, I will praise his word.
PSA 56:11 I have put my trust in God. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
PSA 56:12 Your vows are on me, God. I will give thank offerings to you.
PSA 56:13 For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
PSA 57:1 Be merciful to me, God, show favor to me, for my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, until disaster has passed.
PSA 57:2 I cry out to El 'Elyon [God Most High], to God who accomplishes my requests for me.
PSA 57:3 He will send from heaven, and save me, he rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. God will send out his chesed ·loving-kindness· and his truth.
PSA 57:4 My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA 57:5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your kavod ·weighty glory· be above all the earth!
PSA 57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into the middle of it themselves. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 57:7 My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing zahmar ·musical praise·.
PSA 57:8 Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp! I will wake up the dawn.
PSA 57:9 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, Lord, among the peoples. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you among the nations.
PSA 57:10 For your great chesed ·loving-kindness· reaches to the heavens, and your truth to the skies.
PSA 57:11 Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let your kavod ·weighty glory· be over all the earth.
PSA 58:1 Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones? Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?
PSA 58:2 No, in your heart you plot injustice. You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.
PSA 58:3 The wicked go astray from the womb. They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
PSA 58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a snake; like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,
PSA 58:5 which does not sh'ma ·hear obey· the voice of charmers, no matter how skillful the charmer may be.
PSA 58:6 Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Adonai.
PSA 58:7 Let them vanish like water that flows away. When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.
PSA 58:8 Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away, like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.
PSA 58:9 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.
PSA 58:10 The upright shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
PSA 58:11 so that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the upright. Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”
PSA 59:1 Deliver me from my enemies, my God. Set me on high from those who rise up against me.
PSA 59:2 Deliver me from the workers of vain striving of iniquity. Save me from the bloodthirsty men.
PSA 59:3 For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul. The mighty gather themselves together against me, not for my rebellious breach of relationship, nor for my habitual sin ·missing the mark·, Adonai.
PSA 59:4 I have done no depravities (moral evils), yet they are ready to attack me. Rise up, behold, and help me!
PSA 59:5 You, Adonai Elohei Tzva'ot [Yahweh God Commander of heaven’s armies], the God of Israel [God prevails], rouse yourself to punish the nations. Show no mercy to the vain striving of iniquity traitors. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 59:6 They teshuvah ·completely return· at evening, howling like dogs, and prowl around the city.
PSA 59:7 Behold, they spew with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, “For,” they say, “who sh'ma ·hears obeys· us?”
PSA 59:8 But you, Adonai, laugh at them. You scoff at all the nations.
PSA 59:9 Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, for God is my high tower.
PSA 59:10 My God will go before me with his chesed ·loving-kindness·. God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.
PSA 59:11 Don’t kill them, or my people may forget. Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.
PSA 59:12 For the habitual sin ·missing the mark· of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride, for the curses and lies which they utter.
PSA 59:13 Consume them in wrath. Consume them, and they will be no more. Let them know that God rules in Jacob [Supplanter], to the ends of the earth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 59:14 At evening let them teshuvah ·completely return·. Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.
PSA 59:15 They shall wander up and down for food, and wait all night if they are not satisfied.
PSA 59:16 But I will sing of your strength. Yes, I will sing aloud of your chesed ·loving-kindness· in the morning. For you have been my high tower, a refuge in the day of my distress.
PSA 59:17 To you, my strength, I will sing zahmar ·musical praise·. For God is my high tower, the God of my chesed ·loving-kindness·.
PSA 60:1 God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again.
PSA 60:2 You have made the land tremble. You have torn it. Mend its fractures, for it quakes.
PSA 60:3 You have shown your people hard things. You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.
PSA 60:4 You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 60:5 So that your yadid ·beloved· may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us.
PSA 60:6 God has spoken from his sanctuary: “I will triumph. I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Sukkot.
PSA 60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh [Causing to forget] is mine. Ephraim [Fruit] also is the defense of my head. Judah [Praised] is my scepter.
PSA 60:8 Moab [From father] is my wash basin. I will throw my shoe on Edom [Red]. I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA 60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom [Red]?
PSA 60:10 Haven’t you, God, rejected us? You don’t go out with our armies, God.
PSA 60:11 Give us help against the adversary, for the help of man is vain.
PSA 60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly, for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
PSA 61:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my cry, God. Listen to my prayer.
PSA 61:2 From the end of the earth, I will call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA 61:3 For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy.
PSA 61:4 I will dwell in your tent forever. I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 61:5 For you, God, have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
PSA 61:6 You will prolong the king’s life; his years shall be for generations.
PSA 61:7 He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever. Appoint your chesed ·loving-kindness· and truth, that they may preserve him.
PSA 61:8 So I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily.
PSA 62:1 My soul rests in God alone. My yishu'ah ·salvation· comes from him.
PSA 62:2 He alone is my rock and my yishu'ah ·salvation·, my fortress— I will never be greatly shaken.
PSA 62:3 How long will you assault a man, would all of you throw him down, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
PSA 62:4 They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 62:5 My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation is from him.
PSA 62:6 He alone is my rock and my yishu'ah ·salvation·, my fortress. I will not be shaken.
PSA 62:7 With God is my yesha' ·salvation· and my kavod ·weighty glory·. The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
PSA 62:8 Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 62:9 Surely men of low degree are just a breath, and men of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go up. They are together lighter than a breath.
PSA 62:10 Don’t trust in oppression. Don’t become vain in robbery. If riches increase, don’t set your heart on them.
PSA 62:11 God has spoken once; twice I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· this, that power belongs to God.
PSA 62:12 Also to you, Lord, belongs chesed ·loving-kindness·, for you reward every man according to his work.
PSA 63:1 God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.
PSA 63:2 So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power and your kavod ·weighty glory·.
PSA 63:3 Because your chesed ·loving-kindness· is better than life, my lips shall praise you.
PSA 63:4 So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name.
PSA 63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,
PSA 63:6 when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in the night watches.
PSA 63:7 For you have been my help. I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.
PSA 63:8 My soul stays close to you. Your right hand holds me up.
PSA 63:9 But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
PSA 63:10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food.
PSA 63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him will praise him, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
PSA 64:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my voice, God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
PSA 64:2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy crowd of the ones doing vain striving of iniquity;
PSA 64:3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows, deadly words,
PSA 64:4 to shoot innocent men from ambushes. They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.
PSA 64:5 They encourage themselves in evil plans. They talk about laying snares secretly. They say, “Who will see them?”
PSA 64:6 They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!” Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning.
PSA 64:7 But God will shoot at them. They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.
PSA 64:8 Their own tongues shall ruin them. All who see them will shake their heads.
PSA 64:9 All mankind shall be afraid. They shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely ponder what he has done.
PSA 64:10 The upright shall be glad in Adonai, and shall take refuge in him. All the upright in heart shall praise him!
PSA 65:1 Tehilah ·Praise song· waits for you, God, in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. To you shall vows be performed.
PSA 65:2 You who sh'ma ·hear obey· prayer, to you all men will come.
PSA 65:3 Sins and depravities (moral evils) overwhelmed me, but you atoned for our rebellious breaches of relationships.
PSA 65:4 Blessed is one whom you choose, and cause to come near, that he may live in your courts. We will be filled with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
PSA 65:5 By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us, God of our yesha' ·salvation·. You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth, of those who are far away on the sea;
PSA 65:6 Who by his power forms the mountains, having armed yourself with strength;
PSA 65:7 who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
PSA 65:8 They also who dwell in far away places are afraid at your wonders. You call the morning’s dawn and the evening with songs of joy.
PSA 65:9 You visit the earth, and water it. You greatly enrich it. The river of God is full of water. You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it.
PSA 65:10 You drench its furrows. You level its ridges. You soften it with showers. You bless it with a crop.
PSA 65:11 You crown the year with your bounty. Your carts overflow with abundance.
PSA 65:12 The wilderness grasslands overflow. The hills are clothed with gladness.
PSA 65:13 The pastures are covered with flocks. The valleys also are clothed with grain. They shout for joy! They also sing.
PSA 66:1 Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!
PSA 66:2 Make zahmar ·musical praise· to the kavod ·weighty glory· of his name! Offer kavod ·weighty glory· and tehilah ·praise song·!
PSA 66:3 Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds! Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.
PSA 66:4 All the earth will hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship you, and will make zahmar ·musical praise· to you; they will make zahmar ·musical praise· to your name.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 66:5 Come, and see God’s deeds— awesome work on behalf of the children of men.
PSA 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. There, we rejoiced in him.
PSA 66:7 He rules by his might forever. His eyes watch the nations. Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 66:8 Praise our God, you peoples! Make the sound of his tehilah ·praise song· be sh'ma ·heard obeyed·,
PSA 66:9 who preserves our life among the living, and does not allow our feet to be moved.
PSA 66:10 For you, God, have tested us. You have refined us, as silver is refined.
PSA 66:11 You brought us into prison. You laid a burden on our backs.
PSA 66:12 You allowed men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you brought us to the place of abundance.
PSA 66:13 I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. I will pay my vows to you,
PSA 66:14 which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
PSA 66:15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 66:16 Come, and sh'ma ·hear obey·, all you who fear God. I will declare what he has done for my soul.
PSA 66:17 I cried to him with my mouth. He was extolled with my tongue.
PSA 66:18 If I cherished vain striving of iniquity in my heart, 'Adonay [Lord] would not have sh'ma ·heard obeyed·.
PSA 66:19 But most certainly, God has sh'ma ·heard obeyed·. He has heard the voice of my prayer.
PSA 66:20 Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his loving kindness from me.
PSA 67:1 May God be merciful to us, bless us, and cause his face to shine on us. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 67:2 That your way may be known on earth, and your yishu'ah ·salvation· among all nations,
PSA 67:3 let the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, God. Let all the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you.
PSA 67:4 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 67:5 Let the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, God. Let all the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you.
PSA 67:6 The earth has yielded its increase. God, even our own God, will bless us.
PSA 67:7 God will bless us. All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
PSA 68:1 Let God arise! Let his enemies be scattered! Let them who hate him also flee before him.
PSA 68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away. As wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
PSA 68:3 But let the upright be glad. Let them rejoice before God. Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
PSA 68:4 Sing to God! Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to his name! Extol him who rides on the clouds: to Yah, his name! Rejoice before him!
PSA 68:5 A father to orphans, and a defender of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.
PSA 68:6 God sets the lonely in families. He brings out the prisoners with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.
PSA 68:7 God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness... Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 68:8 The earth trembled. The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai— at the presence of God, the God of Israel [God prevails].
PSA 68:9 You, God, sent a plentiful rain. You confirmed your inheritance, when it was weary.
PSA 68:10 Your congregation lived therein. You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.
PSA 68:11 'Adonay [Lord] announced the word. The ones who proclaim it are a great company.
PSA 68:12 “Kings of armies flee! They flee!” She who waits at home divides the plunder,
PSA 68:13 while you sleep among the camp fires, the wings of a dove sheathed with silver, her feathers with shining gold.
PSA 68:14 When Shaddai [Almighty] scattered kings in her, it snowed on Zalmon.
PSA 68:15 The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains. The mountains of Bashan are rugged.
PSA 68:16 Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign? Yes, Adonai will dwell there forever.
PSA 68:17 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands. 'Adonay [Lord] is among them, from Sinai [Thorn], into the sanctuary.
PSA 68:18 You have ascended on high. You have led away captives. You have received gifts among men, yes, among the rebellious also, that Yah God might dwell there.
PSA 68:19 Blessed be 'Adonay [Lord], who daily bears our burdens, even the God who is our yishu'ah ·salvation·. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 68:20 God is to us a God of deliverance. To Adonai, the 'Adonay [Yahweh the Lord], belongs escape from death.
PSA 68:21 But God will strike through the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his faults incurring guilt.
PSA 68:22 'Adonay [Lord] said, “I will bring you again from Bashan, I will bring you again from the depths of the sea;
PSA 68:23 That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.”
PSA 68:24 They have seen your processions, God, even the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
PSA 68:25 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, among the ladies playing with tambourines,
PSA 68:26 “Bless God in the congregations, even 'Adonay [Lord] in the assembly of Israel [God prevails]!”
PSA 68:27 There is little Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south], their ruler, the princes of Judah [Praised], their council, the princes of Zebulun [Living together], and the princes of Naphtali [My wrestling].
PSA 68:28 Your God has enjoined your strength. Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.
PSA 68:29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem [City of peace], kings shall bring presents to you.
PSA 68:30 Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples. Being humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations that delight in war.
PSA 68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.
PSA 68:32 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth! Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai! Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 68:33 To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old; behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.
PSA 68:34 Ascribe strength to God! His excellency is over Israel [God prevails], his strength is in the skies.
PSA 68:35 You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries. The God of Israel [God prevails] gives strength and power to his people. Praise be to God!
PSA 69:1 Save me, God, for the waters have come up to my neck!
PSA 69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
PSA 69:3 I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
PSA 69:4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I am forced to restore what I didn’t steal.
PSA 69:5 God, you know my foolishness. My trespass guilt is not hidden from you.
PSA 69:6 Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, 'Adonay Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]. Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel [God prevails].
PSA 69:7 Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face.
PSA 69:8 I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s children.
PSA 69:9 For the zeal of your house consumes me. The insults of those insulting you have fallen on me.
PSA 69:10 When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.
PSA 69:11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
PSA 69:12 Those who sit in the gate talk about me. I am the song of the drunkards.
PSA 69:13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Adonai, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your yesha' ·salvation·.
PSA 69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.
PSA 69:15 Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up. Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.
PSA 69:16 Answer me, Adonai, for your chesed ·loving-kindness· is good. According to the multitude of your tender rachamim ·merciful loves·, turn to me.
PSA 69:17 Don’t hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!
PSA 69:18 Draw near to my soul, and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.
PSA 69:19 You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before you.
PSA 69:20 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.
PSA 69:21 They also gave me gall for my food. In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA 69:22 Let their table before them become a snare. May it become a retribution and a trap.
PSA 69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see. Let their backs be continually bent.
PSA 69:24 Pour out your indignation on them. Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
PSA 69:25 Let their habitation be desolate. Let no one dwell in their tents.
PSA 69:26 For they persecute him whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.
PSA 69:27 Charge them with depravity (moral evil) upon depravity (moral evil). Don’t let them come into your righteousness.
PSA 69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the upright.
PSA 69:29 But I am in pain and distress. Let your yishu'ah ·salvation·, O God, protect me.
PSA 69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
PSA 69:31 It will please Adonai better than an ox, or a bull that has horns and hoofs.
PSA 69:32 The humble have seen it, and are glad. You who seek after God, let your heart live.
PSA 69:33 For Adonai sh'ma ·hears obeys· the needy, and does not despise his captive people.
PSA 69:34 Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moves therein!
PSA 69:35 For God will save Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and build the cities of Judah [Praised]. They shall settle there, and own it.
PSA 69:36 The children also of his servants shall inherit it. Those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· his name shall dwell therein.
PSA 70:1 Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly to help me, Adonai.
PSA 70:2 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
PSA 70:3 Let them be turned because of their shame Who say, “Aha! Aha!”
PSA 70:4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· your yishu'ah ·salvation· continually say, “Let God be exalted!”
PSA 70:5 But I am poor and needy. Come to me quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Adonai, don’t delay.
PSA 71:1 In you, Adonai, I take refuge. Never let me be disappointed.
PSA 71:2 Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me. Turn your ear to me, and save me.
PSA 71:3 Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go. Give the enjoin to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
PSA 71:4 Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
PSA 71:5 For you are my hope, 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh]; my confidence from my youth.
PSA 71:6 I have relied on you from the womb. You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb. I will always tehilah ·praise song· you.
PSA 71:7 I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge.
PSA 71:8 My mouth shall be filled with your tehilah ·praise song·, with your honor all the day.
PSA 71:9 Don’t reject me in my old age. Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.
PSA 71:10 For my enemies talk about me. Those who watch for my soul conspire together,
PSA 71:11 saying, “God has forsaken him. Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”
PSA 71:12 God, don’t be far from me. My God, hurry to help me.
PSA 71:13 Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed. Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.
PSA 71:14 But I will always hope, and will add to all of your tehilah ·praise song·.
PSA 71:15 My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your salvation all day, though I don’t know its full measure.
PSA 71:16 I will come with the mighty acts of the 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh]. I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.
PSA 71:17 God, you have taught me from my youth. Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.
PSA 71:18 Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me, until I have declared your strength to the next generation, your might to everyone who is to come.
PSA 71:19 Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens; you have done great things. God, who is like you?
PSA 71:20 You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will let me live. You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA 71:21 Increase my honor, and comfort me again.
PSA 71:22 I will also yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God. I sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you with the lyre, haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
PSA 71:23 My lips shall shout for joy! My soul, which you have redeemed, sings zahmar ·musical praise· to you!
PSA 71:24 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long, for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want to harm me.
PSA 72:1 God, give your mishpat ·justice· to the King Messiah [Anointed one]; and your righteousness to the Son of David [Beloved] the King.
PSA 72:2 He will judge your people with righteousness, and your poor afflicted ones with right judgments.
PSA 72:3 The mountains shall bring peace and prosperity to the people. The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.
PSA 72:4 He will judge the poor of the people. He will save the children of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces.
PSA 72:5 They shall fear you, the King Messiah [Anointed one], while the sun endures; and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
PSA 72:6 He will come down like rain on the cut grass of the earth, as showers that water the earth.
PSA 72:7 In his days, the upright shall be multiplied, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.
PSA 72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth.
PSA 72:9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him. His enemies shall lick the dust.
PSA 72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
PSA 72:11 Yes, all kings shall hawa ·bow low, prostrate· before him. All nations shall serve him.
PSA 72:12 For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor, who has no helper.
PSA 72:13 He will have pity on the poor and needy. He will save the souls of the needy.
PSA 72:14 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. Their blood will be precious in his sight.
PSA 72:15 They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba. Men shall pray for him continually. They shall bless him all day long.
PSA 72:16 There shall be an abundance of corn throughout the land. Its fruit sways like Lebanon. Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field outside the city.
PSA 72:17 His name endures forever. His name existed before the creation of the sun. Men shall be blessed by him. All nations will call him blessed.
PSA 72:18 Praise be to Adonai God, the God of Israel [God prevails], who alone does marvelous deeds.
PSA 72:19 Blessed be his kavod ·weighty glorious· name forever! Let the whole earth be filled with his kavod ·weighty glory·! Amen v'Amen ·So be it and So be it·.
PSA 72:20 This ends the prayers by David [Beloved], the son of Jesse [My husband].
PSA 73:1 Surely God is good to Israel [God prevails], to those who are pure in heart.
PSA 73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had nearly slipped.
PSA 73:3 For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA 73:4 For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm.
PSA 73:5 They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men.
PSA 73:6 Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. Violence covers them like a garment.
PSA 73:7 Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
PSA 73:8 They scoff and speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression.
PSA 73:9 They have set their mouth in the heavens. Their tongue walks through the earth.
PSA 73:10 Therefore their people teshuvah ·completely return· to them, and they drink up waters of abundance.
PSA 73:11 They say, “How does God know? Is there knowledge in haElyon [the Most High]?”
PSA 73:12 Behold, these are the wicked. Being always at ease, they increase in riches.
PSA 73:13 Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence,
PSA 73:14 For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.
PSA 73:15 If I had said, “I will speak thus;” behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
PSA 73:16 When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;
PSA 73:17 Until I entered God’s sanctuary, and considered their latter end.
PSA 73:18 Surely you set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction.
PSA 73:19 How they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with terrors.
PSA 73:20 As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.
PSA 73:21 For my soul was grieved. I was embittered in my heart.
PSA 73:22 I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute beast before you.
PSA 73:23 Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand.
PSA 73:24 You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to kavod ·weighty glory·.
PSA 73:25 Whom do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you.
PSA 73:26 My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
PSA 73:27 For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
PSA 73:28 But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
PSA 74:1 God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
PSA 74:2 Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance; Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], in which you have lived.
PSA 74:3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
PSA 74:4 Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.
PSA 74:5 They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a thicket of trees.
PSA 74:6 Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.
PSA 74:7 They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.
PSA 74:8 They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.” They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.
PSA 74:9 We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophet, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.
PSA 74:10 How long, God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
PSA 74:11 Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!
PSA 74:12 Yet God is my King of old, working yishu'ah ·salvation· throughout the earth.
PSA 74:13 You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
PSA 74:14 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.
PSA 74:15 You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers.
PSA 74:16 The day is yours, the night is also yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.
PSA 74:17 You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter.
PSA 74:18 Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Adonai. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.
PSA 74:19 Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.
PSA 74:20 Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.
PSA 74:21 Don’t let the oppressed teshuvah ·completely return· ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.
PSA 74:22 Arise, God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.
PSA 74:23 Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
PSA 75:1 We yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, God. We yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise·, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works.
PSA 75:2 When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.
PSA 75:3 The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 75:4 I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!” I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.
PSA 75:5 Don’t lift up your horn on high. Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”
PSA 75:6 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
PSA 75:7 But God is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another.
PSA 75:8 For in Adonai’s hand there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
PSA 75:9 But I will declare this forever: I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to the God of Jacob [Supplanter].
PSA 75:10 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the upright shall be lifted up.
PSA 76:1 In Judah [Praised], God is known. His name is great in Israel [God prevails].
PSA 76:2 His tabernacle is also in Salem [Complete peace, Perfect peace]; His dwelling place in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
PSA 76:3 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 76:4 Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.
PSA 76:5 Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands.
PSA 76:6 At your rebuke, God of Jacob [Supplanter], both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
PSA 76:7 You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?
PSA 76:8 You pronounced judgment to be sh'ma ·heard obeyed· from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent,
PSA 76:9 when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 76:10 Surely the wrath of man yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained.
PSA 76:11 Make vows to Adonai your God, and fulfill them! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.
PSA 76:12 He will cut off the spirit of princes. He is feared by the kings of the earth.
PSA 77:1 My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him to listen to me.
PSA 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought 'Adonay [Lord]. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.
PSA 77:3 I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 77:4 You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can’t speak.
PSA 77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
PSA 77:6 I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:
PSA 77:7 “Will 'Adonay [Lord] reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?
PSA 77:8 Has his chesed ·loving-kindness· vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?
PSA 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his rachamim ·compassionate loves·?” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 77:10 Then I thought, “I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of haElyon [the Most High].”
PSA 77:11 I will remember Yah’s deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old.
PSA 77:12 I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.
PSA 77:13 Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What deity is great like God?
PSA 77:14 You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.
PSA 77:15 You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob [Supplanter] and Joseph [May he add]. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 77:16 The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.
PSA 77:17 The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.
PSA 77:18 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.
PSA 77:19 Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.
PSA 77:20 You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer].
PSA 78:1 Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA 78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable. I will explain mysteries from days of old,
PSA 78:3 Which we have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· and known, and our fathers have told us.
PSA 78:4 We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the tehilahot ·praise songs· of Adonai, his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.
PSA 78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob [Supplanter], and appointed a teaching in Israel [God prevails], which he enjoined our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;
PSA 78:6 that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,
PSA 78:7 that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his mitzvot ·instructions·,
PSA 78:8 and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
PSA 78:9 The children of Ephraim [Fruit], being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
PSA 78:10 They didn’t keep God’s covenant, and refused to walk in his torot ·teachings·.
PSA 78:11 They forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.
PSA 78:12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], in the field of Zoan.
PSA 78:13 He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.
PSA 78:14 In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.
PSA 78:15 He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
PSA 78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA 78:17 Yet they still went on to sin ·deviate (from the standard goal)· still more against him, to rebel against haElyon [the Most High] in the desert.
PSA 78:18 They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.
PSA 78:19 Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
PSA 78:20 Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?”
PSA 78:21 Therefore Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob [Supplanter], anger also went up against Israel [God prevails],
PSA 78:22 because they didn’t trust in God, and didn’t trust in his yishu'ah ·salvation·.
PSA 78:23 Yet he enjoined the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.
PSA 78:24 He rained down manna ·what is it· on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.
PSA 78:25 Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.
PSA 78:26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.
PSA 78:27 He rained also meat on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.
PSA 78:28 He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations.
PSA 78:29 So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.
PSA 78:30 They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,
PSA 78:31 when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their fattest, and struck down the young men of Israel [God prevails].
PSA 78:32 For all this they still sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·, and didn’t trust in his wondrous works.
PSA 78:33 Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.
PSA 78:34 When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They made teshuvah ·complete return· and sought God earnestly.
PSA 78:35 They remembered that God was their rock, haElyon [the Most High] God, their redeemer.
PSA 78:36 But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
PSA 78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.
PSA 78:38 But he, being merciful, forgave depravity (moral evil), and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath.
PSA 78:39 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and does not come again.
PSA 78:40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!
PSA 78:41 They turned again and tempted God, and provoked haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
PSA 78:42 They didn’t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
PSA 78:43 how he set his signs in Egypt [Abode of slavery], his wonders in the field of Zoan,
PSA 78:44 he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.
PSA 78:45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA 78:46 He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
PSA 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.
PSA 78:48 He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
PSA 78:49 He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.
PSA 78:50 He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
PSA 78:51 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt [Abode of slavery], the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion].
PSA 78:52 But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA 78:53 He led them safely, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA 78:54 He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.
PSA 78:55 He also divorced and drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel [God prevails] to dwell in their tents.
PSA 78:56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against haElyon [the Most High] God, and didn’t keep his testimonies;
PSA 78:57 but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
PSA 78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
PSA 78:59 When God sh'ma ·heard obeyed· this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel [God prevails];
PSA 78:60 So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
PSA 78:61 and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand.
PSA 78:62 He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.
PSA 78:63 Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.
PSA 78:64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep.
PSA 78:65 Then 'Adonay [Lord] awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.
PSA 78:66 He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.
PSA 78:67 Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph [May he add], and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim [Fruit],
PSA 78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah [Praised], Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] which he 'ahav ·affectionately loved·.
PSA 78:69 He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.
PSA 78:70 He also chose David [Beloved] his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
PSA 78:71 from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob [Supplanter], his people, and Israel [God prevails], his inheritance.
PSA 78:72 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
PSA 79:1 God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem [City of peace] in heaps.
PSA 79:2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.
PSA 79:3 Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem [City of peace]. And there was no one to bury them.
PSA 79:4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.
PSA 79:5 How long, Adonai? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
PSA 79:6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you; on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name;
PSA 79:7 For they have devoured Jacob [Supplanter], and destroyed his homeland.
PSA 79:8 Don’t hold the depravities (moral evils) of our forefathers against us. Let your tender rachamim ·merciful loves· speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.
PSA 79:9 Help us, God of our yesha' ·salvation·, for the kavod ·weighty glory· of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our habitual sins ·missing the marks·, for your name’s sake.
PSA 79:10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.
PSA 79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.
PSA 79:12 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.
PSA 79:13 So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you forever. We will tehilah ·praise song· you forever, to all generations.
PSA 80:1 Hear us, Ro'i [Shepherd Provider] of Israel [God prevails], you who lead Joseph [May he add] like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.
PSA 80:2 Before Ephraim [Fruit] and Benjamin [Son of right hand, Son of south] and Manasseh [Causing to forget], stir up your might! Come to bring yishu'ah ·salvation· for us!
PSA 80:3 Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
PSA 80:4 Adonai Elohei Tzva'ot [Yahweh God Commander of heaven’s armies], How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
PSA 80:5 You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.
PSA 80:6 You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.
PSA 80:7 Turn us again, Elohim Tzva'ot [God Commander of heaven’s armies]. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
PSA 80:8 You brought a vine out of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. You divorced and drove out the nations, and planted it.
PSA 80:9 You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.
PSA 80:10 The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God’s cedars.
PSA 80:11 It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
PSA 80:12 Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
PSA 80:13 The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it.
PSA 80:14 Turn again, we beg you, Elohim Tzva'ot [God Commander of heaven’s armies]. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,
PSA 80:15 the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.
PSA 80:16 It’s burned with fire. It’s cut down. They perish at your rebuke.
PSA 80:17 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
PSA 80:18 So we will not turn away from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name.
PSA 80:19 Turn us again, Adonai Elohei Tzva'ot [Yahweh God Commander of heaven’s armies]. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
PSA 81:1 Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob [Supplanter]!
PSA 81:2 Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.
PSA 81:3 Blow the shofar ·ram horn· at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
PSA 81:4 For it is a statute for Israel [God prevails], an judgement of the God of Jacob [Supplanter].
PSA 81:5 He appointed it in Joseph [May he add] for a testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], I sh'ma ·heard obeyed· a language that I didn’t know.
PSA 81:6 “I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket.
PSA 81:7 You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah [Quarreling].” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 81:8 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel [God prevails], if you would listen to me!
PSA 81:9 There shall be no strange deity in you, neither shall you hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship any foreign deity.
PSA 81:10 I am Adonai, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA 81:11 But my people didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice. Israel [God prevails] desired none of me.
PSA 81:12 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels.
PSA 81:13 Oh that my people would sh'ma ·hear obey· me, that Israel [God prevails] would walk in my ways!
PSA 81:14 I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries.
PSA 81:15 The haters of Adonai would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.
PSA 81:16 But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”
PSA 82:1 God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the deities.
PSA 82:2 “How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 82:3 “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
PSA 82:4 Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”
PSA 82:5 They don’t know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
PSA 82:6 I said, “You are elohim ·judges, gods·, all of you are sons of haElyon [the Most High].
PSA 82:7 Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.”
PSA 82:8 Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
PSA 83:1 God, don’t keep silent. Don’t keep silent, and don’t be still, God.
PSA 83:2 For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
PSA 83:3 They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones.
PSA 83:4 “Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel [God prevails] may be remembered no more.”
PSA 83:5 For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you.
PSA 83:6 The tents of Edom [Red] and the Ishmaelites [Pays attention God]; Moab [From father], and the Hagrites;
PSA 83:7 Gebal, Ammon [Tribal people], and Amalek [Man who licks up]; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
PSA 83:8 Assyria [Level plain] also is joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot [Veil, Covering]. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 83:9 Do to them as you did to Midian [Strife], as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
PSA 83:10 who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.
PSA 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
PSA 83:12 who said, “Let us take possession of God’s pasture lands.”
PSA 83:13 My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.
PSA 83:14 As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,
PSA 83:15 so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.
PSA 83:16 Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek your name, Adonai.
PSA 83:17 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish;
PSA 83:18 that they may know that you alone, whose name is Adonai, are haElyon [the Most High] over all the earth.
PSA 84:1 How yadid ·lovely· are your dwellings, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]!
PSA 84:2 My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Adonai. My heart and my flesh cry out for the Elohim Chayim [Living God].
PSA 84:3 Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], my King, and my God.
PSA 84:4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They are always praising you. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 84:5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you; who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.
PSA 84:6 Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
PSA 84:7 They go from strength to strength. Everyone of them appears before God in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
PSA 84:8 Adonai, Elohim Tzva'ot [Yahweh, God Commander of heaven’s armies], sh'ma ·hear obey·, my prayer. Give ear to me, God of Jacob [Supplanter]. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 84:9 Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.
PSA 84:10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of ethical wickedness.
PSA 84:11 For Adonai God is a sun and a shield. Adonai will give chen ·grace· and kavod ·weighty glory·. He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.
PSA 84:12 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], blessed is the man who trusts in you.
PSA 85:1 Adonai, you have been favorable to your land. You have restored the fortunes of Jacob [Supplanter].
PSA 85:2 You have forgiven the depravity (moral evil) of your people. You have covered all their habitual sin ·missing the mark·. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 85:3 You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.
PSA 85:4 Turn us, God of our yesha' ·salvation·, and cause your indignation toward us to cease.
PSA 85:5 Will you be angry with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations?
PSA 85:6 Won’t you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
PSA 85:7 Show us your chesed ·loving-kindness·, Adonai. Grant us your yesha' ·salvation·.
PSA 85:8 I will sh'ma ·hear obey· what God, Adonai, will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn again to folly.
PSA 85:9 Surely his yesha' ·salvation· is near those who fear him, that kavod ·weighty glory· may dwell in our land.
PSA 85:10 Mercy and truth meet together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
PSA 85:11 Truth springs out of the earth. Righteousness has looked down from heaven.
PSA 85:12 Yes, Adonai will give that which is good. Our land will yield its increase.
PSA 85:13 Righteousness goes before him, And prepares the way for his steps.
PSA 86:1 Hear, Adonai, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
PSA 86:2 Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You, my God, save your servant who trusts in you.
PSA 86:3 Show pity on me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.
PSA 86:4 Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PSA 86:5 For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive; abundant in chesed ·loving-kindness· to all those who call on you.
PSA 86:6 Hear, Adonai, my prayer. Listen to the voice of my petitions.
PSA 86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you will answer me.
PSA 86:8 There is no one like you among the deities, Lord, nor any deeds like your deeds.
PSA 86:9 All nations you have made will come and hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship before you, Lord. They shall glorify your name.
PSA 86:10 For you are great, and do wondrous things. You are God alone.
PSA 86:11 Teach me your way, Adonai. I will walk in your truth. Make my heart undivided to fear your name.
PSA 86:12 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, Lord my God, with my whole heart. I will glorify your name forever more.
PSA 86:13 For your chesed ·loving-kindness· is great toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
PSA 86:14 God, the proud have risen up against me. A company of violent men have sought after my soul, and they don’t hold regard for you before them.
PSA 86:15 But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in chesed ·loving-kindness· and truth.
PSA 86:16 Turn to me, and have favor on me! Give your strength to your servant. Save the son of your servant.
PSA 86:17 Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed, because you, Adonai, have helped me, and comforted me.
PSA 87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.
PSA 87:2 Adonai 'ahav ·affectionately loves· the gates of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] more than all the dwellings of Jacob [Supplanter].
PSA 87:3 Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 87:4 I will record Rahab and Babylon [Confusion] among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: “This one was born there.”
PSA 87:5 Yes, of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;” haElyon [the Most High] himself will establish her.
PSA 87:6 Adonai will count, when he writes up the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 87:7 Those who sing as well as those who dance say, “All my springs are in you.”
PSA 88:1 Adonai, the God of my yishu'ah ·salvation·, I have cried day and night before you.
PSA 88:2 Let my prayer enter into your presence. Turn your ear to my cry.
PSA 88:3 For my soul is full of troubles. My life draws near to Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
PSA 88:4 I am counted among those who go down into the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol). I am like a man who has no help,
PSA 88:5 set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more. They are cut off from your hand.
PSA 88:6 You have laid me in the lowest pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol), in the darkest depths.
PSA 88:7 Your wrath lies heavily on me. You have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 88:8 You have taken my friends from me. You have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can’t escape.
PSA 88:9 My eyes are dim from grief. I have called on you daily, Adonai. I have spread out my hands to you.
PSA 88:10 Do you show wonders to the dead? Do the departed spirits rise up and yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you? Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 88:11 Is your chesed ·loving-kindness· declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Abaddon ·Destruction, Unrighteous side of Sheol·?
PSA 88:12 Are your wonders made known in the dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA 88:13 But to you, Adonai, I have cried. In the morning, my prayer comes before you.
PSA 88:14 Adonai, why do you reject my soul? Why do you hide your face from me?
PSA 88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.
PSA 88:16 Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off.
PSA 88:17 They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me.
PSA 88:18 You have put 'ahav ·affectionate lover· and friend far from me, and my friends into darkness.
PSA 89:1 I will sing of the chesed ·loving-kindness· of Adonai forever. With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
PSA 89:2 I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever. You established the heavens. Your faithfulness is in them.”
PSA 89:3 “I have made a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with my chosen one, I have sworn to David [Beloved], my servant,
PSA 89:4 ‘I will establish your offspring forever, and build up your throne to all generations.’” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 89:5 The heavens will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· of your wonders, Adonai; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA 89:6 For who in the skies can be compared to Adonai? Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Adonai,
PSA 89:7 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared above all those who are around him?
PSA 89:8 Adonai, Elohim Tzva'ot [Yahweh, God Commander of heaven’s armies], who is a mighty one, like you? Yah, your faithfulness is around you.
PSA 89:9 You rule the pride of the sea. When its waves rise up, you calm them.
PSA 89:10 You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain. You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
PSA 89:11 The heavens are yours. The earth also is yours; the world and its fullness. You have founded them.
PSA 89:12 The north and the south, you have created them. Tabor and Hermon [Devoted to destruction] rejoice in your name.
PSA 89:13 You have a mighty arm. Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.
PSA 89:14 Righteousness and mishpat ·justice· are the foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before your face.
PSA 89:15 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you. They walk in the light of your presence, Adonai.
PSA 89:16 In your name they rejoice all day. In your righteousness, they are exalted.
PSA 89:17 For you are the glory of their strength. In your favor, our horn will be exalted.
PSA 89:18 For our shield belongs to Adonai; our king to haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
PSA 89:19 Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, “I have given strength to the warrior. I have exalted a young man from the people.
PSA 89:20 I have found David [Beloved], my servant. I have anointed him with my holy oil,
PSA 89:21 with whom my hand shall be established. My arm will also strengthen him.
PSA 89:22 No enemy will tax him. No wicked man will oppress him.
PSA 89:23 I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike those who hate him.
PSA 89:24 But my faithfulness and my chesed ·loving-kindness· will be with him. In my name, his horn will be exalted.
PSA 89:25 I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.
PSA 89:26 He will call to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my yishu'ah ·salvation·!’
PSA 89:27 I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.
PSA 89:28 I will keep my chesed ·loving-kindness· for him forever more. My covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· will stand firm with him.
PSA 89:29 I will also make his offspring endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
PSA 89:30 If his children forsake my Torah ·Teaching·, and don’t walk in my judgments;
PSA 89:31 if they break my regulations, and don’t keep my mitzvot ·instructions·;
PSA 89:32 then I will punish their rebellious breach of relationship with the rod, and their depravity (moral evil) with stripes.
PSA 89:33 But I will not completely take my chesed ·loving-kindness· from him, nor allow my faithfulness to fail.
PSA 89:34 I will not break my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, nor alter what my lips have uttered.
PSA 89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David [Beloved].
PSA 89:36 His offspring will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me.
PSA 89:37 It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 89:38 But you have rejected and spurned. You have been angry with your anointed.
PSA 89:39 You have renounced the covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of your servant. You have defiled his crown in the dust.
PSA 89:40 You have broken down all his hedges. You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
PSA 89:41 All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors.
PSA 89:42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. You have made all of his enemies rejoice.
PSA 89:43 Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven’t supported him in battle.
PSA 89:44 You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down to the ground.
PSA 89:45 You have shortened the days of his youth. You have covered him with shame. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 89:46 How long, Adonai? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire?
PSA 89:47 Remember how short my time is! For what vanity have you created all the children of men!
PSA 89:48 What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol ·Place of the dead·? Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 89:49 Lord, where are your former chesed ·loving-kindnesses·, which you swore to David [Beloved] in your faithfulness?
PSA 89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,
PSA 89:51 With which your enemies have mocked, Adonai , with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.
PSA 89:52 Blessed be Adonai forever more. Amen v'Amen ·So be it and So be it·.
PSA 90:1 Lord, you have been our dwelling place for all generations.
PSA 90:2 Before the mountains were born, before you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
PSA 90:3 You turn man to destruction, saying, “Teshuvah ·Completely return·, you children of men.”
PSA 90:4 For a thousand years in your sight are just like yester day, or a night watch.
PSA 90:5 You sweep them away as they sleep. In the morning they sprout like new grass.
PSA 90:6 In the morning it sprouts and springs up. By evening, it is withered and dry.
PSA 90:7 For we are consumed in your anger. We are troubled in your wrath.
PSA 90:8 You have set our depravities (moral evils) before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
PSA 90:9 For all our days have passed away in your wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
PSA 90:10 The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and vain striving of iniquity, for it passes quickly, and we fly away.
PSA 90:11 Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?
PSA 90:12 So teach us to count our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
PSA 90:13 Relent, Adonai! How long? Have compassion on your servants!
PSA 90:14 Satisfy us in the morning with your chesed ·loving-kindness·, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
PSA 90:15 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.
PSA 90:16 Let your work appear to your servants; your glory to their children.
PSA 90:17 Let the favor of Yahweh our God be on us; establish the work of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands.
PSA 91:1 He who dwells in the secret place of haElyon [the Most High] will rest in the shadow of Shaddai [Almighty].
PSA 91:2 I will say of Adonai, “He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.”
PSA 91:3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.
PSA 91:4 He will cover you with his feathers. Under his wings you will take refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
PSA 91:5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day;
PSA 91:6 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.
PSA 91:7 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you.
PSA 91:8 You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense of the wicked.
PSA 91:9 Because you have made Adonai your refuge, and haElyon [the Most High] your dwelling place,
PSA 91:10 no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.
PSA 91:11 For he will enjoin his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.
PSA 91:12 They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.
PSA 91:13 You will tread on the lion and cobra. You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
PSA 91:14 “Because he has set his chasak ·to set one’s affection, to make bands· on me, therefore I will deliver him. I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
PSA 91:15 He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.
PSA 91:16 I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my yishu'ah ·salvation·.”
PSA 92:1 It is a good thing to yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai, to sing zahmar ·musical praise· to your name, Most High;
PSA 92:2 to proclaim your chesed ·loving-kindness· in the morning, and your faithfulness every night,
PSA 92:3 with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the lyre's solemn higgayon ·meditation·.
PSA 92:4 For you, Adonai, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.
PSA 92:5 How great are your works, Adonai! Your thoughts are very deep.
PSA 92:6 A senseless man does not know, neither does a fool understand this:
PSA 92:7 though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all those who practice vain striving of iniquity flourish, they will be destroyed forever.
PSA 92:8 But you, Adonai, are on high forever more.
PSA 92:9 For, behold, your enemies, Adonai, for, behold, your enemies shall perish. All those who practice vain striving of iniquity will be scattered.
PSA 92:10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil.
PSA 92:11 My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.
PSA 92:12 The upright shall flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA 92:13 They are planted in Adonai’s house. They will flourish in our God’s courts.
PSA 92:14 They will still produce fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green,
PSA 92:15 to show that Adonai is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
PSA 93:1 Adonai reigns! He is clothed with majesty! Adonai is armed with strength. The world also is established. It can’t be moved.
PSA 93:2 Your throne is established from long ago. You are from everlasting.
PSA 93:3 The floods have lifted up, Adonai, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their waves.
PSA 93:4 Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Adonai on high is mighty.
PSA 93:5 Your testimonies stand firm. Holiness adorns your house, Adonai, forever more.
PSA 94:1 Adonai, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom vengeance belongs, shine out.
PSA 94:2 Rise up, you judge of the earth. Pay back the proud what they deserve.
PSA 94:3 Adonai, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?
PSA 94:4 They pour out arrogant words. All those who practice vain striving of iniquity boast.
PSA 94:5 They break your people in pieces, Adonai, and afflict your heritage.
PSA 94:6 They kill the widow and the alien, and murder the fatherless.
PSA 94:7 They say, “Yah will not see, neither will Jacob [Supplanter]’s God consider.”
PSA 94:8 Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools, when will you be wise?
PSA 94:9 He who implanted the ear, won’t he sh'ma ·hear obey·? He who formed the eye, won’t he see?
PSA 94:10 He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish? He who teaches man knows.
PSA 94:11 Adonai knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
PSA 94:12 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out of your Torah ·Teaching·;
PSA 94:13 that you may give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.
PSA 94:14 For Adonai won’t reject his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
PSA 94:15 For judgment will teshuvah ·completely return· to righteousness. All the upright in heart shall follow it.
PSA 94:16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against those who practice vain striving of iniquity?
PSA 94:17 Unless Adonai had been my help, my soul would have soon lived in silence.
PSA 94:18 When I said, “My foot is slipping!” Your chesed ·loving-kindness·, Adonai, held me up.
PSA 94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul.
PSA 94:20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, which brings about mischief by statute?
PSA 94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the upright, and condemn as guilty the innocent blood.
PSA 94:22 But Adonai has been my high tower, my God, the rock of my refuge.
PSA 94:23 He has brought on them their own vain striving of iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Adonai, our God, will cut them off.
PSA 95:1 Oh come, let’s sing to Adonai. Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our yesha' ·salvation·!
PSA 95:2 Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let’s extol him with songs!
PSA 95:3 For Adonai is a great God, a great King above all deities.
PSA 95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his.
PSA 95:5 The sea is his, and he made it. His hands formed the dry land.
PSA 95:6 Oh come, let’s worship and hawa ·bow low, prostrate·. Let’s kneel before Yahweh 'Oseinu [Yahweh our Maker],
PSA 95:7 for he is our God. We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep in his care. Today, oh that you would sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice!
PSA 95:8 Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah [Quarreling], as in the day of Massah [Testing] in the wilderness,
PSA 95:9 when your fathers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work.
PSA 95:10 Forty long years I loathed that generation, and said, “This is a people that errors in their heart. They have not known my ways.”
PSA 95:11 Therefore I swore in my wrath, “They won’t enter into my rest.”
PSA 96:1 Sing to Adonai a new song! Sing to Adonai, all the earth.
PSA 96:2 Sing to Adonai! Bless his name! Proclaim his yishu'ah ·salvation· from day to day!
PSA 96:3 Declare his kavod ·weighty glory· among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
PSA 96:4 For great is Adonai, and greatly to be praised! He is to be feared above all deities.
PSA 96:5 For all the deities of the peoples are idols, but Adonai made the heavens.
PSA 96:6 Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
PSA 96:7 Ascribe to Adonai, you families of nations, ascribe to Adonai kavod ·weighty glory· and strength.
PSA 96:8 Ascribe to Adonai the kavod ·weighty glory· due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
PSA 96:9 Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship Adonai in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth.
PSA 96:10 Say among the nations, “Adonai reigns.” The world is also established. It can’t be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity.
PSA 96:11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
PSA 96:12 Let the field and all that is in it exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy
PSA 96:13 before Adonai; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples with his truth.
PSA 97:1 Adonai reigns! Let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of islands be glad!
PSA 97:2 Clouds and darkness are around him. Righteousness and mishpat ·justice· are the foundation of his throne.
PSA 97:3 A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries on every side.
PSA 97:4 His lightning lights up the world. The earth sees, and trembles.
PSA 97:5 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Adonai, at the presence of 'Adon [Lord] of the whole earth.
PSA 97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness. All the peoples have seen his kavod ·weighty glory·.
PSA 97:7 Let all them be shamed who abad ·serve· engraved images, who boast in their idols. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship him, all you angels!
PSA 97:8 Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] sh'ma ·heard obeyed· and was glad. The daughters of Judah [Praised] rejoiced, because of your judgments, Adonai.
PSA 97:9 For you, Adonai, are most high above all the earth. You are exalted far above all deities.
PSA 97:10 You who 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai, hate evil. He preserves the souls of his saints. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
PSA 97:11 Light is sown for the upright, and gladness for the upright in heart.
PSA 97:12 Be glad in Adonai, you upright people! Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to his holy Name.
PSA 98:1 Sing to Adonai a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand, and his holy arm, have worked salvation for him.
PSA 98:2 Adonai has made known his yishu'ah ·salvation·. He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
PSA 98:3 He has remembered his chesed ·loving-kindness· and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel [God prevails]. All the ends of the earth have seen the yishu'ah ·salvation· of our God.
PSA 98:4 Make a joyful noise to Adonai, all the earth! Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing zahmar ·musical praise·!
PSA 98:5 Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody.
PSA 98:6 With trumpets and sound of the shofar ·ram horn·, make a joyful noise before the King, Adonai.
PSA 98:7 Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein.
PSA 98:8 Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the mountains sing for joy together.
PSA 98:9 Let them sing before Adonai, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
PSA 99:1 Adonai reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved.
PSA 99:2 Adonai is great in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. He is high above all the peoples.
PSA 99:3 Let them yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your great and awesome name. He is Holy!
PSA 99:4 The King’s strength also 'ahav ·affectionately loves· mishpat ·justice·. You do establish equity. You execute mishpat ·justice· and righteousness in Jacob [Supplanter].
PSA 99:5 Exalt Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God]. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship at his footstool. He is Holy!
PSA 99:6 Moses [Drawn out] and Aaron [Light-bringer] were among his priests, Samuel among those who call on his name; they called on Adonai, and he answered them.
PSA 99:7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, the statute that he gave them.
PSA 99:8 You answered them, Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God]. You are a God who forgave them, although you took vengeance for their doings.
PSA 99:9 Exalt Adonai, our God. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship at his holy hill, for Adonai, our God, is holy!
PSA 100:1 Shout for joy to Adonai, all you lands!
PSA 100:2 Abad ·Serve· Adonai with gladness. Come before his presence with singing.
PSA 100:3 Know that Adonai, he is God. It is he who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
PSA 100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with tehilahot ·praise songs·. Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to him, and bless his name.
PSA 100:5 For Adonai is good. His chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever, his faithfulness to all generations.
PSA 101:1 I will sing of chesed ·loving-kindness· and mishpat ·justice·. To you, Adonai, I will sing zahmar ·musical praise·.
PSA 101:2 I will be careful to live a blameless life. When will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
PSA 101:3 I will set no vile thing before my eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless men. They will not cling to me.
PSA 101:4 A perverse heart will be far from me. I will have nothing to do with evil.
PSA 101:5 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor. I won’t tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.
PSA 101:6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.
PSA 101:7 He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes.
PSA 101:8 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of vain striving of iniquity from Adonai’s city.
PSA 102:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my prayer, Adonai ! Let my cry come to you.
PSA 102:2 Don’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Turn your ear to me. Answer me quickly in the day when I call.
PSA 102:3 For my days consume away like smoke. My bones are burned as a torch.
PSA 102:4 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget to eat my bread.
PSA 102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin.
PSA 102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I have become as an owl of the waste places.
PSA 102:7 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.
PSA 102:8 My enemies reproach me all day. Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.
PSA 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears,
PSA 102:10 Because of your indignation and your wrath, for you have taken me up, and thrown me away.
PSA 102:11 My days are like a long shadow. I have withered like grass.
PSA 102:12 But you, Adonai, will remain forever; your renown endures to all generations.
PSA 102:13 You will arise and have racham ·merciful love· on Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]; for it is time to have mercy on her. Yes, the set time has come.
PSA 102:14 For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity even on her dust.
PSA 102:15 So the nations will fear Adonai’s name; all the kings of the earth your kavod ·weighty glory·.
PSA 102:16 For Adonai has built up Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. He has appeared in his kavod ·weighty glory·.
PSA 102:17 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer.
PSA 102:18 This will be written for the generation to come. A people which will be created will Halleluyah ·praise Yah·.
PSA 102:19 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven, Adonai saw the earth;
PSA 102:20 to sh'ma ·hear obey· the groans of the prisoner; to free those who are condemned to death;
PSA 102:21 that men may declare Adonai’s name in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and his tehilah ·praise song· in Jerusalem [City of peace];
PSA 102:22 when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms, to serve Adonai.
PSA 102:23 He weakened my strength along the course. He shortened my days.
PSA 102:24 I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the middle of my days. Your years are throughout all generations.
PSA 102:25 Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the work of your hands.
PSA 102:26 They will perish, but you will endure. Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. You will change them like a cloak, and they will pass away.
PSA 102:27 But you remain the same, your years will have no end.
PSA 102:28 The children of your servants will continue. Their offspring will be established before you.”
PSA 103:1 Praise Adonai, my soul! All that is within me, praise his holy name!
PSA 103:2 Praise Adonai , my soul, and don’t forget all his benefits;
PSA 103:3 who forgives all your depravities (moral evils); who heals all your diseases;
PSA 103:4 who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with chesed ·loving-kindness· and tender rachamim ·merciful loves·;
PSA 103:5 who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
PSA 103:6 Adonai executes righteous acts, and mishpat ·justice· for all who are oppressed.
PSA 103:7 He made known his ways to Moses [Drawn out], his deeds to the children of Israel [God prevails].
PSA 103:8 Adonai is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in chesed ·loving-kindness·.
PSA 103:9 He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever.
PSA 103:10 He has not dealt with us according to our crimes deserving peanlty, sins ·missing the goal·, nor repaid us for our depravities (moral evils).
PSA 103:11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his chesed ·loving-kindness· toward those who fear him.
PSA 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our rebellious breaches of relationships from us.
PSA 103:13 Like a father has racham ·compassionate merciful love· on his children, so Adonai has racham ·compassionate merciful love· on those who fear him.
PSA 103:14 For he knows how we are made. He remembers that we are dust.
PSA 103:15 As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
PSA 103:16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more.
PSA 103:17 But Adonai’s chesed ·loving-kindness· is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, his righteousness to children’s children;
PSA 103:18 to those who keep his covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, to those who remember to obey his precepts.
PSA 103:19 Adonai has established his throne in the heavens. His kingdom rules over all.
PSA 103:20 Praise Adonai, you angels of his, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, Sh'ma ·hearing obeying· the voice of his word.
PSA 103:21 Praise Adonai, all you armies of his, you servants of his, who do his pleasure.
PSA 103:22 Praise Adonai, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion. Praise Adonai, my soul!
PSA 104:1 Bless Adonai, my soul. Adonai, my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty.
PSA 104:2 He covers himself with light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.
PSA 104:3 He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters. He makes the clouds his chariot. He walks on the wings of the wind.
PSA 104:4 He makes his messengers winds; his servants flames of fire.
PSA 104:5 He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever.
PSA 104:6 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. The waters stood above the mountains.
PSA 104:7 At your rebuke they fled. At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.
PSA 104:8 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you had assigned to them.
PSA 104:9 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over; that they don’t turn again to cover the earth.
PSA 104:10 He sends springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.
PSA 104:11 They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
PSA 104:12 The birds of the sky nest by them. They sing among the branches.
PSA 104:13 He waters the mountains from his rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.
PSA 104:14 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man to cultivate, that he may produce food out of the earth:
PSA 104:15 wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengthens man’s heart.
PSA 104:16 Adonai’s trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;
PSA 104:17 where the birds make their nests. The stork makes its home in the cypress trees.
PSA 104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.
PSA 104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set.
PSA 104:20 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl.
PSA 104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.
PSA 104:22 The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens.
PSA 104:23 Man goes out to his work, to his labor until the evening.
PSA 104:24 Adonai, how many are your works! In wisdom have you made them all. The earth is full of your riches.
PSA 104:25 There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals.
PSA 104:26 There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.
PSA 104:27 These all wait for you, that you may give them their food in due season.
PSA 104:28 You give to them; they gather. You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.
PSA 104:29 You hide your face: they are troubled; you take away their breath: they die, and teshuvah ·completely return· to the dust.
PSA 104:30 You send out your breath mind Spirit and they are created. You renew the face of the ground.
PSA 104:31 Let the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· endure forever. Let Adonai rejoice in his works.
PSA 104:32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
PSA 104:33 I will sing to Adonai as long as I live. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to my God while I have any being.
PSA 104:34 Let your meditation be sweet to him. I will rejoice in Adonai.
PSA 104:35 Let people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· be consumed out of the earth. Let the wicked be no more. Bless Adonai, my soul. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 105:1 Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai! Call on his name! Make his doings known among the peoples.
PSA 105:2 Sing to him, sing zahmar ·musical praise· to him! Tell of all his marvelous works.
PSA 105:3 Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Adonai rejoice.
PSA 105:4 Seek Adonai and his strength. Seek his face forever more.
PSA 105:5 Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
PSA 105:6 you offspring of Abraham [Father of a multitude], his servant, you children of Jacob [Supplanter], his chosen ones.
PSA 105:7 He is Adonai, our God. His judgments are in all the earth.
PSA 105:8 He has remembered his covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· forever, the word which he enjoined to a thousand generations,
PSA 105:9 the covenant which he made with Abraham [Father of a multitude], his oath to Isaac [Laughter],
PSA 105:10 and confirmed the same to Jacob [Supplanter] for a statute; to Israel [God prevails] for an everlasting covenant,
PSA 105:11 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan [Humbled], the lot of your inheritance;”
PSA 105:12 when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it.
PSA 105:13 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.
PSA 105:14 He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,
PSA 105:15 “Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!”
PSA 105:16 He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.
PSA 105:17 He sent a man before them. Joseph [May he add] was sold for a slave.
PSA 105:18 They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,
PSA 105:19 until the time that his word happened, and Adonai’s word proved him true.
PSA 105:20 The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
PSA 105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions;
PSA 105:22 to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.
PSA 105:23 Israel [God prevails] also came into Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Jacob [Supplanter] lived in the land of Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion].
PSA 105:24 He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.
PSA 105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.
PSA 105:26 He sent Moses [Drawn out], his servant, and Aaron [Light-bringer], whom he had chosen.
PSA 105:27 They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion].
PSA 105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn’t rebel against his words.
PSA 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
PSA 105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the rooms of their kings.
PSA 105:31 He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.
PSA 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.
PSA 105:33 He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
PSA 105:34 He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,
PSA 105:35 ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit of their ground.
PSA 105:36 He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood.
PSA 105:37 He brought them out with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes.
PSA 105:38 Egypt [Abode of slavery] was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them.
PSA 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.
PSA 105:40 They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.
PSA 105:41 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.
PSA 105:42 For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham [Father of a multitude], his servant.
PSA 105:43 He brought his people out with joy, his chosen with singing.
PSA 105:44 He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,
PSA 105:45 that they might keep his statutes, and observe his torot ·teachings·. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 106:1 Praise Adonai! Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai, for he is good, for his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of Adonai, or sh'ma ·hear obey, fully declare· all his praise?
PSA 106:3 Blessed are those who keep mishpat ·justice·. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.
PSA 106:4 Remember me, Adonai, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your yishu'ah ·salvation·,
PSA 106:5 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.
PSA 106:6 We have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)· with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have been condemned as guilty.
PSA 106:7 Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt [Abode of slavery]. They didn’t remember the multitude of your chesed ·loving-kindnesses·, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea].
PSA 106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power known.
PSA 106:9 He rebuked the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea] also, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.
PSA 106:10 He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA 106:11 The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.
PSA 106:12 Then they trusted his words. They sang his tehilah ·praise song·.
PSA 106:13 They soon forgot his works. They didn’t wait for his counsel,
PSA 106:14 but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland.
PSA 106:15 He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
PSA 106:16 They envied Moses [Drawn out] also in the camp, and Aaron [Light-bringer], Adonai’s saint.
PSA 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
PSA 106:18 A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.
PSA 106:19 They made a calf in Horeb [Desert], and hawa ·bowed low, prostrated· worshiped a molten image.
PSA 106:20 Thus they exchanged their kavod ·weighty glory· for an image of a bull that eats grass.
PSA 106:21 They forgot God, their source of salvation, who had done great things in Egypt [Abode of slavery],
PSA 106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham [Hot, Intensity, Passion], and awesome things by the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea].
PSA 106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses [Drawn out], his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, so that he would not destroy them.
PSA 106:24 Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn’t trust his word,
PSA 106:25 but murmured in their tents, and didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai’s voice.
PSA 106:26 Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
PSA 106:27 that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.
PSA 106:28 They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
PSA 106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.
PSA 106:30 Then Pinchas [Bronze skin] stood up, and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.
PSA 106:31 That was credited to him for righteousness, for all generations to come.
PSA 106:32 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah [Quarreling], so that Moses [Drawn out] was troubled for their sakes;
PSA 106:33 because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips.
PSA 106:34 They didn’t destroy the peoples, as Adonai ordered them to do,
PSA 106:35 but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
PSA 106:36 They abad ·served· their idols, which became a snare to them.
PSA 106:37 Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
PSA 106:38 They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan [Humbled]. The land was polluted with blood.
PSA 106:39 Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.
PSA 106:40 Therefore Adonai burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.
PSA 106:41 He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA 106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA 106:43 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their depravity (moral evil).
PSA 106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· their cry.
PSA 106:45 He remembered for them his covenant, and relented according to the multitude of his chesed ·loving-kindnesses·.
PSA 106:46 He made them also to be shown rachamim ·compassionate loves· by all those who carried them captive.
PSA 106:47 Save us, Adonai, our God, gather us from among the nations, yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your holy name, to triumph in your tehilah ·praise song·!
PSA 106:48 Blessed be Adonai, the God of Israel [God prevails], from everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, “Amen ·So be it·.” Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 107:1 Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai, for he is good, for his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 107:2 Let the redeemed by Adonai say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
PSA 107:3 And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
PSA 107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.
PSA 107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
PSA 107:6 Then they cried to Adonai in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses,
PSA 107:7 he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in.
PSA 107:8 Let them yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai for his chesed ·loving-kindness·, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
PSA 107:9 For he satisfies the longing soul. He fills the hungry soul with good.
PSA 107:10 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,
PSA 107:11 because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned the counsel of haElyon [the Most High].
PSA 107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was no one to help.
PSA 107:13 Then they cried to Adonai in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
PSA 107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke away their chains.
PSA 107:15 Let them yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai for his chesed ·loving-kindness·, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
PSA 107:16 For he has broken the gates of bronze, and cut through bars of iron.
PSA 107:17 Fools are afflicted because of their rebellious breach of relationship, and because of their depravities (moral evils).
PSA 107:18 Their soul abhors all kinds of food. They draw near to the gates of death.
PSA 107:19 Then they cry to Adonai in their trouble, he saves them out of their distresses.
PSA 107:20 He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them from their graves.
PSA 107:21 Let them yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai for his chesed ·loving-kindness·, for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!
PSA 107:22 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his deeds with singing.
PSA 107:23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters;
PSA 107:24 These see Adonai’s deeds, and his wonders in the deep.
PSA 107:25 For at his word the stormy wind arose, lifting up its towering waves.
PSA 107:26 They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.
PSA 107:27 They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.
PSA 107:28 Then they cry to Adonai in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distress.
PSA 107:29 He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
PSA 107:30 Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them to their desired haven.
PSA 107:31 Let them yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai for his chesed ·loving-kindness·, for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!
PSA 107:32 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders.
PSA 107:33 He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
PSA 107:34 and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
PSA 107:35 He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.
PSA 107:36 There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city to live in,
PSA 107:37 sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
PSA 107:38 He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He does not allow their livestock to decrease.
PSA 107:39 Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
PSA 107:40 He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
PSA 107:41 Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like a flock.
PSA 107:42 The upright will see it, and be glad. All the wicked will shut their mouths.
PSA 107:43 Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. They will consider the chesed ·loving-kindnesses· of Adonai.
PSA 108:1 My heart is steadfast, God. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· and I will give kavod ·weighty glory·.
PSA 108:2 Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn.
PSA 108:3 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, Adonai, among the nations. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you among the peoples.
PSA 108:4 For your chesed ·loving-kindness· is great above the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
PSA 108:5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your kavod ·weighty glory· be over all the earth.
PSA 108:6 That your yadid ·beloved· may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us.
PSA 108:7 God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Sukkot.
PSA 108:8 Gilead is mine. Manasseh [Causing to forget] is mine. Ephraim [Fruit] also is my helmet. Judah [Praised] is my scepter.
PSA 108:9 Moab [From father] is my wash pot. I will toss my sandal on Edom [Red]. I will shout over Philistia.”
PSA 108:10 Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom [Red]?
PSA 108:11 Haven’t you rejected us, God? You don’t go out, God, with our armies.
PSA 108:12 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain.
PSA 108:13 Through God, we will do valiantly. For it is he who will tread down our enemies.
PSA 109:1 God of my tehilah ·praise song·, don’t remain silent,
PSA 109:2 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me. They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
PSA 109:3 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
PSA 109:4 Making teshuvah ·complete return· for my love, they are my adversaries; but I am in prayer.
PSA 109:5 They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
PSA 109:6 Set a wicked man over him. Let an adversary stand at his right hand.
PSA 109:7 When he is judged, let him come out guilty. Let his prayer be turned into cause for sacrifice for sin ·missing the goal·.
PSA 109:8 Let his days be few. Let another take his office.
PSA 109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
PSA 109:10 Let his children be wandering beggars. Let them be sought from their ruins.
PSA 109:11 Let the creditor seize all that he has. Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.
PSA 109:12 Let there be no one to extend kindness to him, neither let there be anyone to have pity on his orphan children.
PSA 109:13 Let his posterity be cut off. In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
PSA 109:14 Let the depravity (moral evil) of his fathers be remembered by Adonai. Don’t let the habitual sin ·missing the mark· of his mother be blotted out.
PSA 109:15 Let them be before Adonai continually, that he may cut off their memory from the earth;
PSA 109:16 because he didn’t remember to show kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.
PSA 109:17 Yes, he 'ahav ·affectionately loved· cursing, and it came to him. He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.
PSA 109:18 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment. It came into his inward parts like water, like oil into his bones.
PSA 109:19 Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself, for the belt that is always around him.
PSA 109:20 This is the reward of my adversaries from Adonai, of those who speak evil against my soul.
PSA 109:21 But deal with me, Adonai the 'Adonay [Yahweh the Lord], for your name’s sake, because your chesed ·loving-kindness· is good, deliver me;
PSA 109:22 for I am poor and needy. My heart is wounded within me.
PSA 109:23 I fade away like an evening shadow. I am shaken off like a locust.
PSA 109:24 My knees are weak through fasting. My body is thin and lacks fat.
PSA 109:25 I have also become a reproach to them. When they see me, they shake their head.
PSA 109:26 Help me, Adonai, my God. Save me according to your chesed ·loving-kindness·;
PSA 109:27 that they may know that this is your hand; that you, Adonai, have done it.
PSA 109:28 They may curse, but you bless. When they arise, they will be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.
PSA 109:29 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor. Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
PSA 109:30 I will give great thanks to Adonai with my mouth. Yes, I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to him among the multitude.
PSA 109:31 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those who judge his soul.
PSA 110:1 Yahweh says to 'adoni ·my Lord·, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
PSA 110:2 Adonai will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. Rule among your enemies.
PSA 110:3 Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array. Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.
PSA 110:4 Adonai has sworn, and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever in the order of Malki-Tzedek [My king Righteousness].”
PSA 110:5 'Adonay [Lord] is at your right hand. He will crush kings in the day of his wrath.
PSA 110:6 He will judge among the nations. He will heap up dead bodies. He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
PSA 110:7 He will drink of the brook on the way; therefore he will lift up his head.
PSA 111:1 א Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai with my whole heart, בּ in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
PSA 111:2 גּ Adonai’s works are great, דּ pondered by all those who delight in them.
PSA 111:3 ה His work is honor and majesty. ו His righteousness endures forever.

PSA 111:7 מ The works of his hands are truth and mishpat ·justice·. נ All his precepts are sure.
PSA 111:8 ס They are established forever and ever. ע They are done in truth and uprightness.
PSA 111:9 פּ He has sent redemption to his people. צ He has enjoined his covenant forever. ק His name is holy and awesome!
PSA 111:10 ר The fear of Adonai is the beginning of wisdom. שׂ All those who do his work have a good understanding. תּ His tehilah ·praise song· endures forever!
PSA 112:1 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! א Blessed is the man who fears Adonai, בּ who delights greatly in his mitzvot ·instructions·.
PSA 112:2 גּ His offspring will be mighty in the land. דּ The generation of the upright will be blessed.
PSA 112:3 ה Wealth and riches are in his house. ו His righteousness endures forever.
PSA 112:4 ז Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, ח gracious, merciful, and righteous.
PSA 112:5 ט It is well with the man who is merciful and lends. י He will maintain his cause in judgment.
PSA 112:6 כּ For he will never be shaken. ל The upright will be remembered forever.
PSA 112:7 מ He will not be afraid of evil news. נ His heart is steadfast, trusting in Adonai.
PSA 112:8 ס His heart is established. ע He will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries.
PSA 112:9 פּ He has dispersed, he has given to the poor. צ His righteousness endures forever. ק His horn will be exalted with kavod ·weighty glory·.
PSA 112:10 ר The wicked will see it, and be grieved. שׁ He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. תּ The desire of the wicked will perish.
PSA 113:1 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise, you servants of Adonai, praise Adonai’s name.
PSA 113:2 Blessed be Adonai’s name, from this time forward and forever more.
PSA 113:3 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, Adonai’s name is to be praised.
PSA 113:4 Adonai is high above all nations, his kavod ·weighty glory· above the heavens.
PSA 113:5 Who is like Adonai, our God, who has his seat on high,
PSA 113:6 Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
PSA 113:7 He raises up the poor out of the dust. Lifts up the needy from the ash heap;
PSA 113:8 that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
PSA 113:9 He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother of children. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 114:1 When Israel [God prevails] went out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], the house of Jacob [Supplanter] from a people of foreign language;
PSA 114:2 Judah [Praised] became his sanctuary, Israel [God prevails] his dominion.
PSA 114:3 The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan [Descender] was driven back.
PSA 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
PSA 114:5 What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan [Descender], that you turned back?
PSA 114:6 You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills, like lambs?
PSA 114:7 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of 'Adon [Lord], at the presence of the God of Jacob [Supplanter],
PSA 114:8 who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.
PSA 115:1 Not to us, Adonai, not to us, but to your name give kavod ·weighty glory·, for your chesed ·loving-kindness·, and for your truth’s sake.
PSA 115:2 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God, now?”
PSA 115:3 But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases.
PSA 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
PSA 115:5 They have mouths, but they don’t speak. They have eyes, but they don’t see.
PSA 115:6 They have ears, but they don’t sh'ma ·hear obey·. They have noses, but they don’t smell.
PSA 115:7 They have hands, but they don’t feel. They have feet, but they don’t walk, neither do they speak through their throat.
PSA 115:8 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them.
PSA 115:9 Israel [God prevails], trust in Adonai! He is their help and their shield.
PSA 115:10 House of Aaron [Light-bringer], trust in Adonai! He is their help and their shield.
PSA 115:11 You who fear Adonai, trust in Adonai! He is their help and their shield.
PSA 115:12 Adonai remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel [God prevails]. He will bless the house of Aaron [Light-bringer].
PSA 115:13 He will bless those who fear Adonai, both small and great.
PSA 115:14 May Adonai increase you more and more, you and your children.
PSA 115:15 Blessed are you by Adonai, who made heaven and earth.
PSA 115:16 The heavens are the heavens of Adonai; but the earth has he given to the children of men.
PSA 115:17 The dead don’t Halleluyah ·praise Yah·, neither any who go down into silence;
PSA 115:18 But we will bless Yah, from this time forward and forever more. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 116:1 I 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai, because he sh'ma ·hears obeys· my voice, and my cries for mercy.
PSA 116:2 Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
PSA 116:3 The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol ·Place of the dead· got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow.
PSA 116:4 Then I called on Adonai’s name: “Adonai, I beg you, deliver my soul.”
PSA 116:5 Adonai is gracious and righteous. Yes, our God is racham ·merciful love·.
PSA 116:6 Adonai preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me.
PSA 116:7 Teshuvah ·Completely return· to your rest, my soul, for Adonai has dealt bountifully with you.
PSA 116:8 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
PSA 116:9 I will walk before Adonai in the land of the living.
PSA 116:10 I trusted, therefore I said, “I was greatly afflicted.”
PSA 116:11 I said in my haste, “All men are liars.”
PSA 116:12 What will I give to Adonai for all his benefits toward me?
PSA 116:13 I will take the cup of yishu'ah ·salvation·, and call on Adonai’s name.
PSA 116:14 I will pay my vows to Adonai, yes, in the presence of all his people.
PSA 116:15 Precious in Adonai’s sight is the death of his saints.
PSA 116:16 Adonai, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your servant. You have freed me from my chains.
PSA 116:17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on Adonai’s name.
PSA 116:18 I will pay my vows to Adonai, yes, in the presence of all his people,
PSA 116:19 in the courts of Adonai’s house, in the middle of you, Jerusalem [City of peace]. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 117:1 Praise Adonai, all you nations! Extol him, all you peoples!
PSA 117:2 For his chesed chesed ·loving-kindness loving-kindness· is great toward us. Adonai’s faithfulness endures forever. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 118:1 Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai, for he is good, for his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 118:2 Let Israel [God prevails] now say that his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 118:3 Let the house of Aaron [Light-bringer] now say that his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 118:4 Now let those who fear Adonai say that his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 118:5 Out of my distress, I called on Yah. Yah answered me with freedom.
PSA 118:6 With Adonai on my side. I will not be afraid. What can a human being do to me?
PSA 118:7 Adonai is on my side among those who help me. Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me.
PSA 118:8 It is better to take refuge in Adonai, than to put confidence in man.
PSA 118:9 It is better to take refuge in Adonai, than to put confidence in princes.
PSA 118:10 All the nations surrounded me, but in Adonai’s name, I cut them off.
PSA 118:11 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me. In Adonai’s name I indeed cut them off.
PSA 118:12 They surrounded me like bees. They are quenched like the burning thorns. In Adonai’s name I cut them off.
PSA 118:13 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Adonai helped me.
PSA 118:14 Yah is my strength and song. He has become my yishu'ah ·salvation·.
PSA 118:15 The voice of rejoicing and yishu'ah ·salvation· is in the tents of the upright. “The right hand of Adonai does valiantly.
PSA 118:16 The right hand of Adonai is exalted! The right hand of Adonai does valiantly!”
PSA 118:17 I will not die, but live, and declare Yah’s works.
PSA 118:18 Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me over to death.
PSA 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness. I will enter into them. I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Yah.
PSA 118:20 This is the gate of Adonai; the upright will enter into it.
PSA 118:21 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, for you have answered me, and have become my yishu'ah ·salvation·.
PSA 118:22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the corner-stone.
PSA 118:23 This is Adonai ’s doing. It is marvelous in our eyes.
PSA 118:24 This is the day that Adonai has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it!
PSA 118:25 Save us now, we beg you, Adonai ! Adonai , we beg you, send prosperity now.
PSA 118:26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Adonai ! We have blessed you out of Adonai ’s house.
PSA 118:27 Adonai is God, and he has given us light. Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
PSA 118:28 You are my God, and I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you. You are my God, I will exalt you.

PSA 128:6 Yes, may you see your children’s children. Peace be upon Israel [God prevails].
PSA 129:1 Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel [God prevails] now say,
PSA 129:2 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.
PSA 129:3 The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long.
PSA 129:4 Adonai is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
PSA 129:5 Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
PSA 129:6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up;
PSA 129:7 with which the reaper does not fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
PSA 129:8 Neither do those who go by say, “The blessing of Adonai be on you. We bless you in Adonai’s name.”
PSA 130:1 Out of the depths I have cried to you, Adonai.
PSA 130:2 Lord, sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.

PSA 130:7 Israel [God prevails], hope in Adonai, for with Adonai there is chesed ·loving-kindness·. With him is abundant redemption.
PSA 130:8 He will redeem Israel [God prevails] from all their depravities (moral evils).
PSA 131:1 Adonai, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me.
PSA 131:2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
PSA 131:3 Israel [God prevails], hope in Adonai, from this time forward and forever more.
PSA 132:1 Adonai, remember David [Beloved] and all his affliction,
PSA 132:2 how he swore to Adonai, and vowed to the 'Avir Ya'akov [Mighty One of Supplanter]:
PSA 132:3 “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, nor go up into my bed;
PSA 132:4 I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;
PSA 132:5 until I find out a place for Adonai, a dwelling for the 'Avir Ya'akov [Mighty One of Supplanter].”
PSA 132:6 Behold, we sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar:
PSA 132:7 “We will go into his dwelling place. We will hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship at his footstool.
PSA 132:8 Arise, Adonai, into your resting place; you, and the ark of your strength.
PSA 132:9 Let your priest be clothed with righteousness. Let your saints shout for joy!”
PSA 132:10 For your servant David [Beloved]’s sake, don’t turn away the face of your anointed one.
PSA 132:11 Adonai has sworn to David [Beloved] in truth. He will not turn from it: “I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
PSA 132:12 If your children will keep my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, my testimony that I will teach them, their children also will sit on your throne forever more.”
PSA 132:13 For Adonai has chosen Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. He has desired it for his habitation.
PSA 132:14 “This is my resting place forever. Here I will live, for I have desired it.
PSA 132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.
PSA 132:16 Her priests I will also clothe with yesha' ·salvation·. Her saints will shout aloud for joy.
PSA 132:17 There I will make the horn of David [Beloved] to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
PSA 132:18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself, his crown will be resplendent.”
PSA 133:1 See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity!
PSA 133:2 It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron [Light-bringer]’s beard; that came down on the edge of his robes;
PSA 133:3 like the dew of Hermon [Devoted to destruction], that comes down on the hills of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]: for there Adonai enjoined blessing, even life forever more.
PSA 134:1 Look! Praise Adonai, all you servants of Adonai, who stand by night in Adonai’s house!
PSA 134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary. Praise Adonai!
PSA 134:3 May Adonai bless you from Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]; even he who made heaven and earth.
PSA 135:1 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise Adonai’s name! Praise him, you servants of Adonai,
PSA 135:2 you who stand in Adonai’s house, in the courts of our God’s house.
PSA 135:3 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·, for Adonai is good. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to his name, for that is pleasant.
PSA 135:4 For Yah has chosen Jacob [Supplanter] for himself; Israel [God prevails] for his own segulah ·special treasure·.
PSA 135:5 For I know that Adonai is great, that our Lord is above all deities.
PSA 135:6 Whatever Adonai pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
PSA 135:7 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings the wind out of his treasuries;
PSA 135:8 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt [Abode of slavery], both of man and animal;
PSA 135:9 Who sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt [Abode of slavery], on Pharaoh, and on all his servants;
PSA 135:10 who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings,
PSA 135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers], Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan [Humbled],
PSA 135:12 and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel [God prevails], his people.
PSA 135:13 Your name, Adonai, endures forever; your renown, Adonai, throughout all generations.
PSA 135:14 For Adonai will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants.
PSA 135:15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
PSA 135:16 They have mouths, but they can’t speak. They have eyes, but they can’t see.
PSA 135:17 They have ears, but they can’t hear; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
PSA 135:18 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them.
PSA 135:19 House of Israel [God prevails], praise Adonai! House of Aaron [Light-bringer], praise Adonai!
PSA 135:20 House of Levi [United with], praise Adonai! You who fear Adonai, praise Adonai!
PSA 135:21 Blessed be Adonai from Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], Who dwells at Jerusalem [City of peace]. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 136:1 Hodu la-Yahweh ki'-tov ·Give thanks to Adonai for he is good·, and yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise·; ki' li-olam chas'do ·for his loving-kindness endures forever·.
PSA 136:2 Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to the Elohei of the elohim ·God of the deities·; for his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 136:3 Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to the 'Adonei of the adoneim ·the Lord of the lords·; for his faithful love endures forever:
PSA 136:4 To him who alone does great wonders; for his steadfast love endures forever:
PSA 136:5 To him who by understanding made the heavens; for his loving kindness is everlasting:
PSA 136:6 To him who spread out the earth above the waters; for his loyal love endures forever:
PSA 136:7 To him who made the great lights; for his mercies are to eternity:
PSA 136:8 The sun to rule by day; for his gracious love is everlasting;
PSA 136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night; for his mercy continues forever:
PSA 136:10 To him who struck down the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery] firstborn; for his grace endures forever;
PSA 136:11 And brought out Israel [God prevails] from among them; for his loyal devotion endures forever;
PSA 136:12 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; for his covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· loyalty endures forever:
PSA 136:13 To him who divided the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea] apart; ki' li-olam chas'do ·for his loving-kindness endures forever·.
PSA 136:14 And made Israel [God prevails] to pass through the middle of it; for his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Sea of Suf [Reed Sea]; for his faithful love endures forever:
PSA 136:16 To him who led his people through the wilderness; for his steadfast love endures forever:
PSA 136:17 To him who struck great kings; for his loving kindness is everlasting:
PSA 136:18 And killed mighty kings; for his loyal love endures forever:
PSA 136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites [Descendants of Talkers]; for his mercies are to eternity:
PSA 136:20 Og king of Bashan; for his gracious love is everlasting;
PSA 136:21 And gave their land as an inheritance; for his mercy continues forever:
PSA 136:22 Even a heritage to Israel [God prevails] his servant; for his grace endures forever;
PSA 136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate; for his loyal devotion endures forever;
PSA 136:24 And has delivered us from our adversaries; for his loving kindness endures forever:
PSA 136:25 Who gives food to every creature; for his chesed ·loving-kindness· endures forever.
PSA 136:26 Oh yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to the God of heaven; ki' li-olam chas'do ·for his loving-kindness endures forever·.
PSA 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon [Confusion], there we sat down. Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
PSA 137:2 On the willows in that land, we hung up our harps.
PSA 137:3 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: “Sing us one of the songs of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]!”
PSA 137:4 How can we sing Adonai’s song in a foreign land?
PSA 137:5 If I forget you, Jerusalem [City of peace], let my right hand forget its skill.
PSA 137:6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you; if I don’t prefer Jerusalem [City of peace] above my chief joy.
PSA 137:7 Remember, Adonai, against the children of Edom [Red], the day of Jerusalem [City of peace]; who said, “Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!”
PSA 137:8 Daughter of Babylon [Confusion], doomed to destruction, he will be happy who rewards you, as you have served us.
PSA 137:9 Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
PSA 138:1 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to with my whole heart. Before the deities, I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you.
PSA 138:2 I will bow down toward your holy temple, and yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your Name for your chesed ·loving-kindness· and for your truth; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
PSA 138:3 In the day that I called, you answered me. You encouraged me with strength in my soul.
PSA 138:4 All the kings of the earth will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai, for they have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the words of your mouth.
PSA 138:5 Yes, they will sing of the ways of Adonai; for great is the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing·.
PSA 138:6 For though Adonai is high, yet he looks after the lowly; but the proud, he knows from afar.
PSA 138:7 Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me. You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies. Your right hand will save me.
PSA 138:8 Adonai will fulfill that which concerns me; your chesed ·loving-kindness·, Adonai, endures forever. Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.
PSA 139:1 Adonai, you have searched me, and you know me.
PSA 139:2 You know my sitting down and my rising up. You perceive my thoughts from afar.
PSA 139:3 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.
PSA 139:4 For there is not a word on my tongue, but, behold, Adonai, you know it altogether.
PSA 139:5 You hem me in behind and before. You laid your hand on me.
PSA 139:6 This knowledge is beyond me. It’s lofty. I can’t attain it.
PSA 139:7 Where could I go from your Ruach ·Spirit, Breath·? Or where could I flee from your presence?
PSA 139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in Sheol ·Place of the dead·, behold, you are there!
PSA 139:9 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;
PSA 139:10 Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me.
PSA 139:11 If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light around me will be night;”
PSA 139:12 even the darkness does not hide from you, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to you.
PSA 139:13 For you formed my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother’s womb.
PSA 139:14 I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows that very well.
PSA 139:15 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth.
PSA 139:16 Your eyes saw my body. In your book they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were none of them.
PSA 139:17 How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is their sum!
PSA 139:18 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with you.
PSA 139:19 If only you, God, would kill the wicked. Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!
PSA 139:20 For they speak against you wickedly. Your enemies take your name in vain.
PSA 139:21 Adonai, don’t I hate those who hate you? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?
PSA 139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies.
PSA 139:23 Search me, God, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts.
PSA 139:24 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.
PSA 140:1 Deliver me, Adonai, from the evil man. Preserve me from the violent man;
PSA 140:2 those who devise mischief in their hearts. They continually gather themselves together for war.
PSA 140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. Viper’s poison is under their lips. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 140:4 Adonai, keep me from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.
PSA 140:5 The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords of a net by the path. They have set traps for me. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 140:6 I said to Adonai, “You are my God.” Listen to the cry of my petitions, Adonai.
PSA 140:7 Adonai the 'Adonay [Yahweh the Lord], the strength of my yishu'ah ·salvation·, you have covered my head in the day of battle.
PSA 140:8 Adonai, don’t grant the desires of the wicked. Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 140:9 As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
PSA 140:10 Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never rise.
PSA 140:11 An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
PSA 140:12 I know that Adonai will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and mishpat ·justice· for the needy.
PSA 140:13 Surely the upright will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your name. The upright will dwell in your presence.
PSA 141:1 Adonai, I have called on you. Come to me quickly! Listen to my voice when I call to you.
PSA 141:2 Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
PSA 141:3 Set a watch, Adonai, before my mouth. Keep the door of my lips.
PSA 141:4 Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of ethical wickedness with men who work vain striving of iniquity. Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.
PSA 141:5 Let the upright strike me, it is kindness; let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; don’t let my head refuse it; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
PSA 141:6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. They will sh'ma ·hear obey· my words, for they are well spoken.
PSA 141:7 “As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol ·Place of the dead·.”
PSA 141:8 For my eyes are on you, Adonai, the 'Adonay [Yahweh the Lord]. In you, I take refuge. Don’t leave my soul destitute.
PSA 141:9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, from the traps of the workers of vain striving of iniquity.
PSA 141:10 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass by.
PSA 142:1 I cry with my voice to Adonai. With my voice, I ask Adonai for mercy.
PSA 142:2 I pour out my complaint before him. I tell him my troubles.
PSA 142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my route. On the path in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
PSA 142:4 Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my soul.
PSA 142:5 I cried to you, Adonai. I said, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”
PSA 142:6 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need. Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
PSA 142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your name. The upright will surround me, for you will be good to me.
PSA 143:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my prayer, Adonai. Listen to my petitions. In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
PSA 143:2 Don’t enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight no man living is upright.
PSA 143:3 For the enemy pursues my soul. He has struck my life down to the ground. He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.
PSA 143:4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.
PSA 143:5 I remember the days of old. I meditate on all your doings. I contemplate the work of your hands.
PSA 143:6 I spread out my hands to you. My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
PSA 143:7 Hurry to answer me, Adonai. My spirit fails. Don’t hide your face from me, so that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol).
PSA 143:8 Cause me to sh'ma ·hear obey· your chesed ·loving-kindness· in the morning, for I trust in you. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to you.
PSA 143:9 Deliver me, Adonai, from my enemies. I flee to you to hide me.
PSA 143:10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.
PSA 143:11 Revive me, Adonai, for your name’s sake. In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.
PSA 143:12 In your chesed ·loving-kindness·, cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, For I am your servant.
PSA 144:1 Blessed be Adonai, my rock, who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to battle:
PSA 144:2 my chesed ·loving-kindness·, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I take refuge; who subdues my people under me.
PSA 144:3 Adonai, what is man, that you care for him? Or the son of man, that you think of him?
PSA 144:4 Man is like a breath. His days are like a shadow that passes away.
PSA 144:5 Part your heavens, Adonai, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
PSA 144:6 Throw out lightning, and scatter them. Send out your arrows, and rout them.
PSA 144:7 Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
PSA 144:8 whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA 144:9 I will sing a new song to you, God. On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you.
PSA 144:10 You are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David [Beloved], his servant, from the deadly sword.
PSA 144:11 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA 144:12 Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
PSA 144:13 Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. Our sheep produce thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
PSA 144:14 Our oxen will pull heavy loads. There is no breaking in, and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.
PSA 144:15 Happy are the people who are in such a situation. Happy are the people whose God is Adonai.
PSA 145:1 א I will exalt you, my God, the King. I will praise your name forever and ever.
PSA 145:2 בּ Every day I will praise you. I will extol your name forever and ever.
PSA 145:3 גּ Great is Adonai, and greatly to be praised! His greatness is unsearchable.
PSA 145:4 דּ One generation will commend your works to another, and will declare your mighty acts.
PSA 145:5 ה Of the glorious majesty of your kavod ·weighty glory·, of your wondrous works, I will meditate.
PSA 145:6 ו Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts. I will declare your greatness.
PSA 145:7 ז They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will sing of your righteousness.
PSA 145:8 ח Adonai is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of great chesed ·loving-kindness·.
PSA 145:9 ט Adonai is good to all. His tender rachamim ·merciful loves· is over all his works.
PSA 145:10 י All your works will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, Adonai. Your saints will extol you.
PSA 145:11 כּ They will speak of the kavod ·weighty glory· of your kingdom, and talk about your power;
PSA 145:12 ל to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the kavod ·weighty glory· of the majesty of his kingdom.
PSA 145:13 מ Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. Your dominion endures throughout all generations. Adonai is faithful in all his words, and loving in all his deeds.
PSA 145:14 ס Adonai upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who are bowed down.
PSA 145:15 ע The eyes of all wait for you. You give them their food in due season.
PSA 145:16 פּ You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
PSA 145:17 צ Adonai is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.
PSA 145:18 ק Adonai is near to all those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
PSA 145:19 ר He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him. He also will sh'ma ·hear obey· their cry, and will save them.
PSA 145:20 שׁ Adonai preserves all those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· him, but all the wicked he will destroy.
PSA 145:21 תּ My mouth will speak the tehilah ·praise song· of Adonai. Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.
PSA 146:1 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise Adonai, my soul.
PSA 146:2 While I live, I will praise Adonai. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to my God as long as I exist.
PSA 146:3 Don’t put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom there is no help.
PSA 146:4 His spirit departs, and he teshuvah ·completely returns· to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish.
PSA 146:5 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob [Supplanter] for his help, whose hope is in Adonai, his God:
PSA 146:6 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;
PSA 146:7 who executes mishpat ·justice· for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Adonai frees the prisoners.
PSA 146:8 Adonai opens the eyes of the blind. Adonai raises up those who are bowed down. Adonai 'ahav ·affectionately loves· the upright.
PSA 146:9 Adonai preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
PSA 146:10 Adonai will reign forever; your God, O Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], to all generations. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 147:1 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·, for it is good to sing tehilahot ·praise songs· to our God; for it is pleasant and fitting to make zahmar ·musical praise· unto him.
PSA 147:2 Adonai builds up Jerusalem [City of peace]. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel [God prevails].
PSA 147:3 He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.
PSA 147:4 He counts the number of the stars. He calls them all by their names.
PSA 147:5 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power. His understanding is infinite.
PSA 147:6 Adonai upholds the humble. He brings the wicked down to the ground.
PSA 147:7 Sing to Adonai with thanksgiving. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· on the harp to our God,
PSA 147:8 who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass grow on the mountains.
PSA 147:9 He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens when they call.
PSA 147:10 He does not delight in the strength of the horse. He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
PSA 147:11 Adonai takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his chesed ·loving-kindness·.
PSA 147:12 Praise Adonai, Jerusalem [City of peace]! Praise your God, Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]!
PSA 147:13 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates. He has blessed your children within you.
PSA 147:14 He makes peace in your borders. He fills you with the finest of the wheat.
PSA 147:15 He sends his word out over the earth. His word runs very swiftly.
PSA 147:16 He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes.
PSA 147:17 He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can stand before his cold?
PSA 147:18 He sends out his word, and melts them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
PSA 147:19 He shows his word to Jacob [Supplanter]; his statutes and his judgments to Israel [God prevails].
PSA 147:20 He has not done this for just any nation. They don’t know his judgments. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 148:1 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise Adonai from the heavens! Praise him in the heights!
PSA 148:2 Praise him, all his angels! Praise him, all his army!
PSA 148:3 Praise him, sun and moon! Praise him, all you shining stars!
PSA 148:4 Praise him, you heavens of heavens, You waters that are above the heavens.
PSA 148:5 Let them praise Adonai’s name, For he enjoined, and they were created.
PSA 148:6 He has also established them forever and ever. He has made a statute which will not pass away.
PSA 148:7 Praise Adonai from the earth, you great sea creatures, and all depths!
PSA 148:8 Lightning and hail, snow and clouds; stormy wind, fulfilling his word;
PSA 148:9 mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all cedars;
PSA 148:10 wild animals and all livestock; small creatures and flying birds;
PSA 148:11 kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth;
PSA 148:12 both young men and maidens; old men and children:
PSA 148:13 let them praise Adonai’s name, for his name alone is exalted. His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
PSA 148:14 He has lifted up the horn of his people, the tehilah ·praise song· of all his saints; even of the children of Israel [God prevails], a people near to him. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 149:1 Praise Adonai! Sing to Adonai a new song, his tehilah ·praise song· in the assembly of the saints.
PSA 149:2 Let Israel [God prevails] rejoice in him who made them. Let the children of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] be joyful in their King.
PSA 149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance! Let them sing zahmar ·musical praise· to him with tambourine and harp!
PSA 149:4 For Adonai takes pleasure in his people. He crowns the humble with yishu'ah ·salvation·.
PSA 149:5 Let the saints rejoice in kavod ·weighty glory·. Let them sing for joy on their beds.
PSA 149:6 May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand;
PSA 149:7 To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples;
PSA 149:8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
PSA 149:9 to execute on them the written judgment. All his saints have this honor. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PSA 150:1 Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise God in his sanctuary! Praise him in his heavens for his acts of power!
PSA 150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts! Praise him according to his excellent greatness!

PSA 150:5 Praise him with loud cymbals! Praise him with resounding cymbals!
PSA 150:6 Let everything that has breath Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
PRO 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense], the son of David [Beloved], king of Israel [God prevails]:
PRO 1:2 to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
PRO 1:3 to receive instruction in wisdom, in righteousness, mishpat ·justice·, and equity;
PRO 1:4 to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man:
PRO 1:5 that the wise man may sh'ma ·hear obey·, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
PRO 1:6 to understand a proverb, and parables, the words and riddles of the wise.
PRO 1:7 The fear of Adonai is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
PRO 1:8 My son, sh'ma ·hear obey· your father’s instruction, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching:
PRO 1:9 for they will be a garland to chen ·grace· your head, and chains around your neck.
PRO 1:10 My son, if people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· entice you, don’t consent.
PRO 1:11 If they say, “Come with us, Let’s lay in wait for blood; let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
PRO 1:12 let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol ·Place of the dead·, and whole, like those who go down into the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol).
PRO 1:13 We’ll find all valuable wealth. We’ll fill our houses with plunder.
PRO 1:14 You shall cast your lot among us. We’ll all have one purse.”
PRO 1:15 My son, don’t walk on the path with them. Keep your foot from their path,
PRO 1:16 for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.
PRO 1:17 For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:
PRO 1:18 but these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.
PRO 1:19 So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners.
PRO 1:20 Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares.
PRO 1:21 She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:
PRO 1:22 “How long, you simple ones, will you 'ahav ·affectionately love· thoughtless living? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge?
PRO 1:23 Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you.
PRO 1:24 Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
PRO 1:25 but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;
PRO 1:26 I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you;
PRO 1:27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come on you.
PRO 1:28 Then will they call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;
PRO 1:29 because they hated knowledge, and didn’t choose the fear of Adonai.
PRO 1:30 They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.
PRO 1:31 Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes.
PRO 1:32 For the backsliding apostasy and willful rejection of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
PRO 1:33 But whoever sh'ma ·hears obeys· me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”
PRO 2:1 My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my mitzvot ·instructions· within you;
PRO 2:2 So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;
PRO 2:3 Yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your voice for understanding;
PRO 2:4 If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures:
PRO 2:5 then you will understand the fear of Adonai, and find the knowledge of God.
PRO 2:6 For Adonai gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
PRO 2:7 He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;
PRO 2:8 that he may guard the paths of mishpat ·justice·, and preserve the way of his saints.
PRO 2:9 Then you will understand righteousness and mishpat ·justice·, equity and every good path.
PRO 2:10 For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
PRO 2:11 Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you,
PRO 2:12 to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things;
PRO 2:13 who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
PRO 2:14 who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil;
PRO 2:15 who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:
PRO 2:16 To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;
PRO 2:17 who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of her God:
PRO 2:18 for her house leads down to death, her paths to the departed spirits.
PRO 2:19 None who go to her teshuvah ·completely return· again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:
PRO 2:20 that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the upright.
PRO 2:21 For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it.
PRO 2:22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
PRO 3:1 My son, don’t forget my teaching; but keep my mitzvot ·instructions· in your heart:
PRO 3:2 for length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to you.
PRO 3:3 Don’t let chesed ·loving-kindness· and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO 3:4 So you will find chen ·grace·, and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
PRO 3:5 Trust in Adonai with all your heart, and don’t lean on your own understanding.
PRO 3:6 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.
PRO 3:7 Don’t be wise in your own eyes. Fear Adonai, and depart from evil.
PRO 3:8 It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.
PRO 3:9 Honor Adonai with your substance, with the first fruits of all your increase:
PRO 3:10 so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.
PRO 3:11 My son, don’t despise Adonai’s discipline, neither be despondent when he corrects you:
PRO 3:12 for whom Adonai 'ahav ·affectionately loves·, he reproves; even as a father reproves his son in whom he delights.
PRO 3:13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.
PRO 3:14 For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her teshuvah ·complete return· is better than fine gold.
PRO 3:15 She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
PRO 3:16 Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and kavod ·weighty glory·.
PRO 3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace.
PRO 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her.
PRO 3:19 By wisdom Adonai founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens.
PRO 3:20 By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.
PRO 3:21 My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
PRO 3:22 so they will be life to your soul, and chen ·grace· for your neck.
PRO 3:23 Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won’t stumble.
PRO 3:24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
PRO 3:25 Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:
PRO 3:26 for Adonai will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken.
PRO 3:27 Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
PRO 3:28 Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; tomorrow I will give it to you,” when you have it by you.
PRO 3:29 Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells securely by you.
PRO 3:30 Don’t strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
PRO 3:31 Don’t envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways.
PRO 3:32 For the perverse is an abomination to Adonai, but his friendship is with the upright.
PRO 3:33 Adonai’s curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the upright.
PRO 3:34 Surely he opposes the mockers, but he gives chen ·grace· to the humble.
PRO 3:35 The wise will inherit kavod ·weighty glory·, but shame will be the promotion of fools.
PRO 4:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, sons, to a father’s instruction. Pay attention and know understanding;
PRO 4:2 for I give you sound learning. Don’t forsake my Torah ·Teaching·.
PRO 4:3 For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.
PRO 4:4 He taught me, and said to me: “Let your heart retain my words. Keep my mitzvot ·instructions·, and live.
PRO 4:5 Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don’t forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth.
PRO 4:6 Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. 'Ahav ·Affectionately love· her, and she will keep you.
PRO 4:7 Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.
PRO 4:8 Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.
PRO 4:9 She will give to your head a garland of chen ·grace·. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”
PRO 4:10 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many.
PRO 4:11 I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths.
PRO 4:12 When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble.
PRO 4:13 Take firm hold of instruction. Don’t let her go. Keep her, for she is your life.
PRO 4:14 Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. Don’t walk in the way of evil men.
PRO 4:15 Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.
PRO 4:16 For they don’t sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.
PRO 4:17 For they eat the bread of ethical wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
PRO 4:18 But the path of the upright is like the dawning light, that shines more and more until the perfect day.
PRO 4:19 The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don’t know what they stumble over.
PRO 4:20 My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings.
PRO 4:21 Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the center of your heart.
PRO 4:22 For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole body.
PRO 4:23 Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the wellspring of life.
PRO 4:24 Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you.
PRO 4:25 Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.
PRO 4:26 Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established.
PRO 4:27 Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil.
PRO 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding:
PRO 5:2 that you may maintain discretion, that your lips may preserve knowledge.
PRO 5:3 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil,
PRO 5:4 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword.
PRO 5:5 Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
PRO 5:6 She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she does not know it.
PRO 5:7 Now therefore, my sons, sh'ma ·hear obey· me. Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.
PRO 5:8 Remove your way far from her. Don’t come near the door of her house,
PRO 5:9 lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;
PRO 5:10 lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich another man’s house.
PRO 5:11 You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your body are consumed,
PRO 5:12 and say, “How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
PRO 5:13 neither have I sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!
PRO 5:14 I have come to the brink of utter ruin, among the gathered assembly.”
PRO 5:15 Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of your own well.
PRO 5:16 Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares?
PRO 5:17 Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.
PRO 5:18 Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
PRO 5:19 An ahab ·affectionately loving· doe and a chen ·graceful· deer— let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be intoxicated always with her love.
PRO 5:20 For why should you, my son, be led astray, intoxicated sin ·error· with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another?
PRO 5:21 For the ways of man are before Adonai’s eyes. He examines all his paths.
PRO 5:22 The depravities (moral evils) of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his habitual sins ·missing the marks· hold him firmly.
PRO 5:23 He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will be led astray, intoxicated, unintentional sin ·error·.
PRO 6:1 My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;
PRO 6:2 You are trapped by the words of your mouth. You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.
PRO 6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor.
PRO 6:4 Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
PRO 6:5 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
PRO 6:6 Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise;
PRO 6:7 which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
PRO 6:8 provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.
PRO 6:9 How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?
PRO 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO 6:11 so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity as an armed man.
PRO 6:12 A worthless person, a man of vain striving of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth;
PRO 6:13 who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers;
PRO 6:14 in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who always sows discord.
PRO 6:15 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
PRO 6:16 There are six things which Adonai hates; yes, seven which are an abomination to him:
PRO 6:17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood;
PRO 6:18 a heart that devises vain striving of iniquity schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,
PRO 6:19 a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.
PRO 6:20 My son, keep your father’s mitzvah ·instruction·, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.
PRO 6:21 Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.
PRO 6:22 When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you.
PRO 6:23 For the mitzvah ·instruction· is a lamp candle, and the Torah ·Teaching· is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
PRO 6:24 to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.
PRO 6:25 Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.
PRO 6:26 For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
PRO 6:27 Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?
PRO 6:28 Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
PRO 6:29 So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.
PRO 6:30 Men don’t despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:
PRO 6:31 but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house.
PRO 6:32 He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.
PRO 6:33 He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away.
PRO 6:34 For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO 6:35 He won’t regard any ransom, neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
PRO 7:1 My son, keep my words. Lay up my mitzvot ·instructions· within you.
PRO 7:2 Obey my mitzvot ·instructions· and live! Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.
PRO 7:3 Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO 7:4 Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.” Call understanding your relative,
PRO 7:5 that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words.
PRO 7:6 For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice.
PRO 7:7 I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,
PRO 7:8 passing through the street near her corner, he went the way to her house,
PRO 7:9 in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness.
PRO 7:10 Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, and with crafty intent.
PRO 7:11 She is loud and defiant. Her feet don’t stay in her house.
PRO 7:12 Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking at every corner.
PRO 7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him:
PRO 7:14 “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. Today I have paid my vows.
PRO 7:15 Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face, and I have found you.
PRO 7:16 I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
PRO 7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO 7:18 Come, let’s take our fill of dod ·loving· until the morning. Let’s solace ourselves with loving.
PRO 7:19 For my husband is not at home. He has gone on a long journey.
PRO 7:20 He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.”
PRO 7:21 With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.
PRO 7:22 He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, as a fool stepping into a noose.
PRO 7:23 Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries to the snare, and does not know that it will cost his life.
PRO 7:24 Now therefore, sons, sh'ma ·hear obey· me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth.
PRO 7:25 Don’t let your heart turn to her ways. Don’t go astray in her paths,
PRO 7:26 for she has thrown down many wounded. Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.
PRO 7:27 Her house is the way to Sheol ·Place of the dead·, going down to the rooms of death.
PRO 8:1 Does not wisdom cry out? Does not understanding raise her voice?
PRO 8:2 On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she stands.
PRO 8:3 Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors, she cries aloud:
PRO 8:4 “To you men, I call! I send my voice to the sons of mankind.
PRO 8:5 You simple, understand prudence. You fools, be of an understanding heart.
PRO 8:6 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, for I will speak excellent things. The opening of my lips is for right things.
PRO 8:7 For my mouth speaks truth. Ethical wickednessis an abomination to my lips.
PRO 8:8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
PRO 8:9 They are all plain to him who understands, right to those who find knowledge.
PRO 8:10 Receive my instruction rather than silver; knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO 8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies. All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.
PRO 8:12 “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling. Find out knowledge and discretion.
PRO 8:13 The fear of Adonai is to hate evil. I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
PRO 8:14 Counsel and sound knowledge are mine. I have understanding and power.
PRO 8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
PRO 8:16 By me princes rule; nobles, and all the upright rulers of the earth.
PRO 8:17 I 'ahav ·affectionately love· those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· me. Those who seek me diligently will find me.
PRO 8:18 With me are riches, kavod ·weighty glory·, enduring wealth, and prosperity.
PRO 8:19 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; my yield than choice silver.
PRO 8:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the middle of the paths of mishpat ·justice·;
PRO 8:21 That I may give wealth to those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· me. I fill their treasuries.
PRO 8:22 “ Adonai possessed me in the beginning of his work, before his deeds of old.
PRO 8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth existed.
PRO 8:24 When there were no depths, I was born, when there were no springs abounding with water.
PRO 8:25 Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was born;
PRO 8:26 while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
PRO 8:27 When he established the heavens, I was there; when he set a circle on the surface of the deep,
PRO 8:28 when he established the clouds above, when the springs of the deep became strong,
PRO 8:29 when he gave to the sea its boundary by his statute, that the waters should not violate the word of his mouth, when he marked out the foundations of the earth;
PRO 8:30 then I was the craftsman by his side. I was a delight day by day, always rejoicing before him,
PRO 8:31 Rejoicing in his whole world. My delight was with the sons of men.
PRO 8:32 “Now therefore, my sons, sh'ma ·hear obey· unto me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.
PRO 8:33 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· instruction, and be wise. Don’t refuse it.
PRO 8:34 Blessed is the man who sh'ma ·hears obeys· me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my door posts.
PRO 8:35 For whoever finds me, finds life, and will obtain favor from Adonai.
PRO 8:36 But he who sins ·errs (the standard goal)· against me wrongs his own soul. All those who hate me 'ahav ·affectionately love· death.”
PRO 9:1 Wisdom has built her house. She has carved out her seven pillars.
PRO 9:2 She has prepared her meat. She has mixed her wine. She has also set her table.
PRO 9:3 She has sent out her maidens. She cries from the highest places of the city:
PRO 9:4 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
PRO 9:5 “Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!
PRO 9:6 Leave your simple ways, and live. Walk in the way of understanding.”
PRO 9:7 He who corrects a mocker invites insult. He who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.
PRO 9:8 Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. Reprove a wise man, and he will 'ahav ·affectionately love· you.
PRO 9:9 Instruct a wise man, and he will be still wiser. Teach a upright man, and he will increase in learning.
PRO 9:10 The fear of Adonai is the beginning of wisdom. The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
PRO 9:11 For by me your days will be multiplied. The years of your life will be increased.
PRO 9:12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself. If you mock, you alone will bear it.
PRO 9:13 The foolish woman is loud, Undisciplined, and knows nothing.
PRO 9:14 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
PRO 9:15 To call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways,
PRO 9:16 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
PRO 9:17 “Stolen water is sweet. Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”
PRO 9:18 But he does not know that the departed spirits are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
PRO 10:1 The proverbs of Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense]. A wise son makes a glad father; but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
PRO 10:2 Treasures of ethical wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.
PRO 10:3 Adonai will not allow the soul of the upright to go hungry, but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
PRO 10:4 He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent brings wealth.
PRO 10:5 He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame.
PRO 10:6 Blessings are on the head of the upright, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
PRO 10:7 The memory of the upright is blessed, but the name of the wicked will rot.
PRO 10:8 The wise in heart receives mitzvot ·instructions·, but a chattering fool will fall.
PRO 10:9 He who walks blamelessly walks surely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.
PRO 10:10 One winking with the eye causes sorrow, but a chattering fool will fall.
PRO 10:11 The mouth of the upright is a spring of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
PRO 10:12 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all rebellious breaches of relationships.
PRO 10:13 Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment, but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.
PRO 10:14 Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish is near ruin.
PRO 10:15 The rich man’s wealth is his strong city. The destruction of the poor is their poverty.
PRO 10:16 The labor of the upright leads to life. The increase of the wicked leads to habitual sin ·missing the mark·.
PRO 10:17 He is in the way of life who heeds correction, but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray.
PRO 10:18 He who hides hatred has lying lips. He who utters a slander is a fool.
PRO 10:19 In the multitude of words there is no lack of rebellious breach of relationship, but he who restrains his lips does wisely.
PRO 10:20 The tongue of the upright is like choice silver. The heart of the wicked is of little worth.
PRO 10:21 The lips of the upright feed many, but the foolish die for lack of understanding.
PRO 10:22 Adonai’s blessing brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it.
PRO 10:23 It is a fool’s pleasure to do wickedness, but wisdom is a man of understanding’s pleasure.
PRO 10:24 What the wicked fear, will overtake them, but the desire of the upright will be granted.
PRO 10:25 When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more; but the upright stand firm forever.
PRO 10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.
PRO 10:27 The fear of Adonai prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
PRO 10:28 The prospect of the upright is joy, but the hope of the wicked will perish.
PRO 10:29 The way of Adonai is a stronghold to the upright, but it is a destruction to the workers of vain striving of iniquity.
PRO 10:30 The upright will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in the land.
PRO 10:31 The mouth of the upright produces wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be cut off.
PRO 10:32 The lips of the upright know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked is perverse.
PRO 11:1 A false balance is an abomination to Adonai, but accurate weights are his delight.
PRO 11:2 When pride comes, then comes shame, but with humility comes wisdom.
PRO 11:3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.
PRO 11:4 Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.

PRO 20:16 Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger; and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.
PRO 20:17 Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.
PRO 20:18 Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war!
PRO 20:19 He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets; therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips.
PRO 20:20 Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp candle shall be put out in blackness of darkness.
PRO 20:21 An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning, won’t be blessed in the end.
PRO 20:22 Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.” Wait for Adonai, and he will save you.
PRO 20:23 Adonai detests differing weights, and dishonest scales are not pleasing.
PRO 20:24 A man’s steps are from Adonai; how then can man understand his way?
PRO 20:25 It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, then later to consider his vows.
PRO 20:26 A wise king winnows out the wicked, and drives the threshing wheel over them.
PRO 20:27 The spirit of man is Adonai’s lamp candle, searching all his innermost parts.
PRO 20:28 Chesed ·Loving-kindness· and faithfulness keep the king safe. His throne is sustained by chesed ·loving-kindness·.
PRO 20:29 The glory of young men is their strength. The splendor of old men is their gray hair.
PRO 20:30 Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge the innermost parts.
PRO 21:1 The king’s heart is in Adonai’s hand like the watercourses. He turns it wherever he desires.
PRO 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Adonai weighs the hearts.
PRO 21:3 To do righteousness and mishpat ·justice· is more acceptable to Adonai than sacrifice.
PRO 21:4 A high look, and a proud heart, the lamp candle of the wicked, is habitual sin ·missing the mark·.
PRO 21:5 The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.
PRO 21:6 Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.
PRO 21:7 The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they refuse to do what is mishpat ·just·.
PRO 21:8 The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.
PRO 21:9 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than to share a house with a contentious woman.
PRO 21:10 The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no pity in his eyes.
PRO 21:11 When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
PRO 21:12 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings the wicked to ruin.
PRO 21:13 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.
PRO 21:14 A gift in secret pacifies anger; and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.
PRO 21:15 It is joy to the upright to do mishpat ·justice·; but it is a destruction to the workers of vain striving of iniquity.
PRO 21:16 The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.
PRO 21:17 He who 'ahav ·affectionately loves· pleasure shall be a poor man. He who 'ahav ·affectionately loves· wine and oil shall not be rich.
PRO 21:18 The wicked is a ransom for the upright; the treacherous for the upright.
PRO 21:19 It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and fretful woman.
PRO 21:20 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man swallows it up.
PRO 21:21 He who follows after righteousness and chesed ·loving-kindness· finds life, righteousness, and kavod ·weighty glory·.
PRO 21:22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down the strength of its confidence.
PRO 21:23 Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
PRO 21:24 The proud and haughty man, “scoffer” is his name; he works in the arrogance of pride.
PRO 21:25 The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor.
PRO 21:26 There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the upright give and don’t withhold.
PRO 21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!
PRO 21:28 A false witness will perish, and a man who sh'ma ·hears obeys· speaks to eternity.
PRO 21:29 A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.
PRO 21:30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Adonai.
PRO 21:31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory is with Adonai.
PRO 22:1 A good name is more desirable than great riches, and loving chen ·grace· is better than silver and gold.
PRO 22:2 The rich and the poor have this in common: Adonai is the maker of them all.
PRO 22:3 A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
PRO 22:4 The result of humility and the fear of Adonai is wealth, kavod ·weighty glory·, and life.
PRO 22:5 Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked: whoever guards his soul stays from them.
PRO 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.
PRO 22:7 The rich rule over the poor. The borrower is servant to the lender.
PRO 22:8 He who sows wickedness reaps vain striving of iniquity, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
PRO 22:9 He who has a generous eye will be blessed; for he shares his food with the poor.
PRO 22:10 Divorce the mocker, and strife will go out; yes, quarrels and insults will stop.
PRO 22:11 He who 'ahav ·affectionately loves· purity of heart and speaks chen ·gracefully· is the king’s friend.
PRO 22:12 Adonai’s eyes watch over knowledge; but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.
PRO 22:13 The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the streets!”
PRO 22:14 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit: he who is under Adonai’s wrath will fall into it.
PRO 22:15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child: the rod of discipline drives it far from him.
PRO 22:16 Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, both come to poverty.
PRO 22:17 Turn your ear, and sh'ma ·hear obey· the words of the wise. Apply your heart to my teaching.
PRO 22:18 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, if all of them are ready on your lips.
PRO 22:19 That your trust may be in Adonai, I teach you today, even you.
PRO 22:20 Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things of counsel and knowledge,
PRO 22:21 To teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?
PRO 22:22 Don’t exploit the poor, because he is poor; and don’t crush the needy in court;
PRO 22:23 for Adonai will plead their case, and plunder the life of those who plunder them.
PRO 22:24 Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man, and don’t associate with one who harbors anger:
PRO 22:25 lest you learn his ways, and ensnare your soul.
PRO 22:26 Don’t you be one of those who strike hands, of those who are collateral for debts.
PRO 22:27 If you don’t have means to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?
PRO 22:28 Don’t move the ancient boundary stone, which your fathers have set up.
PRO 22:29 Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve kings. He won’t serve obscure men.
PRO 23:1 When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you;
PRO 23:2 put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite.
PRO 23:3 Don’t be desirous of his dainties, since they are deceitful food.
PRO 23:4 Don’t weary yourself to be rich. In your wisdom, show restraint.
PRO 23:5 Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.
PRO 23:6 Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don’t crave his delicacies:
PRO 23:7 for as he thinks about the cost, so he is. “Eat and drink!” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
PRO 23:8 The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, and lose your good words.
PRO 23:9 Don’t speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
PRO 23:10 Don’t move the ancient boundary stone. Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless:
PRO 23:11 for their Defender is strong. He will plead their case against you.
PRO 23:12 Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge.
PRO 23:13 Don’t withhold correction from a child. If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.
PRO 23:14 Punish him with the rod, and save his soul from Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
PRO 23:15 My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine:
PRO 23:16 yes, my heart will rejoice, when your lips speak what is right.
PRO 23:17 Don’t let your heart envy people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal·; but rather fear Adonai all the day long.
PRO 23:18 Indeed surely there is a future hope, and your hope will not be cut off.
PRO 23:19 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path!
PRO 23:20 Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge themselves on meat:
PRO 23:21 for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
PRO 23:22 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· your father who gave you life, and don’t despise your mother when she is old.
PRO 23:23 Buy the truth, and don’t sell it. Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.
PRO 23:24 The father of the upright has great joy. Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.
PRO 23:25 Let your father and your mother be glad! Let her who bore you rejoice!
PRO 23:26 My son, give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways.
PRO 23:27 For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
PRO 23:28 Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the unfaithful among men.
PRO 23:29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
PRO 23:30 Those who stay long at the wine; those who go to seek out mixed wine.
PRO 23:31 Don’t look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.
PRO 23:32 In the end, it bites like a snake, and poisons like a viper.
PRO 23:33 Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will imagine confusing things.
PRO 23:34 Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea, or as he who lies on top of the rigging:
PRO 23:35 “They hit me, and I was not hurt! They beat me, and I don’t feel it! When will I wake up? I can do it again. I can find another.”
PRO 24:1 Don’t be envious of evil men; neither desire to be with them:
PRO 24:2 for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about mischief.
PRO 24:3 Through wisdom a house is built; by understanding it is established;
PRO 24:4 by knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare and beautiful treasure.
PRO 24:5 A wise man has great power; and a knowledgeable man increases strength;
PRO 24:6 for by wise guidance you wage your war; and victory is in many advisers.
PRO 24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he does not open his mouth in the gate.
PRO 24:8 One who plots to do evil will be called a schemer.
PRO 24:9 The schemes of folly are habitual sin ·missing the mark·. The mocker is detested by men.
PRO 24:10 If you falter in the time of trouble, your strength is small.
PRO 24:11 Rescue those who are being led away to death! Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!
PRO 24:12 If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this;” does not he who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, does not he know it? Surely he shall render to every man according to his work.
PRO 24:13 My son, eat honey, for it is good; the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:
PRO 24:14 so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; if you have found it, then there will be a reward, your hope will not be cut off.
PRO 24:15 Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the upright. Don’t destroy his resting place:
PRO 24:16 for a upright man falls seven times, and rises up again; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
PRO 24:17 Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls. Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown;
PRO 24:18 lest Adonai see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
PRO 24:19 Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers; neither be envious of the wicked:
PRO 24:20 for there will be no reward to the evil man; and the lamp candle of the wicked shall be snuffed out.
PRO 24:21 My son, fear Adonai and the king. Don’t join those who are rebellious:
PRO 24:22 for their calamity will rise suddenly; the destruction from them both— who knows?
PRO 24:23 These also are sayings of the wise. To show partiality in judgment is not good.
PRO 24:24 He who says to the wicked, “You are upright;” peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor him—
PRO 24:25 but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and a rich blessing will come on them.
PRO 24:26 An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.
PRO 24:27 Prepare your work outside, and get your fields ready. Afterwards, build your house.
PRO 24:28 Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause. Don’t deceive with your lips.
PRO 24:29 Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.”
PRO 24:30 I went by the field of the sluggard, by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
PRO 24:31 Behold, it was all grown over with thorns. Its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
PRO 24:32 Then I saw, and considered well. I saw, and received instruction:
PRO 24:33 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep;
PRO 24:34 so your poverty will come as a robber, and your want as an armed man.
PRO 25:1 These also are proverbs of Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense], which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah [Praised] copied out.
PRO 25:2 It is the kavod ·weighty glory· of God to conceal a thing, but the kavod ·weighty glory· of kings is to search out a matter.
PRO 25:3 As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
PRO 25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, and material comes out for the refiner;
PRO 25:5 Take away the wicked from the king’s presence, and his throne will be established in righteousness.
PRO 25:6 Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king, or claim a place among great men;
PRO 25:7 for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,” than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, whom your eyes have seen.
PRO 25:8 Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court. What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?
PRO 25:9 Debate your case with your neighbor, and don’t betray the confidence of another;
PRO 25:10 lest one who sh'ma ·hears obeys· it put you to shame, and your bad reputation never depart.
PRO 25:11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
PRO 25:12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is the reproof of the wise to an sh'ma ·hearing obedient· ear.
PRO 25:13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to those who send him; for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
PRO 25:14 As clouds and wind without rain, so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.
PRO 25:15 By patience a ruler is persuaded. A soft tongue breaks the bone.
PRO 25:16 Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, lest you eat too much, and vomit it.
PRO 25:17 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, lest he be weary of you, and hate you.
PRO 25:18 A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.
PRO 25:19 Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble is like a bad tooth, or a lame foot.
PRO 25:20 As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, or vinegar on soda, so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
PRO 25:21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat. If he is thirsty, give him water to drink:
PRO 25:22 for you will heap burning coals [of shame] on his head, and Adonai will reward you.
PRO 25:23 The north wind produces rain: so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.
PRO 25:24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than to share a house with a contentious woman.
PRO 25:25 Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
PRO 25:26 Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well, so is a upright man who gives way before the wicked.
PRO 25:27 It is not good to eat much honey; nor is it kavod ·weighty glory· to seek one’s own kavod ·weighty glory·.
PRO 25:28 Like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man whose spirit is without restraint.
PRO 26:1 Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so kavod ·weighty glory· is not fitting for a fool.
PRO 26:2 Like a fluttering sparrow, like a darting swallow, so the undeserved curse does not come to rest.
PRO 26:3 A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools!
PRO 26:4 Don’t answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him.
PRO 26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.
PRO 26:6 One who sends a message by the hand of a fool is cutting off feet and drinking violence.
PRO 26:7 Like the legs of the lame that hang loose: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
PRO 26:8 As one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives kavod ·weighty glory· to a fool.
PRO 26:9 Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
PRO 26:10 As an archer who wounds all, so is he who hires a fool or he who hires those who pass by.
PRO 26:11 As a dog that makes teshuvah ·completely returns· to his vomit, so is a fool who repeats his folly.
PRO 26:12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO 26:13 The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road! A fierce lion roams the streets!”
PRO 26:14 As the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.
PRO 26:15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
PRO 26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer with discretion.
PRO 26:17 Like one who grabs a dog’s ears is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.
PRO 26:18 Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,
PRO 26:19 is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?”
PRO 26:20 For lack of wood a fire goes out. Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.
PRO 26:21 As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindling strife.
PRO 26:22 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, they go down into the innermost parts.
PRO 26:23 Like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.
PRO 26:24 A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but he harbors evil in his heart.
PRO 26:25 When his speech is pleasant, don’t trust him; for there are seven abominations in his heart.
PRO 26:26 His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
PRO 26:27 Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
PRO 26:28 A lying tongue hates those it hurts; and a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO 27:1 Don’t boast about tomorrow; for you don’t know what a day may bring.
PRO 27:2 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.
PRO 27:3 A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.
PRO 27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able to stand before jealousy?
PRO 27:5 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
PRO 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a 'ahav ·affectionate lover, friend·; although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
PRO 27:7 A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.
PRO 27:8 As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his home.
PRO 27:9 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.
PRO 27:10 Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend. Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster: better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.
PRO 27:11 Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can answer my critics.
PRO 27:12 A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
PRO 27:13 Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. Hold it for a wayward woman!
PRO 27:14 He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse by him.
PRO 27:15 A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike:
PRO 27:16 restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping oil in his right hand.
PRO 27:17 Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.
PRO 27:18 Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honored.
PRO 27:19 Like water reflects a face, so a man’s heart reflects the man.
PRO 27:20 Sheol ·Place of the dead· and Abaddon ·bottomless pit· are never satisfied; and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.
PRO 27:21 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but man is refined by his praise.
PRO 27:22 Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.
PRO 27:23 Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds:
PRO 27:24 for riches are not forever, nor does even the crown endure to all generations.
PRO 27:25 The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses of the hills are gathered in.
PRO 27:26 The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of a field.
PRO 27:27 There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food, for your family’s food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
PRO 28:1 The wicked flee when no one pursues; but the upright are as bold as a lion.
PRO 28:2 In rebellious breach of relationship, a land has many rulers, but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.
PRO 28:3 A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.
PRO 28:4 Those who forsake the Torah ·Teaching· praise the wicked; but those who keep the Torah ·Teaching· contend with them.
PRO 28:5 Evil men don’t understand mishpat ·justice·; but those who seek Adonai understand it fully.
PRO 28:6 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.
PRO 28:7 Whoever keeps the Torah ·Teaching· is a wise son; but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.
PRO 28:8 He who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.
PRO 28:9 He who turns away his ear from sh'ma ·hearing obeying· the Torah ·Teaching·, even his prayer is an abomination.
PRO 28:10 Whoever causes the upright to be led astray, intoxicated, unintentional sin ·error· in an evil way, he will fall into his own trap; but the blameless will inherit good.
PRO 28:11 The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has understanding sees through him.
PRO 28:12 When the upright triumph, there is great glory; but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
PRO 28:13 He who conceals his rebellious breaches of relationships does not prosper, but whoever yadah ·extend hands in confession· and forsake renounces them finds racham ·merciful love·.
PRO 28:14 Blessed is the man who always fears; but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
PRO 28:15 As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.
PRO 28:16 A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.
PRO 28:17 A man who is tormented by life-blood will be a fugitive until the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol); no one will support him.
PRO 28:18 Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.
PRO 28:19 One who works his land will have an abundance of food; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
PRO 28:20 A faithful man is rich with blessings; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.
PRO 28:21 To show partiality is not good; yet a man will rebel to break away from authority thus breaking relationship for a piece of bread.
PRO 28:22 A stingy man hurries after riches, and does not know that poverty waits for him.
PRO 28:23 One who rebukes a man will afterward find more chen ·grace· than one who flatters with the tongue.
PRO 28:24 Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, “It’s not rebellious breach of relationship.” He is a partner with a destroyer.
PRO 28:25 One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one who trusts in Adonai will prosper.
PRO 28:26 One who trusts in himself is a fool; but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.
PRO 28:27 One who gives to the poor has no lack; but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.
PRO 28:28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the upright thrive.
PRO 29:1 He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.
PRO 29:2 When the upright thrive, the people rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people groan.
PRO 29:3 Whoever 'ahav ·affectionately loves· wisdom brings joy to his father; but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
PRO 29:4 The king by mishpat ·justice· makes the land stable, but he who takes bribes tears it down.
PRO 29:5 A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
PRO 29:6 An evil man is snared by his rebellious breach of relationship, but the upright can sing and be glad.
PRO 29:7 The upright care about justice for the poor. The wicked are not concerned about knowledge.
PRO 29:8 Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger.
PRO 29:9 If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.
PRO 29:10 The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; and they seek the life of the upright.
PRO 29:11 A fool vents all of his anger, but a wise man brings himself under control.
PRO 29:12 If a ruler listens to lies, all of his officials are wicked.
PRO 29:13 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: Adonai gives sight to the eyes of both.
PRO 29:14 The king who fairly judges the poor, his throne shall be established forever.
PRO 29:15 The rod of correction gives wisdom, but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.
PRO 29:16 When the wicked increase, rebellious breach of relationships increases; but the upright will see their downfall.
PRO 29:17 Correct your son, and he will give you peace; yes, he will bring delight to your soul.
PRO 29:18 Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but one who keeps the Torah ·Teaching· is blessed.
PRO 29:19 A servant can’t be corrected by words. Though he understands, yet he will not respond.
PRO 29:20 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO 29:21 He who pampers his servant from youth will have him become a son in the end.

PRO 29:26 Many seek the ruler’s favor, but a man’s mishpat ·justice· comes from Adonai.

PRO 30:1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the revelation: the man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
PRO 30:2 “Surely I am the most ignorant man, and don’t have a man’s understanding.
PRO 30:3 I have not learned wisdom, neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO 30:4 Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has bound the waters in his garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?
PRO 30:5 “Every d'var Elohim ·word of God· is flawless. He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
PRO 30:6 Don’t you add to his words, lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.
PRO 30:7 “Two things I have asked of you; don’t deny me before I die:
PRO 30:8 Remove far from me falsehood and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with the food that is chok ·portioned, needful· for me;
PRO 30:9 lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is Adonai?’ or lest I be poor, and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.
PRO 30:10 “Don’t slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be held condemned guilty.
PRO 30:11 There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
PRO 30:12 There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, yet are not washed from their filthiness.
PRO 30:13 There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! Their eyelids are lifted up.
PRO 30:14 There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, and their jaws like knives, to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from among men.
PRO 30:15 “The leach has two daughters: they cry, ‘Give, give.’ “There are three things that are never satisfied; four that don’t say, ‘Enough:’
PRO 30:16 Sheol ·Place of the dead·, the barren rachamim ·wombs / bowels of compassions·; the earth that is not satisfied with water; and the fire that does not say, ‘Enough.’
PRO 30:17 “The eye that mocks at his father, and scorns obedience to his mother: the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, the young eagles shall eat it.
PRO 30:18 “There are three things which are too amazing for me, four which I don’t understand:
PRO 30:19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock; the way of a ship in the middle of the sea; and the way of a man with a maiden.
PRO 30:20 “So is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats and wipes her mouth, and says, ‘I have done no vain striving of iniquity.’
PRO 30:21 “For three things the earth tremble, and under four, it can’t bear up:
PRO 30:22 For a servant when he is king; a fool when he is filled with food;
PRO 30:23 for an unloved (wife) when her husband takes her (back); and a servant who is heir to her mistress.
PRO 30:24 “There are four things which are little on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise:
PRO 30:25 the ants are not a strong people, yet they provide their food in the summer.
PRO 30:26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks.
PRO 30:27 The locusts have no king, yet they advance in ranks.
PRO 30:28 You can catch a lizard with your hands, yet it is in kings’ palaces.
PRO 30:29 “There are three things which are stately in their march, four which are stately in going:
PRO 30:30 The lion, which is mightiest among animals, and does not turn away for any;
PRO 30:31 the greyhound, the billy-goat and the king when his army is with him.
PRO 30:32 “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have thought evil, put your hand over your mouth.
PRO 30:33 For as the churning of milk produces butter, and the wringing of the nose produces blood; so the forcing of wrath produces strife.”
PRO 31:1 The words of king Lemuel; the revelation which his mother taught him.
PRO 31:2 “Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb! Oh, son of my vows!
PRO 31:3 Don’t give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
PRO 31:4 It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’
PRO 31:5 lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.
PRO 31:6 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; and wine to the bitter in soul:
PRO 31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.

ISA 1:1 The vision of Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah [Praised] and Jerusalem [City of peace], in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah [Praised].
ISA 1:2 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, heavens, and listen, earth; for Adonai has spoken: “I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled to break away from authority thus breaking relationship against me.
ISA 1:3 The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master’s crib; but Israel [God prevails] does not know, my people don’t consider.”
ISA 1:4 Ah sinnful ·deviant (from the standard goal)· nation, a people loaded with depravity (moral evil), offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Adonai. They have despised haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails]. They are estranged and backward.
ISA 1:5 Why should you be beaten more, that you revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
ISA 1:6 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it: wounds, welts, and open sores. They haven’t been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
ISA 1:7 Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Strangers devour your land in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
ISA 1:8 The daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city.
ISA 1:9 Unless Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] had left to us a very small remnant, we would have been as Sodom [Burning]; we would have been like Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants].
ISA 1:10 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· Adonai’s word, you rulers of Sodom [Burning]! Listen to the Torah ·Teaching· of our God, you people of Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants]!
ISA 1:11 “What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?,” says Adonai. “I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed animals. I don’t delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats.
ISA 1:12 When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
ISA 1:13 Bring no more vain offerings. Incense is an abomination to me; new moons, Shab'totay ·Intermissions·, and convocations: I can’t bear with vain striving of iniquity in assemblies.
ISA 1:14 My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to me. I am weary of bearing them.
ISA 1:15 When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not sh'ma ·hear obey·. Your hands are full of blood.
ISA 1:16 Wash yourselves, make yourself clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.
ISA 1:17 Learn to do well. Seek mishpat ·justice·. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the orphan. Plead for the widow.”
ISA 1:18 “Come now, and let us reason together,” says Adonai: “Though your crimes deserving peanlty, sins ·missing the goal· be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
ISA 1:19 If you are willing and sh'ma ·hearing obedient·, you shall eat the good of the land;
ISA 1:20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Adonai has spoken it.”
ISA 1:21 How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She was full of mishpat ·justice·; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
ISA 1:22 Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.
ISA 1:23 Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone 'ahav ·affectionately loves· bribes, and follows after rewards. They don’t judge the orphan, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
ISA 1:24 Therefore 'Adonay Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], the Mighty One of Israel [God prevails], says: “Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries, and avenge myself on my enemies;
ISA 1:25 and I will turn my hand on you, thoroughly purge away your dross, and will take away all your tin.
ISA 1:26 I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness, a faithful town.’
ISA 1:27 Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] shall be redeemed with mishpat ·justice·, and her converts with righteousness.
ISA 1:28 But the destruction of the rebellious who break away from authority thus breaking relationship and people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· shall be together, and those who forsake Adonai shall be consumed.
ISA 1:29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
ISA 1:30 For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.
ISA 1:31 The strong will be like tinder, and his work like a spark. They will both burn together, and no one will quench them.”
ISA 2:1 This is what Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah [Praised] and Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 2:2 It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Adonai ’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.
ISA 2:3 Many peoples shall go and say, “Come, let’s go up to the mountain of Adonai , to the house of the God of Jacob [Supplanter]; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For out of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] Torah ·Teaching· shall go forth, and Adonai ’s word from Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 2:4 He will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
ISA 2:5 House of Jacob [Supplanter], come, and let us walk in the light of Adonai.
ISA 2:6 For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob [Supplanter], because they are filled from the east, with those who practice divination like the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)], and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
ISA 2:7 Their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures. Their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.
ISA 2:8 Their land also is full of idols. They worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
ISA 2:9 Man is brought low, and mankind is humbled; therefore don’t forgive them.
ISA 2:10 Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, to escape from the terror of Adonai , and from the glory of his majesty.
ISA 2:11 The lofty looks of man will be brought low, the haughtiness of men will be bowed down, and Adonai alone will be exalted in that day.
ISA 2:12 For there will be a day of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] for all that is proud and haughty, and for all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low:
ISA 2:13 For all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, for all the oaks of Bashan,
ISA 2:14 For all the high mountains, for all the hills that are lifted up,
ISA 2:15 For every lofty tower, for every fortified wall,
ISA 2:16 For all the ships of Tarshish, and for all pleasant imagery.
ISA 2:17 The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Adonai alone shall be exalted in that day.
ISA 2:18 The idols shall utterly pass away.
ISA 2:19 Men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, to escape from the terror of Adonai , and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
ISA 2:20 In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
ISA 2:21 To go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, to escape from the terror of Adonai , and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
ISA 2:22 Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for of what account is he?
ISA 3:1 For, behold, Adon, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], takes away from Jerusalem [City of peace] and from Judah [Praised] supply and support, the whole supply of bread, and the whole supply of water;
ISA 3:2 the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet, the diviner, the elder,
ISA 3:3 the captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor, the skilled craftsman, and the clever enchanter.
ISA 3:4 I will give boys to be their princes, and children shall rule over them.
ISA 3:5 The people will be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone by his neighbor. The child will behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.
ISA 3:6 Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, “You have clothing, you be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand.”
ISA 3:7 In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. You shall not make me ruler of the people.”
ISA 3:8 For Jerusalem [City of peace] is ruined, and Judah [Praised] is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Adonai, to provoke the eyes of his kavod ·weighty glory·.
ISA 3:9 The look of their faces testify against them. They parade their habitual sin ·missing the mark· like Sodom [Burning]. They don’t hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
ISA 3:10 Tell the upright “Good!” For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
ISA 3:11 Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them; for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.
ISA 3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people, those who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.
ISA 3:13 Adonai stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.
ISA 3:14 Adonai will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and their leaders: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses.
ISA 3:15 What do you mean that you crush my people, and grind the face of the poor?” says 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies].
ISA 3:16 Moreover Adonai said, “Because the daughters of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes, walking to trip as they go, jingling ornaments on their feet;
ISA 3:17 therefore 'Adonay [Lord] brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and Adonai will make their scalps bald.”
ISA 3:18 In that day 'Adonay [Lord] will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,
ISA 3:19 the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
ISA 3:20 the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms,
ISA 3:21 the signet rings, the nose rings,
ISA 3:22 the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
ISA 3:23 the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.
ISA 3:24 It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well set hair, baldness; instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
ISA 3:25 Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.
ISA 3:26 Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.
ISA 4:1 Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing: only let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach.”
ISA 4:2 In that day, Adonai’s branch will be beautiful and kavod ·weighty glorious·, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and excellent for the survivors of Israel [God prevails].
ISA 4:3 It will happen, that he who is left in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and he who remains in Jerusalem [City of peace], shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem [City of peace];
ISA 4:4 when 'Adonay [Lord] shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem [City of peace] from within it, by the spirit of mishpat ·justice·, and by the spirit of burning.
ISA 4:5 Adonai will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the kavod ·weighty glory· will be a canopy.
ISA 4:6 There will be a sukkah ·temporary tent· for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
ISA 5:1 Let me sing for my yadid ·beloved· a song of my dod ·beloved lover· about his vineyard. My yadid ·beloved· had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
ISA 5:2 He dug it up, gathered out its stones, planted it with the choicest vine, built a tower in the middle of it, and also cut out a wine press therein. He looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.
ISA 5:3 “Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem [City of peace] and men of Judah [Praised], please judge between me and my vineyard.
ISA 5:4 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?
ISA 5:5 Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up. I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.
ISA 5:6 I will lay it a wasteland. It won’t be pruned nor hoed, but it will grow briers and thorns. I will also enjoin the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”
ISA 5:7 For the vineyard of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is the house of Israel [God prevails], and the men of Judah [Praised] his pleasant plant: and he looked for mishpat ·justice·, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.
ISA 5:8 Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field, until there is no room, and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!
ISA 5:9 In my ears, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] says: “Surely many houses will be desolate, even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
ISA 5:10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath [6 hins; 5.9 gal; 22 L], and a homer [6.33 bushels; 59 gal; 220 L] of seed shall yield an ephah [0.63 bushels; 5.9 gal; 22 L].”
ISA 5:11 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!
ISA 5:12 The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts; but they don’t respect the work of Adonai, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
ISA 5:13 Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge. Their honorable men are famished, and their multitudes are parched with thirst.
ISA 5:14 Therefore Sheol ·Place of the dead· has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without chok ·portion·; and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.
ISA 5:15 So man is brought low, mankind is humbled, and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;
ISA 5:16 but Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is exalted in mishpat ·justice·, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
ISA 5:17 Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.
ISA 5:18 Woe to those who draw depravity (moral evil) with cords of falsehood, and wickedness as with cart rope;
ISA 5:19 Who say, “Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails] draw near and come, that we may know it!”
ISA 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
ISA 5:21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
ISA 5:22 Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and champions at mixing strong drink;
ISA 5:23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice for the innocent!
ISA 5:24 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the Torah ·Teaching· of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], and despised the word of haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 5:25 Therefore Adonai’s anger burns against his people, and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them. The mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets. For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is still stretched out.
ISA 5:26 He will lift up a banner to the nations from far, and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth. Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.
ISA 5:27 No one shall be weary nor stumble among them; no one shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied, nor the strap of their sandals be broken:
ISA 5:28 whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent. Their horses’ hoofs will be like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.
ISA 5:29 Their roaring will be like a lioness. They will roar like young lions. Yes, they shall roar, and seize their prey and carry it off, and there will be no one to deliver.
ISA 5:30 They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress. The light is darkened in its clouds.
ISA 6:1 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw 'Adonay [Lord] sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
ISA 6:2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.
ISA 6:3 One called to another, and said, “More holy than the holiest holiness is Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]! The whole earth is full of his kavod ·weighty glory·!”
ISA 6:4 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
ISA 6:5 Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]!”
ISA 6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
ISA 6:7 He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your depravity (moral evil) is taken away, and your habitual sin ·missing the mark· forgiven.”
ISA 6:8 I sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of 'Adonay [Lord], saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”
ISA 6:9 He said, ‘Go, and tell this people, “You sh'ma ·hear obey· sh'ma ·hear obey· yet still don’t understand; and you indeed see, but don’t perceive.”
ISA 6:10 Make the heart of this people fat. Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and sh'ma ·hear obey· with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.’
ISA 6:11 Then I said, “Lord, how long?” He answered, “Until cities are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land becomes utterly waste,
ISA 6:12 And Adonai has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are many within the land.
ISA 6:13 If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled; so the holy seed is its stock.”
ISA 7:1 In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah [Praised], Rezin the king of Syria [Elevated], and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel [God prevails], went up to Jerusalem [City of peace] to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
ISA 7:2 David [Beloved]’s house was told, “Syria [Elevated] is allied with Ephraim [Fruit].” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
ISA 7:3 Then Adonai said to Isaiah [Salvation of Yah], “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field.
ISA 7:4 Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria [Elevated], and of the son of Remaliah.
ISA 7:5 Because Syria [Elevated], Ephraim [Fruit], and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying,
ISA 7:6 “Let’s go up against Judah [Praised], and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.”
ISA 7:7 This is what 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.”
ISA 7:8 For the head of Syria [Elevated] is Damascus [Bucket of blood], and the head of Damascus [Bucket of blood] is Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim [Fruit] shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people;
ISA 7:9 and the head of Ephraim [Fruit] is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not trust, surely you shall not be established.’”
ISA 7:10 Adonai spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
ISA 7:11 “Ask a sign of Adonai your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.”
ISA 7:12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, neither will I tempt Adonai.”
ISA 7:13 He said, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· now, house of David [Beloved]. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also?
ISA 7:14 Therefore 'Adonay [Lord] himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name 'Immanu El [God is with us].
ISA 7:15 He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
ISA 7:16 For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.
ISA 7:17 Adonai will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim [Fruit] departed from Judah [Praised]; even the king of Assyria [Level plain].
ISA 7:18 It will happen in that day that Adonai will whistle for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria [Level plain].
ISA 7:19 They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures.
ISA 7:20 In that day 'Adonay [Lord] will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria [Level plain], the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.
ISA 7:21 It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;
ISA 7:22 and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left within the land.
ISA 7:23 It will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels [25 lb; 11.34 kg], shall be for briers and thorns.
ISA 7:24 People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns.
ISA 7:25 All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.”
ISA 8:1 Adonai said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘For Maher Shalal Hash Baz’;
ISA 8:2 and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah [My light Yah] the priest, and Zechariah [Remembered by Yah] the son of Jeberechiah.”
ISA 8:3 I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Adonai said to me, “Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’
ISA 8:4 For before the child knows how to say, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus [Bucket of blood] and the plunder of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria [Level plain].”
ISA 8:5 Adonai spoke to me yet again, saying,
ISA 8:6 “Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;
ISA 8:7 now therefore, behold, 'Adonay [Lord] brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria [Level plain] and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.
ISA 8:8 It will sweep onward into Judah [Praised]. It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the width of your land, 'Immanu El [God is with us].
ISA 8:9 Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be shattered!
ISA 8:10 Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will not stand: for God is with us.”
ISA 8:11 For Adonai spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
ISA 8:12 “Don’t say, ‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say, ‘A conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized.
ISA 8:13 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is who you must respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must dread.
ISA 8:14 He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel [God prevails], he will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 8:15 Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared, and be captured.”
ISA 8:16 Wrap up the testimony. Seal the Torah ·Teaching· among my disciples.
ISA 8:17 I will wait for Adonai, who hides his face from the house of Jacob [Supplanter], and I will trust in him.
ISA 8:18 Behold, I and the children whom Adonai has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel [God prevails] from Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], who dwells in Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
ISA 8:19 When they tell you, “Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:” should not a people consult with their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?
ISA 8:20 Turn to the Torah ·Teaching· and to the testimony! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.
ISA 8:21 They will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward,
ISA 8:22 and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness.
ISA 9:1 But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun [Living together] and the land of Naphtali [My wrestling]; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan [Descender], Galilee [District, Circuit] of the nations.
ISA 9:2 The people living in darkness have seen a great light. Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light has shined.
ISA 9:3 You have multiplied the nation. You have increased their joy. They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder.
ISA 9:4 For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian [Strife].
ISA 9:5 For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire.
ISA 9:6 For to us a child is born. To us a son is given; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Peleh-Yo 'etz [Wonderful-Counselor], El Gibbor [Mighty God], Avi-'Ad [Everlasting Father], Sar-Shalom [Prince of Peace].
ISA 9:7 The increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on David [Beloved]’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with mishpat ·justice· and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will perform this.
ISA 9:8 'Adonay [Lord] sent a word into Jacob [Supplanter], and it falls on Israel [God prevails].
ISA 9:9 All the people will know, including Ephraim [Fruit] and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
ISA 9:10 “The bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stone. The sycamore fig trees have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.”
ISA 9:11 Therefore Adonai will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,
ISA 9:12 The Syrians in front, and the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] behind; and they will devour Israel [God prevails] with open mouth. For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA 9:13 Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them, neither have they sought Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies].
ISA 9:14 Therefore Adonai will cut off from Israel [God prevails] head and tail, palm branch and reed, in one day.
ISA 9:15 The elder and the honorable man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.
ISA 9:16 For those who lead this people lead them astray; and those who are led by them are destroyed.
ISA 9:17 Therefore 'Adonay [Lord] will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have racham ·compassionate merciful love· on their orphans and widows; for everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA 9:18 For wickedness burns like a fire. It devours the briers and thorns; yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
ISA 9:19 Through Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]’ wrath, the land is burned up; and the people are the fuel for the fire. No one spares his brother.
ISA 9:20 One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied. Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:
ISA 9:21 Manasseh [Causing to forget], Ephraim [Fruit]; and Ephraim [Fruit], Manasseh [Causing to forget]; and they together shall be against Judah [Praised]. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA 10:1 Woe to those who decree vain striving of iniquity decrees, and to the writers who write oppressive decrees;
ISA 10:2 to deprive the needy of their rights, and to rob the poor among my people of mishpat ·justice·, that widows may be their plunder, and that they may make the orphans their prey!
ISA 10:3 What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your kavod ·weighty glory·?
ISA 10:4 They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA 10:5 Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!
ISA 10:6 I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people who anger me will I give him an enjoinment to take the plunder and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
ISA 10:7 However he does not mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.
ISA 10:8 For he says, “Are not all of my princes kings?
ISA 10:9 Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus [Bucket of blood]?”
ISA 10:10 As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem [City of peace] and of Samaria;
ISA 10:11 shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem [City of peace] and her idols?
ISA 10:12 Therefore it will happen that, when 'Adonay [Lord] has performed his whole work on Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] and on Jerusalem [City of peace], I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria [Level plain], and the insolence of his haughty looks.
ISA 10:13 For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.
ISA 10:14 My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, have I gathered all the earth. There was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.”
ISA 10:15 Should an ax brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood.
ISA 10:16 Therefore 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his kavod ·weighty glory· a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire.
ISA 10:17 The light of Israel [God prevails] will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.
ISA 10:18 He will consume the kavod ·weighty glory· of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints.
ISA 10:19 The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.
ISA 10:20 It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel [God prevails], and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob [Supplanter] will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Adonai, haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], in truth.
ISA 10:21 A remnant will make teshuvah ·complete return·, even the remnant of Jacob [Supplanter], to the mighty God.
ISA 10:22 For though your people, Israel [God prevails], are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
ISA 10:23 For 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], will make a full end, and that determined, throughout all the earth.
ISA 10:24 Therefore 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], says “My people who dwell in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Egypt [Abode of slavery] did.
ISA 10:25 For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.”
ISA 10:26 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian [Strife] at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt [Abode of slavery].
ISA 10:27 It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
ISA 10:28 He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage.
ISA 10:29 They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul [Asked for] has fled.
ISA 10:30 Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth!
ISA 10:31 Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
ISA 10:32 This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], the hill of Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 10:33 Behold, Adon, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
ISA 10:34 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
ISA 11:1 A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse [My husband], and a netzer ·branch· out of his roots will bear fruit.
ISA 11:2 Ruach Yahweh [Spirit, Breath of He sustains breathing] will rest on him: the ruach ·spirit, breath· of wisdom and understanding, the ruach ·spirit, breath· of counsel and might, the ruach ·spirit, breath· of knowledge and of the fear of Adonai .
ISA 11:3 His delight will be in the fear of Adonai . He will not judge by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing of his ears;
ISA 11:4 but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide with equity for the humble of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.
ISA 11:5 Justice will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his waist.
ISA 11:6 The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat; The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf together; and a little child will lead them.
ISA 11:7 The cow and the bear will graze. Their young ones will lie down together. The lion will eat straw like the ox.
ISA 11:8 The nursing child will play near a cobra’s hole, and the weaned child will put his hand on the viper’s den.
ISA 11:9 They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Adonai, as the waters cover the sea.
ISA 11:10 It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse [My husband], who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be kavod ·weighty glorious·.
ISA 11:11 It will happen in that day that 'Adonay [Lord] will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria [Level plain], from Egypt [Abode of slavery], from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
ISA 11:12 He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel [God prevails], and gather together the dispersed of Judah [Praised] from the four corners of the earth.
ISA 11:13 The envy also of Ephraim [Fruit] will depart, and those who persecute Judah [Praised] will be cut off. Ephraim [Fruit] won’t envy Judah [Praised], and Judah [Praised] won’t persecute Ephraim [Fruit].
ISA 11:14 They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] on the west. Together they will plunder the children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom [Red] and Moab [From father], and the children of Ammon [Tribal people] will obey them.
ISA 11:15 Adonai will utterly destroy the tongue of the Sea of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march over in sandals.
ISA 11:16 There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria [Level plain], like there was for Israel [God prevails] in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
ISA 12:1 In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, Adonai; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.
ISA 12:2 Behold, God is my yishu'ah ·salvation·. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Adonai, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.”
ISA 12:3 Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of yishu'ah ·salvation·.
ISA 12:4 In that day you will say, “Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!
ISA 12:5 Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!
ISA 12:6 Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]; for haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails] is great among you!”
ISA 13:1 The burden of Babylon [Confusion], which Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the son of Amoz saw:
ISA 13:2 Set up a banner on the bare mountain! Lift up your voice to them! Wave your hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
ISA 13:3 I have enjoined my consecrated ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.
ISA 13:4 The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is mustering the army for the battle.
ISA 13:5 They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even Adonai, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.
ISA 13:6 Wail; for the day of Adonai is at hand! It will come as destruction from Shaddai [Almighty].
ISA 13:7 Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone’s heart will melt.
ISA 13:8 They will be dismayed. Pangs and sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labor. They will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame.
ISA 13:9 Behold, the day of Adonai comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· out of it.
ISA 13:10 For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its going out, and the moon will not cause its light to shine.
ISA 13:11 I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their depravity (moral evil). I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible.
ISA 13:12 I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir.
ISA 13:13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]’ wrath, and in the day of his fierce anger.
ISA 13:14 It will happen that like a hunted gazelle, and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people, and will each flee to their own land.
ISA 13:15 Everyone who is found will be thrust through. Everyone who is captured will fall by the sword.
ISA 13:16 Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped.
ISA 13:17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes [Middle-land] against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it.
ISA 13:18 Their bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no racham ·compassionate love· on the fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children.
ISA 13:19 Babylon [Confusion], the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' [Descendants of Loving-kindness] pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants].
ISA 13:20 It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.
ISA 13:21 But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there.
ISA 13:22 Wolves will cry in their fortresses, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.
ISA 14:1 For Adonai will have racham ·compassionate love· on Jacob [Supplanter], and will yet choose Israel [God prevails], and set them in their own land. The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite with the house of Jacob [Supplanter].
ISA 14:2 The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Israel [God prevails] will possess them in Adonai’s land for servants and for handmaids. They will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
ISA 14:3 It will happen in the day that Adonai will give you rest from your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to serve,
ISA 14:4 that you will take up this parable against the king of Babylon [Confusion], and say, “How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!”
ISA 14:5 Adonai has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers,
ISA 14:6 who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that no one restrained.
ISA 14:7 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet. They break out song.
ISA 14:8 Yes, the cypress trees rejoice with you, with the cedars of Lebanon, saying, “Since you are humbled, no lumberjack has come up against us.”
ISA 14:9 Sheol ·Place of the dead· from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the departed spirits for you, even all the rulers of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
ISA 14:10 They all will answer and ask you, “Have you also become as weak as we are? Have you become like us?”
ISA 14:11 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol ·Place of the dead·, with the sound of your stringed instruments. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you.
ISA 14:12 How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low!
ISA 14:13 You said in your heart, “I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north!
ISA 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like haElyon [the Most High]!”
ISA 14:15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol ·Place of the dead·, to the depths of the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol).
ISA 14:16 Those who see you will stare at you. They will ponder you, saying, “Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms;
ISA 14:17 who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities; who didn’t release his prisoners to their home?”
ISA 14:18 All the kings of the nations, sleep in glory, everyone in his own house.
ISA 14:19 But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol); like a dead body trodden under foot.
ISA 14:20 You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will not be named forever.
ISA 14:21 Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the depravity (moral evil) of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities.
ISA 14:22 “I will rise up against them,” says Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], “and cut off from Babylon [Confusion] name and remnant, and son and son’s son,” says Adonai.
ISA 14:23 “I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies].
ISA 14:24 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] has sworn, saying, “Surely, as I have thought, so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:
ISA 14:25 that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders.
ISA 14:26 This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.
ISA 14:27 For Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] has planned, and who can stop it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?”
ISA 14:28 This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.
ISA 14:29 Don’t rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent’s root an adder will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.
ISA 14:30 The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed.
ISA 14:31 Howl, gate! Cry, city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.
ISA 14:32 What will they answer the messengers of the nation? That Adonai has founded Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and in her the afflicted of his people will take refuge.
ISA 15:1 The burden of Moab [From father]: for in a night, Ar of Moab [From father] is laid waste, and brought to nothing; for in a night Kir of Moab [From father] is laid waste, and brought to nothing.
ISA 15:2 They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab [From father] wails over Nebo and over Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every beard is cut off.
ISA 15:3 In their streets, they clothe themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails, weeping abundantly.
ISA 15:4 Heshbon cries out with Elealeh. Their voice is sh'ma ·heard obeyed· even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab [From father] cry aloud. Their souls tremble within them.
ISA 15:5 My heart cries out for Moab [From father]! Her nobles flee to Zoar [Small], to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for on the way to Horonaim, they raise up a cry of destruction.
ISA 15:6 For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.
ISA 15:7 Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows.
ISA 15:8 For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab [From father]; its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.
ISA 15:9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab [From father] who escape, and on the remnant of the land.
ISA 16:1 Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude· to the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
ISA 16:2 For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the daughters of Moab [From father] be at the fords of the Arnon.
ISA 16:3 Give counsel! Execute justice! Make your shade like the night in the middle of the noonday! Hide the outcasts! Don’t betray the fugitive!
ISA 16:4 Let my outcasts dwell with you! As for Moab [From father], be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortionist is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land.
ISA 16:5 A throne will be established in chesed ·loving-kindness·. One will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David [Beloved], judging, seeking mishpat ·justice·, and swift to do righteousness.
ISA 16:6 We have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of the pride of Moab [From father], that he is very proud; even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing.
ISA 16:7 Therefore Moab [From father] will wail for Moab [From father]. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth, utterly stricken.
ISA 16:8 For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea.
ISA 16:9 Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen.
ISA 16:10 Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread out wine in the presses. I have made the shouting stop.
ISA 16:11 Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab [From father], and my inward parts for Kir Heres.
ISA 16:12 It will happen that when Moab [From father] presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail.
ISA 16:13 This is the word that Adonai spoke concerning Moab [From father] in time past.
ISA 16:14 But now Adonai has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as a worker bound by contract would count them, the glory of Moab [From father] shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant will be very small and feeble.”
ISA 17:1 The burden of Damascus [Bucket of blood]: “Behold, Damascus [Bucket of blood] is taken away from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.
ISA 17:2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks, which shall lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.
ISA 17:3 The fortress shall cease from Ephraim [Fruit], and the kingdom from Damascus [Bucket of blood], and the remnant of Syria [Elevated]. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel [God prevails],” says Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies].
ISA 17:4 “It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob [Supplanter] will be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
ISA 17:5 It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps the grain. Yes, it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim [Descendants of Terrible one].
ISA 17:6 Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,” says Yahweh, Elohim Isra'el [He sustains breathing, God of God prevails].
ISA 17:7 In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes will have respect for haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 17:8 They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made, either the Asherah poles, or the incense altars.
ISA 17:9 In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel [God prevails]; and it will be a desolation.
ISA 17:10 For you have forgotten the God of your yesha' ·salvation·, and have not remembered the rock of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings.
ISA 17:11 In the day of your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
ISA 17:12 Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!
ISA 17:13 The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters: but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.
ISA 17:14 At evening, behold, terror! Before the morning, they are no more. This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.
ISA 18:1 Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;
ISA 18:2 that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in papyrus-reed boats on the waters, saying, “Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide!”
ISA 18:3 All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth, when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look! When the shofar ·ram horn· is blown, sh'ma ·hear obey·!
ISA 18:4 For Adonai said to me, “I will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
ISA 18:5 For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.
ISA 18:6 They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the animals of the earth will winter on them.
ISA 18:7 In that time, a present will be brought to Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
ISA 19:1 The burden of Egypt [Abode of slavery]: “Behold, Adonai rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt [Abode of slavery]. The idols of Egypt [Abode of slavery] will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt [Abode of slavery] will melt within it.
ISA 19:2 I will stir up the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] against the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery], and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
ISA 19:3 The spirit of Egypt [Abode of slavery] will fail within it. I will destroy its counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.
ISA 19:4 I will give over the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,” says, Adon, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies].
ISA 19:5 The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.
ISA 19:6 The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt [Abode of slavery] will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.
ISA 19:7 The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.
ISA 19:8 The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.
ISA 19:9 Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.
ISA 19:10 The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.
ISA 19:11 The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?”
ISA 19:12 Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] has purposed concerning Egypt [Abode of slavery].
ISA 19:13 The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt [Abode of slavery] to go astray, who are the corner-stone of her tribes.
ISA 19:14 Adonai has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt [Abode of slavery] to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
ISA 19:15 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt [Abode of slavery], which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.
ISA 19:16 In that day the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]’s hand, which he shakes over them.
ISA 19:17 The land of Judah [Praised] will become a terror to Egypt [Abode of slavery]. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], which he determines against it.
ISA 19:18 In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery] that speak the language of Canaan [Humbled], and swear to Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies]. One will be called “The city of destruction.”
ISA 19:19 In that day, there will be an altar to Adonai in the middle of the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and a pillar to Adonai at its border.
ISA 19:20 It will be for a sign and for a witness to Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; for they will cry to Adonai because of oppressors, and he will send them one to save and a defend them, and he will deliver them.
ISA 19:21 Adonai will be known to Egypt [Abode of slavery], and the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] will know Adonai in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Adonai, and will perform it.
ISA 19:22 Adonai will strike Egypt [Abode of slavery], striking and healing. They will make teshuvah ·complete return· to Adonai, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.
ISA 19:23 In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to Assyria [Level plain], and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt [Abode of slavery], and the Egyptian [person from Abode of slavery] into Assyria [Level plain]; and the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] will worship with the Assyrians.
ISA 19:24 In that day, Israel [God prevails] will be the third with Egypt [Abode of slavery] and with Assyria [Level plain], a blessing within the earth;
ISA 19:25 because Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] has blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt [Abode of slavery] my people, Assyria [Level plain] the work of my hands, and Israel [God prevails] my inheritance.”
ISA 20:1 In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria [Level plain] sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;
ISA 20:2 at that time Adonai spoke by Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist, and take your shoes from off your feet.” He did so, walking naked and barefoot.
ISA 20:3 Adonai said, “As my servant Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt [Abode of slavery] and concerning Ethiopia,
ISA 20:4 so the king of Assyria [Level plain] will lead away the captives of Egypt [Abode of slavery] and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
ISA 20:5 They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt [Abode of slavery] their glory.
ISA 20:6 The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria [Level plain]. And we, how will we escape?’”
ISA 21:1 The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.
ISA 21:2 A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media [Middle-land]’s sighing.
ISA 21:3 Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t sh'ma ·hear obey·. I so am dismayed that I can’t see.
ISA 21:4 My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.
ISA 21:5 They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!
ISA 21:6 For 'Adonay [Lord] said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.
ISA 21:7 When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.”
ISA 21:8 He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.
ISA 21:9 Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon [Confusion]; and all the engraved images of her deities are broken to the ground.
ISA 21:10 You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· from Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], the God of Israel [God prevails], I have declared to you.
ISA 21:11 The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”
ISA 21:12 The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.”
ISA 21:13 The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.
ISA 21:14 They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.
ISA 21:15 For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.
ISA 21:16 For 'Adonay [Lord] said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,
ISA 21:17 and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, Elohim Isra'el [He sustains breathing, God of God prevails], has spoken it.”
ISA 22:1 The burden of the valley of vision. What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?
ISA 22:2 You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.
ISA 22:3 All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away.
ISA 22:4 Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
ISA 22:5 For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.”
ISA 22:6 Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.
ISA 22:7 Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.
ISA 22:8 He took away the covering of Judah [Praised]; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.
ISA 22:9 You saw the breaches of David [Beloved]’s city, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
ISA 22:10 You counted the houses of Jerusalem [City of peace], and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.
ISA 22:11 You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago.
ISA 22:12 In that day, 'Adonay Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth:
ISA 22:13 and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.”
ISA 22:14 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] revealed himself in my ears, “Surely this depravity (moral evil) will not be forgiven you until you die,” says 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies].
ISA 22:15 Thus says 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], “Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,
ISA 22:16 ‘What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?’ Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!”
ISA 22:17 Behold, Adonai will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly.
ISA 22:18 He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame of your lord’s house.
ISA 22:19 I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.
ISA 22:20 It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
ISA 22:21 and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem [City of peace], and to the house of Judah [Praised].
ISA 22:22 I will lay the key of David [Beloved]’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.
ISA 22:23 I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father’s house.
ISA 22:24 They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.
ISA 22:25 “In that day,” says Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], “the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way. It will be cut down, and fall. The burden that was on it will be cut off, for Adonai has spoken it.”
ISA 23:1 The burden of Tyre. Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
ISA 23:2 Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
ISA 23:3 On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue. She was the market of nations.
ISA 23:4 Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed, nor given birth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.”
ISA 23:5 When the report comes to Egypt [Abode of slavery], they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.
ISA 23:6 Pass over to Tarshish! Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!
ISA 23:7 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel?
ISA 23:8 Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?
ISA 23:9 Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
ISA 23:10 Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no restraint any more.
ISA 23:11 He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. Adonai has enjoined the destruction of Canaan [Humbled]’s strongholds.
ISA 23:12 He said, “You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.”
ISA 23:13 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans [Descendants of Loving-kindness]. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin.
ISA 23:14 Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!
ISA 23:15 It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute.
ISA 23:16 Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered.
ISA 23:17 It will happen after the end of seventy years that Adonai will visit Tyre, and she shall make teshuvah ·complete return· to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth.
ISA 23:18 Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Adonai. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before Adonai, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
ISA 24:1 Behold, Adonai makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.
ISA 24:2 It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.
ISA 24:3 The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Adonai has spoken this word.
ISA 24:4 The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.
ISA 24:5 The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the torot ·teachings·, changed the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.
ISA 24:6 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found condemned guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
ISA 24:7 The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.
ISA 24:8 The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.
ISA 24:9 They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.
ISA 24:10 The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.
ISA 24:11 There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.
ISA 24:12 The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.
ISA 24:13 For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.
ISA 24:14 These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Adonai. They cry aloud from the sea.
ISA 24:15 Therefore glorify Adonai in the east, even the name of Yahweh, Elohim Isra'el [He sustains breathing, God of God prevails], in the islands of the sea!
ISA 24:16 From the uttermost part of the earth have we sh'ma ·heard obeyed· songs. Glory to the upright! But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.
ISA 24:17 Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.
ISA 24:18 It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
ISA 24:19 The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.
ISA 24:20 The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its rebellious breach of relationship will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.
ISA 24:21 It shall happen in that day that Adonai will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.
ISA 24:22 They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol), and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.
ISA 24:23 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will reign on Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and in Jerusalem [City of peace]; and before his elders will be kavod ·weighty glory·.
ISA 25:1 Adonai, you are my God. I will exalt you! I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth.
ISA 25:2 For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built.
ISA 25:3 Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.
ISA 25:4 For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.
ISA 25:5 As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.
ISA 25:6 In this mountain, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will make all peoples a feast of choice meat, a feast of choice wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.
ISA 25:7 He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.
ISA 25:8 He has swallowed up death forever! 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Adonai has spoken it.
ISA 25:9 It shall be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us! This is Adonai! We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his yishu'ah ·salvation·!”
ISA 25:10 For in this mountain Adonai’s hand will rest. Moab [From father] will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.
ISA 25:11 He will spread out his hands in the middle of it, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands.
ISA 25:12 He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
ISA 26:1 In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah [Praised]: “We have a strong city. God appoints yishu'ah ·salvation· for walls and bulwarks.
ISA 26:2 Open the gates, that the upright nation may enter: the one which keeps faith.
ISA 26:3 You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace, because he trusts in you.
ISA 26:4 Trust in Adonai forever; for in Yah, Adonai, is an everlasting Rock.
ISA 26:5 For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city. He lays it low. He lays it low even to the ground. He brings it even to the dust.
ISA 26:6 The foot shall tread it down; Even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.”
ISA 26:7 The way of the just is uprightness. You who are upright make the path of the upright level.
ISA 26:8 Yes, in the way of your judgments, Adonai, have we waited for you. Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.
ISA 26:9 With my soul have I desired you in the night. Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly; for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
ISA 26:10 Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not see Adonai’s majesty.
ISA 26:11 Adonai, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see; but they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed. Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.
ISA 26:12 Adonai, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also done all our work for us.
ISA 26:13 Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God], other lords besides you have had dominion over us, but by you only will we make mention of your name.
ISA 26:14 The dead shall not live. The departed spirits shall not rise. Therefore you have visited and destroyed them, and caused all memory of them to perish.
ISA 26:15 You have increased the nation, O Adonai. You have increased the nation! You are glorified! You have enlarged all the borders of the land.
ISA 26:16 Adonai, in trouble they have visited you. They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.
ISA 26:17 Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs; so we have been before you, Adonai.
ISA 26:18 We have been with child. We have been in pain. We gave birth, it seems, only to wind. We have not worked any yishu'ah ·deliverance· in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
ISA 26:19 Your dead shall live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.
ISA 26:20 Come, my people, enter into your rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a little moment, until the indignation is past.
ISA 26:21 For, behold, Adonai comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their depravity (moral evil). The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.
ISA 27:1 In that day, Adonai with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.
ISA 27:2 In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard!
ISA 27:3 I, Adonai, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.
ISA 27:4 Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.
ISA 27:5 Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”
ISA 27:6 In days to come, Jacob [Supplanter] will take root. Israel [God prevails] will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.
ISA 27:7 Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?
ISA 27:8 In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.
ISA 27:9 Therefore by this the depravity (moral evil) of Jacob [Supplanter] will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his habitual sin ·missing the mark·: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.
ISA 27:10 For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.
ISA 27:11 When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have racham ·compassionate love· on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.
ISA 27:12 It will happen in that day, that Adonai will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates [Fruitful] to the brook of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel [God prevails].
ISA 27:13 It will happen in that day that a great shofar ·ram horn· will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria [Level plain], and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery], shall come; and they will worship Adonai in the holy mountain at Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 28:1 Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim [Fruit], and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!
ISA 28:2 Behold, 'Adonay [Lord] has a mighty and strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.
ISA 28:3 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim [Fruit] will be trodden under foot.
ISA 28:4 The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it.
ISA 28:5 In that day, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will become a crown of glory, and a diadem ·crown· of beauty, to the residue of his people;
ISA 28:6 and a spirit of mishpat ·justice· to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
ISA 28:7 They are lead astray, intoxicated, unintentional sin ·error· with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet are lead astray, intoxicated, unintentional sin ·error· with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink. They are lead astray, intoxicated, unintentional sin ·error· in vision. They stumble in judgment.
ISA 28:8 For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.
ISA 28:9 Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?
ISA 28:10 For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.
ISA 28:11 But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language;
ISA 28:12 to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to weary;” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not sh'ma ·hear obey·.
ISA 28:13 Therefore Adonai’s word will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken, be snared, and be taken.
ISA 28:14 Therefore sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem [City of peace]:
ISA 28:15 “Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with death, and with Sheol ·Place of the dead· are we in agreement. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’”
ISA 28:16 Therefore thus says 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], “Behold, I lay in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] for a foundation stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone of a sure foundation. He who trusts shall not act hastily.
ISA 28:17 I will make mishpat ·justice· the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place.
ISA 28:18 Your covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol ·Place of the dead· shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it.
ISA 28:19 As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.”
ISA 28:20 For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.
ISA 28:21 For Adonai will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act.
ISA 28:22 Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· a decree of destruction from 'Adonay, Adonai Tzva'ot [Lord, Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], on the whole earth.
ISA 28:23 Give ear, and sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice! Listen, and hear my speech!
ISA 28:24 Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?
ISA 28:25 When he has leveled its surface, does not he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?
ISA 28:26 For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.
ISA 28:27 For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.
ISA 28:28 Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it.
ISA 28:29 This also comes out from Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
ISA 29:1 Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David [Beloved] encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come around;
ISA 29:2 then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.
ISA 29:3 I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you.
ISA 29:4 You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.
ISA 29:5 But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.
ISA 29:6 She will be visited by Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire.
ISA 29:7 The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
ISA 29:8 It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger is not satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] will be like that.
ISA 29:9 Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
ISA 29:10 For Adonai has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered your heads, the seers.
ISA 29:11 All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed:”
ISA 29:12 and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t read.”
ISA 29:13 'Adonay [Lord] said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their ‘fear of me’ is a mitzvah ·instruction· of human origin—
ISA 29:14 therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”
ISA 29:15 Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Adonai, and whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?”
ISA 29:16 You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?”
ISA 29:17 Is not it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?
ISA 29:18 In that day, the deaf will sh'ma ·hear obey· the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
ISA 29:19 The humble also will increase their joy in Adonai, and the poor among men will rejoice in haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 29:20 For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do vain striving of iniquity are cut off—
ISA 29:21 who cause a person to be found in sin ·err (the standard goal)· by a word, and lay a snare for the arbiter in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.
ISA 29:22 Therefore Adonai, who redeemed Abraham [Father of a multitude], says concerning the house of Jacob [Supplanter]: “Jacob [Supplanter] shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale.
ISA 29:23 But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob [Supplanter], and will stand in awe of the God of Israel [God prevails].
ISA 29:24 They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.”
ISA 30:1 “Woe to the rebellious children,” says Adonai, “who take counsel, but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my breath mind Spirit, that they may add habitual sin ·missing the mark· to habitual sin ·missing the mark·,
ISA 30:2 who set out to go down into Egypt [Abode of slavery], and have not asked my advice; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt [Abode of slavery]!
ISA 30:3 Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt [Abode of slavery] your confusion.
ISA 30:4 For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.
ISA 30:5 They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.”
ISA 30:6 The burden of the animals of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people.
ISA 30:7 For Egypt [Abode of slavery] helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I called her Rahab who sits still.
ISA 30:8 Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.
ISA 30:9 For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not sh'ma ·hear obey· Adonai’s Torah ·Teaching·;
ISA 30:10 who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and to the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits.
ISA 30:11 Get out of the way. Turn aside from the path. Cause haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails] to cease from before us.”
ISA 30:12 Therefore thus says haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it;
ISA 30:13 therefore this depravity (moral evil) shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.
ISA 30:14 He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won’t be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.”
ISA 30:15 For thus said 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], “You will be saved in making teshuvah ·complete return· and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused,
ISA 30:16 but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses;” therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the swift;” therefore those who pursue you will be swift.
ISA 30:17 One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.
ISA 30:18 Therefore Adonai will wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have racham ·merciful love· on you, for Adonai is a God of mishpat ·justice·. Blessed are all those who wait for him.
ISA 30:19 For the people will dwell in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] at Jerusalem [City of peace]. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he sh'ma ·hears obeys· you, he will answer you.
ISA 30:20 Though 'Adonay [Lord] may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers won’t be hidden any more, but your eyes will see your teachers;
ISA 30:21 and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will sh'ma ·hear obey· a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.”
ISA 30:22 You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!”
ISA 30:23 He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures.
ISA 30:24 The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
ISA 30:25 There shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
ISA 30:26 Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that Adonai binds up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they were struck with.
ISA 30:27 Behold, Adonai’s name comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire.
ISA 30:28 His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples.
ISA 30:29 You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to Adonai’s mountain, to Israel [God prevails]’s Rock.
ISA 30:30 Adonai will cause his glorious voice to be sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, and will show the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones.
ISA 30:31 For through Adonai’s voice the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike him with his rod.
ISA 30:32 Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Adonai will lay on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.
ISA 30:33 For Tophet (Place of fiery torment for the dead, located in Gehenna), his burning place, has long been ready. Yes, for the king it is prepared. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Adonai’s breath, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
ISA 31:1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt [Abode of slavery] for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they don’t look to haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], and they don’t seek Adonai!
ISA 31:2 Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of those who work vain striving of iniquity.
ISA 31:3 Now the Egyptians [people from Abode of slavery] are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When Adonai stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.
ISA 31:4 For Adonai says to me, “As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for their noise, so Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will come down to fight on Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] and on its heights.
ISA 31:5 As birds hovering, so Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will protect Jerusalem [City of peace]. He will protect and deliver it. He will pass over and preserve it.”
ISA 31:6 Make teshuvah ·complete return· to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel [God prevails].
ISA 31:7 For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold— crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· which your own hands have made for you.
ISA 31:8 “The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him. He will flee from the sword, and his young men will become subject to forced labor.
ISA 31:9 His rock will pass away by reason of terror, and his princes will be afraid of the banner,” says Adonai, whose fire is in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], and his furnace in Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 32:1 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in mishpat ·justice·.
ISA 32:2 A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a cover from the storm, as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.
ISA 32:3 The eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears of those who sh'ma ·hear obey· will listen.
ISA 32:4 The heart of the rash will understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.
ISA 32:5 The fool will no longer be called noble, nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
ISA 32:6 For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work vain striving of iniquity, to practice profanity, and to utter error against Adonai, To make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
ISA 32:7 The ways of the scoundrel are evil. He devises wicked devices to destroy the humble with lying words, even when the needy speaks of mishpat ·just judgement·.
ISA 32:8 But the noble devises noble things; and he will continue in noble things.
ISA 32:9 Rise up, you women who are at ease! Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my voice! You careless daughters, give ear to my speech!
ISA 32:10 For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women; for the vintage shall fail. The harvest won’t come.
ISA 32:11 Tremble, you women who are at ease! Be troubled, you careless ones! Strip yourselves, make yourselves naked, and put sackcloth on your waist.
ISA 32:12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
ISA 32:13 Thorns and briers will come up on my people’s land; yes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
ISA 32:14 For the palace will be forsaken. The populous city will be deserted. The hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever, a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
ISA 32:15 Until the Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· is poured on us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is considered a forest.
ISA 32:16 Then mishpat ·justice· will dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.
ISA 32:17 The work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
ISA 32:18 My people will live in a peaceful habitation, in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting places.
ISA 32:19 Though hail flattens the forest, and the city is leveled completely.
ISA 32:20 Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey.
ISA 33:1 Woe to you who destroy, but you were not destroyed; and who betray, but nobody betrayed you! When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed; and when you have finished betrayal, you will be betrayed.
ISA 33:2 Adonai, be gracious to us. We have waited for you. Be our strength every morning, our yishu'ah ·salvation· also in the time of trouble.
ISA 33:3 At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled. When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.
ISA 33:4 Your plunder will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers. Men will leap on it as locusts leap.
ISA 33:5 Adonai is exalted, for he dwells on high. He has filled Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] with mishpat ·justice· and righteousness.
ISA 33:6 There will be stability in your times, abundance of yishu'ah ·salvation·, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of Adonai is your treasure.
ISA 33:7 Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
ISA 33:8 The highways are desolate. The traveling man ceases. The covenant is broken. He has despised the cities. He does not respect man.
ISA 33:9 The land mourns and languishes. Lebanon is confounded and withers away. Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.
ISA 33:10 “Now I will arise,” says Adonai; “Now I will lift myself up. Now I will be exalted.
ISA 33:11 You will conceive chaff. You will give birth to stubble. Your breath is a fire that will devour you.
ISA 33:12 The peoples will be like the burning of lime, like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire.
ISA 33:13 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might.”
ISA 33:14 The people who sin ·intentionally miss the mark goal· in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who among us can live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with everlasting burning?
ISA 33:15 He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; He who despises the gain of oppressions, who gestures with his hands, refusing to take a bribe, who stops his ears from sh'ma ·hearing obeying· plots of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking at evil—
ISA 33:16 he will dwell on high. His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks. His bread will be supplied. His waters will be sure.
ISA 33:17 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty. They will see a distant land.
ISA 33:18 Your heart will meditate on the terror. Where is he who counted? Where is he who weighed? Where is he who counted the towers?
ISA 33:19 You will no longer see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that you can’t sh'ma ·hear understand obey·, with a strange language that you can’t understand.
ISA 33:20 Look at Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], the city of our appointed festivals. Your eyes will see Jerusalem [City of peace], a quiet habitation, a tent that won’t be removed. Its stakes will never be plucked up, nor will any of its cords be broken.
ISA 33:21 But there Adonai will be with us in majesty, a place of wide rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars will go, neither will any gallant ship pass by there.
ISA 33:22 For Adonai is our judge. Adonai is our Torah-giver. Adonai is our king. He will save us.
ISA 33:23 Your rigging is untied. They couldn’t strengthen the foot of their mast. They couldn’t spread the sail. Then the prey of a great plunder was divided. The lame took the prey.
ISA 33:24 The inhabitant won’t say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their depravity (moral evil).
ISA 34:1 Come near, you nations, to sh'ma ·hear obey·! Listen, you peoples. Let the earth and all it contains sh'ma ·hear obey·; the world, and everything that comes from it.
ISA 34:2 For Adonai is enraged against all the nations, and angry with all their armies. He has utterly destroyed them. He has given them over for slaughter.
ISA 34:3 Their slain will also be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies will come up; and the mountains will melt in their blood.
ISA 34:4 All of the army of the sky will be dissolved. The sky will be rolled up like a scroll, and all its armies will fade away, as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.
ISA 34:5 For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky. Behold, it will come down on Edom [Red], and on the people of my curse, for judgment.
ISA 34:6 Adonai’s sword is filled with blood. It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Adonai has a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom [Red].
ISA 34:7 The wild oxen will come down with them, and the young bulls with the mighty bulls; and their land will be drunken with blood, and their dust made greasy with fat.
ISA 34:8 For Adonai has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
ISA 34:9 Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into sulfur, And its land will become burning pitch.
ISA 34:10 It won’t be quenched night nor day. Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to generation, it will lie waste. No one will pass through it forever and ever.
ISA 34:11 But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it. The owl and the raven will dwell in it. He will stretch the line of confusion over it, and the plumb line of emptiness.
ISA 34:12 They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.
ISA 34:13 Thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it will be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.
ISA 34:14 The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves, and the wild goat will cry to his fellow. Yes, the night creature shall settle there, and shall find herself a place of rest.
ISA 34:15 The arrow snake will make her nest there, and lay, hatch, and gather under her shade. Yes, the kites will be gathered there, every one with her mate.
ISA 34:16 Search in the book of Adonai, and read: not one of these will be missing. None will lack her mate. For my mouth has enjoined, and his Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· has gathered them.
ISA 34:17 He has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line. They shall possess it forever. From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
ISA 35:1 The wilderness and the dry land will be glad. The desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
ISA 35:2 It will blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing. Lebanon’s kavod ·weighty glory· will be given to it, the excellence of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing·, the excellence of our God.
ISA 35:3 Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
ISA 35:4 Tell those who have a fearful heart, “Be strong. Don’t be afraid. Behold, your God will come with vengeance, God’s retribution. He will come and save you.
ISA 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
ISA 35:6 Then the lame man will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing; for waters will break out in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.
ISA 35:7 The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water. Grass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals, where they lay.
ISA 35:8 A highway will be there, a road, and it will be called The Holy Way. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it will be for those who walk in the Way. Wicked fools will not go there.
ISA 35:9 No lion will be there, nor will any ravenous animal go up on it. They will not be found there; but the redeemed will walk there.
ISA 35:10 The Adonai’s ransomed ones will teshuvah ·completely return·, and come with singing to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]; and everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.”
ISA 36:1 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria [Level plain] attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah [Praised], and captured them.
ISA 36:2 The king of Assyria [Level plain] sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem [City of peace] to king Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway.
ISA 36:3 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him.
ISA 36:4 Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria [Level plain], “What confidence is this in which you trust?
ISA 36:5 I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?
ISA 36:6 Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt [Abode of slavery], which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] to all who trust in him.
ISA 36:7 But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God],’ is not that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah [Praised] and to Jerusalem [City of peace], ‘You shall worship before this altar?’”
ISA 36:8 Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria [Level plain], and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
ISA 36:9 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt [Abode of slavery] for chariots and for horsemen?
ISA 36:10 Have I come up now without Adonai against this land to destroy it? Adonai said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.”’”
ISA 36:11 Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic [Elevated], for we sh'ma ·hear understand obey· it; and don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
ISA 36:12 But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”
ISA 36:13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· the words of the great king, the king of Assyria [Level plain]!
ISA 36:14 Thus says the king, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you.
ISA 36:15 Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Adonai, saying, “Adonai will surely deliver us. This city won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria [Level plain].”’
ISA 36:16 Don’t sh'ma ·hear obey· Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria [Level plain], ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;
ISA 36:17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
ISA 36:18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “Adonai will deliver us.” Have any of the deities of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria [Level plain]?
ISA 36:19 Where are the deities of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the deities of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
ISA 36:20 Who are they among all the deities of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Adonai should deliver Jerusalem [City of peace] out of my hand?’”
ISA 36:21 But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s order was, “Don’t answer him.”
ISA 36:22 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
ISA 37:1 When king Hezekiah sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Adonai’s house.
ISA 37:2 He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet, the son of Amoz.
ISA 37:3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to give birth.
ISA 37:4 It may be Adonai your God will sh'ma ·hear obey· the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria [Level plain] his master has sent to defy the Elohim Chayim [Living God], and will rebuke the words which Adonai your God has sh'ma ·heard obeyed·. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”
ISA 37:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah [Salvation of Yah].
ISA 37:6 Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] said to them, “Tell your master, ‘Adonai says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, with which the servants of the king of Assyria [Level plain] have blasphemed me.
ISA 37:7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will sh'ma ·hear obey· news, and will teshuvah ·completely return· to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”
ISA 37:8 So Rabshakeh make teshuvah ·complete return·, and found the king of Assyria [Level plain] warring against Libnah, for he had sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that he was departed from Lachish.
ISA 37:9 He sh'ma ·heard obeyed· news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
ISA 37:10 “Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah [Praised], saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem [City of peace] won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria [Level plain].”
ISA 37:11 Behold, you have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· what the kings of Assyria [Level plain] have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?
ISA 37:12 Have the deities of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran [Mountaineer], Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
ISA 37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’”
ISA 37:14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Adonai’s house, and spread it before Adonai.
ISA 37:15 Hezekiah prayed to Adonai, saying,
ISA 37:16 “Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], the God of Israel [God prevails], who is enthroned among the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
ISA 37:17 Turn your ear, Adonai, and sh'ma ·hear obey·. Open your eyes, Adonai, and behold. Sh'ma ·Hear obey· all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the Elohim Chayim [Living God].
ISA 37:18 Truly, Adonai, the kings of Assyria [Level plain] have destroyed all the countries and their land,
ISA 37:19 and have cast their deities into the fire; for they were no elohim ·deities, judges·, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
ISA 37:20 Now therefore, Yahweh Eloheikhem [Yahweh our God], save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Adonai, even you only.”
ISA 37:21 Then Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, Elohim Isra'el [He sustains breathing, God of God prevails] says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria [Level plain],
ISA 37:22 this is the word which Adonai has spoken concerning him. The virgin daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem [City of peace] has shaken her head at you.
ISA 37:23 Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 37:24 By your servants, have you defied 'Adonay [Lord], and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field.
ISA 37:25 I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt [Abode of slavery].”
ISA 37:26 Have you not sh'ma ·heard obeyed· how I have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them into ruinous heaps.
ISA 37:27 Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like a field before its crop has grown.
ISA 37:28 But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me.
ISA 37:29 Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
ISA 37:30 This shall be the sign to you. You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
ISA 37:31 The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah [Praised] will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
ISA 37:32 For out of Jerusalem [City of peace] a remnant will go out, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. The zeal of Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] will perform this.’
ISA 37:33 Therefore Adonai says concerning the king of Assyria [Level plain], ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
ISA 37:34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall teshuvah ·completely return·, and he shall not come to this city,’ says Adonai.
ISA 37:35 ‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David [Beloved]’s sake.’”
ISA 37:36 Ha mal'ak Yahweh [The Angel of He sustains breathing] went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
ISA 37:37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria [Level plain] departed, went away, teshuvah ·completely returned· to Nineveh [Offspring’s Habitation], and stayed there.
ISA 37:38 As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his deity, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
ISA 38:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick and near death. Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “Adonai says, ‘Enjoin your house, set it in order, for you will die, and not live.’”
ISA 38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Adonai,
ISA 38:3 and said, “Remember now, Adonai, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Hezekiah wept bitterly.
ISA 38:4 Then Adonai’s word came to Isaiah [Salvation of Yah], saying,
ISA 38:5 “Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Adonai says, the God of David [Beloved] your father, “I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
ISA 38:6 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria [Level plain], and I will defend this city.
ISA 38:7 This shall be the sign to you from Adonai, that Adonai will do this thing that he has spoken.
ISA 38:8 Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to make teshuvah ·complete return· backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.”’”
ISA 38:9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah [Praised], when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness.
ISA 38:10 I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol ·Place of the dead·. I am deprived of the residue of my years.”
ISA 38:11 I said, “I won’t see Yah, Yah in the land of the living. I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
ISA 38:12 My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent. I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life. He will cut me off from the loom. From day even to night you will make an end of me.
ISA 38:13 I waited patiently until morning. He breaks all my bones like a lion. From day even to night you will make an end of me.
ISA 38:14 I chattered like a swallow or a crane. I moaned like a dove. My eyes weaken looking upward. Lord, I am oppressed. Be my security.”
ISA 38:15 What will I say? He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it. I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul.
ISA 38:16 Lord, men live by these things; and my spirit finds life in all of them: you restore me, and cause me to live.
ISA 38:17 Behold, for peace I had great anguish, but you have in chasak ·desire, to make bands· for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; for you have cast all my crimes deserving peanlty, sins ·missing the goal· behind your back.
ISA 38:18 For Sheol ·Place of the dead· can’t yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· unto you. Death can’t celebrate you. Those who go down into the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol) can’t hope for your truth.
ISA 38:19 The living, the living, he shall yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, as I do today. The father shall make known your truth to the children.
ISA 38:20 Adonai will save me. Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in Adonai’s house.
ISA 38:21 Now Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.”
ISA 38:22 Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to Adonai’s house?”
ISA 39:1 At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon [Confusion], sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· that he had been sick, and had recovered.
ISA 39:2 Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.
ISA 39:3 Then Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? Where did they come from to you?” Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon [Confusion].”
ISA 39:4 Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”
ISA 39:5 Then Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] said to Hezekiah, “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· the Davar Yahweh Tzva'ot [Word of He sustains breathing Commander of heaven’s armies]:
ISA 39:6 ‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon [Confusion]. Nothing will be left,’ says Adonai.
ISA 39:7 ‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon [Confusion]’s palace.’”
ISA 39:8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah [Salvation of Yah], “Adonai’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”
ISA 40:1 “Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God.
ISA 40:2 “Speak comfortably to Jerusalem [City of peace]; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her depravity (moral evil) is pardoned, that she has received of Adonai’s hand double for all her habitual sins ·missing the marks·.”
ISA 40:3 The voice of one who calls out, “Prepare the way of Adonai in the wilderness! Make a level highway in the desert for our God.
ISA 40:4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain.
ISA 40:5 Adonai ’s kavod ·weighty glory· shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Adonai has spoken it.”
ISA 40:6 The voice of one saying, “Cry!” One said, “What shall I cry?” “All flesh is like grass, and all its chesed ·loving-kindness· is like the flower of the field.
ISA 40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades, because Adonai’s breath blows on it. Surely the people are like grass.
ISA 40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God stands forever.”
ISA 40:9 You who tell good news to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], go up on a high mountain. You who tell good news to Jerusalem [City of peace], lift up your voice with strength. Lift it up. Don’t be afraid. Say to the cities of Judah [Praised], “Behold, your God!”
ISA 40:10 Behold, 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
ISA 40:11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd. He will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom. He will gently lead those who have their young.
ISA 40:12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and marked off the sky with his span [9 in; 22.86 cm], and calculated the dust of the earth in a measuring basket, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
ISA 40:13 Who has directed Ruach Yahweh [Spirit, Breath of He sustains breathing] or has taught him as his counselor?
ISA 40:14 Who did he take counsel with, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of mishpat ·justice·, and taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding?
ISA 40:15 Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance. Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing.
ISA 40:16 Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering.
ISA 40:17 All the nations are like nothing before him. They are regarded by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
ISA 40:18 To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare to him?
ISA 40:19 A workman has cast an image, and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts silver chains for it.
ISA 40:20 He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot. He seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved.
ISA 40:21 Haven’t you known? Haven’t you sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, yet? Haven’t you been told from the beginning? Haven’t you understood from the foundations of the earth?
ISA 40:22 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;
ISA 40:23 who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the earth like meaningless.
ISA 40:24 They are planted scarcely. They are sown scarcely. Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground. He merely blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.
ISA 40:25 “To whom then will you liken me? Who is my equal?” says the Holy One.
ISA 40:26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their army by number. He calls them all by name. By the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power, Not one is lacking.
ISA 40:27 Why do you say, Jacob [Supplanter], and speak, Israel [God prevails], “My way is hidden from Adonai, and the mishpat ·justice· due to me is passed over by my God?”
ISA 40:28 Haven’t you known? Haven’t you sh'ma ·heard obeyed·? The everlasting God, Adonai, The Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint. He is not weary. His understanding is unsearchable.
ISA 40:29 He gives power to the weak. He increases the strength of him who has no might.
ISA 40:30 Even the youths faint and get weary, and the young men utterly fall;
ISA 40:31 But those who wait for Adonai will renew their strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run, and not be weary. They will walk, and not faint.
ISA 41:1 “Keep silent before me, islands, and let the peoples renew their strength. Let them come near, then let them speak. Let’s meet together for judgment.
ISA 41:2 Who has raised up one from the east? Who called him to his foot in righteousness? He hands over nations to him, and makes him rule over kings. He gives them like the dust to his sword, like the driven stubble to his bow.
ISA 41:3 He pursues them, and passes by safely, Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.
ISA 41:4 Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Adonai, am the first א (Aleph), and I am the same with those are the last ת (Tav), I am he.”
ISA 41:5 The islands have seen, and fear. The ends of the earth tremble. They approach, and come.
ISA 41:6 Everyone helps his neighbor. They say to their brothers, “Be strong!”
ISA 41:7 So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith. He who smooths with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, “It is good;” and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter.
ISA 41:8 “But you, Israel [God prevails], my servant, Jacob [Supplanter] whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham [Father of a multitude] my 'ahav ·affectionate lover, friend·,
ISA 41:9 You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from its corners, and said to you, ‘You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you away;’
ISA 41:10 Don’t you be afraid, for I am with you. Don’t be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you. Yes, I will help you. Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.
ISA 41:11 Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded. Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish.
ISA 41:12 You will seek them, and won’t find them, even those who contend with you. Those who war against you will be as nothing, as a non-existent thing.
ISA 41:13 For I, Adonai your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Don’t be afraid. I will help you.’
ISA 41:14 Don’t be afraid, you worm Jacob [Supplanter], and you men of Israel [God prevails]. I will help you,” says Adonai, “and your Redeemer is haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 41:15 Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth. You will thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and will make the hills like chaff.
ISA 41:16 You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, and the whirlwind will scatter them. You will rejoice in Adonai. You will glory in haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 41:17 The poor and needy seek water, and there is none. Their tongue fails for thirst. I, Adonai, will answer them. I, the God of Israel [God prevails], will not forsake them.
ISA 41:18 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and springs in the middle of the valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
ISA 41:19 I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness. I will set cypress trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;
ISA 41:20 that they may see, know, consider, and understand together, that Adonai’s hand has done this, and haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails] has created it.
ISA 41:21 Produce your cause,” says Adonai. “Bring out your strong reasons,” says the King of Jacob [Supplanter].
ISA 41:22 “Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen. Declare the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or sh'ma ·hear obey· unto us things to come.
ISA 41:23 Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are deities. Yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and see it together.
ISA 41:24 Behold, you are of nothing, and your work is of nothing. He who chooses you is an abomination.
ISA 41:25 “I have raised up one from the north, and he has come; from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name; and he shall come on rulers as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
ISA 41:26 Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know? And before, that we may say, ‘He is right?’ Surely, there is no one who declares. Surely, there is no one who sh'ma ·hears obeys, declares·. Surely, there is no one who sh'ma ·hears obeys· your words.
ISA 41:27 I am the first to say to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], ‘Behold, look at them;’ and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 41:28 When I look, there is no man; even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
ISA 41:29 Behold, all of them, their deeds are vain striving of iniquity and nothing. Their molten images are wind and confusion.
ISA 42:1 “Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delights— I have put my Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· on him. He will bring mishpat ·justice· to the nations.
ISA 42:2 He will not shout, nor raise his voice, nor cause it to be sh'ma ·heard· in the street.
ISA 42:3 He won’t break a bruised reed. He won’t quench a dimly burning wick. He will faithfully bring mishpat ·justice·.
ISA 42:4 He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he has set mishpat ·justice· in the earth, and the islands will wait for his torot ·teachings·.”
ISA 42:5 Thus says Elohim Yahweh [God He sustains breathing], he who created the heavens and stretched them out, he who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it, he who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it.
ISA 42:6 “I, Adonai , have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and make you a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· for the people, as a light for the nations;
ISA 42:7 to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
ISA 42:8 “I am Yahweh [He sustains breathing]. That is my name. I will not give my kavod ·weighty glory· to another, nor my tehilah ·praise song· to engraved images.
ISA 42:9 Behold, the former things have happened, and I declare new things. I sh'ma ·hear obey, declare· to you about them before they come up.”
ISA 42:10 Sing to Adonai a new song, and his tehilah ·praise song· from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the islands and their inhabitants.
ISA 42:11 Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices, with the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing. Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
ISA 42:12 Let them give kavod ·weighty glory· to Adonai, and declare his tehilah ·praise song· in the islands.
ISA 42:13 Adonai will go out like a mighty man. He will stir up zeal like a man of war. He will raise a war cry. Yes, he will shout aloud. He will triumph over his enemies.
ISA 42:14 “I have been silent a long time. I have been quiet and restrained myself. Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will both gasp and pant.
ISA 42:15 I will destroy mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs. I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
ISA 42:16 I will bring the blind by a way that they don’t know. I will lead them in paths that they don’t know. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. I will do these things, and I will not forsake them.
ISA 42:17 “Those who trust in engraved images, who tell molten images, ‘You are our deities’ will be turned back. They will be utterly disappointed.
ISA 42:18 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see.
ISA 42:19 Who is blind, but my servant? Or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send? Who is as blind as he who is at peace, and as blind as Adonai’s servant?
ISA 42:20 You see many things, but don’t observe. His ears are open, but he does not sh'ma ·hear obey·.
ISA 42:21 It pleased Adonai , for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Torah ·Teaching·, and make it honorable.
ISA 42:22 But this is a robbed and plundered people. All of them are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prisons. They have become captives, and no one delivers; and a plunder, and no one says, ‘Restore them!’
ISA 42:23 Who is there among you who will give ear to this? Who will listen and sh'ma ·hear obey· for the time to come?
ISA 42:24 Who gave Jacob [Supplanter] as plunder, and Israel [God prevails] to the robbers? Didn’t Adonai, he against whom we have sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·? For they would not walk in his ways, and they did not sh'ma ·hear obey· his Torah ·Teaching·.
ISA 42:25 Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire all around, but he didn’t know; and it burned him, but he didn’t take it to heart.”
ISA 43:1 But now Adonai who created you, Jacob [Supplanter], and he who formed you, Israel [God prevails] says: “Don’t be afraid, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by your name. You are mine.
ISA 43:2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, and flame will not scorch you.
ISA 43:3 For I am Adonai your God, haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], the One who saves you. I have given Egypt [Abode of slavery] as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in your place.
ISA 43:4 Since you have been precious and honored in my sight, and I have 'ahav ·affectionately loved· you; therefore I will give people in your place, and nations instead of your life.
ISA 43:5 Don’t be afraid; for I am with you. I will bring your offspring from the east, and gather you from the west.
ISA 43:6 I will tell the north, ‘Give them up!’ and tell the south, ‘Don’t hold them back! Bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth—
ISA 43:7 everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created for my kavod ·weighty glory·, whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made.’”
ISA 43:8 Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.
ISA 43:9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled. Who among them can declare this, and sh'ma ·hear obey, declare· us former things? Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them sh'ma ·hear obey·, and say, “That is true.”
ISA 43:10 “You are my witnesses,” says Adonai, “With my servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and trust me, and understand that I am he. Before me there was no deity formed, neither will there be after me.
ISA 43:11 I myself am Adonai ; and besides me there is no one providing salvation.
ISA 43:12 I have declared, I have saved, and I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed·; and there was no strange deity among you. Therefore you are my witnesses,” says Adonai, “and I am God.
ISA 43:13 Yes, since the day was I am he; and there is no one who can deliver out of my hand. I will work, and who can hinder it?”
ISA 43:14 Adonai, your Redeemer, haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails] says: “For your sake, I have sent to Babylon [Confusion], and I will bring all of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans [Descendants of Loving-kindness], in the ships of their rejoicing.
ISA 43:15 I am Adonai, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel [God prevails], your King.”
ISA 43:16 Adonai, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters says:
ISA 43:17 who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched like a wick):
ISA 43:18 “Don’t remember the former things, and don’t consider the things of old.
ISA 43:19 Behold, I will do a new thing. It springs out now. Don’t you know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
ISA 43:20 The animals of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
ISA 43:21 the people which I formed for myself, that they might declare my tehilah ·praise song·.
ISA 43:22 Yet you have not called on me, Jacob [Supplanter]; but you have been weary of me, Israel [God prevails].
ISA 43:23 You have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied you with frankincense.
ISA 43:24 You have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have abad ·served· me with your habitual sins ·missing the marks·. You have wearied me with your depravities (moral evils).
ISA 43:25 I, even I, am he who blots out your rebellious breaches of relationships for my own sake; and I will not remember your habitual sins ·missing the marks·.
ISA 43:26 Put me in remembrance. Let us plead together. Declare your case, that you may be justified.
ISA 43:27 Your first father sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·, and your teachers have rebelled to break away from authority thus breaking relationship against me.
ISA 43:28 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob [Supplanter] a curse, and Israel [God prevails] an insult.”
ISA 44:1 Yet sh'ma ·hear obey· now, Jacob [Supplanter] my servant, and Israel [God prevails], whom I have chosen.
ISA 44:2 This is what Adonai who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you says: “Don’t be afraid, Jacob [Supplanter] my servant; and you, Jeshurun [Upright one], whom I have chosen.
ISA 44:3 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams on the dry ground. I will pour my Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· on your descendants, and my blessing on your offspring:
ISA 44:4 and they will spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
ISA 44:5 One will say, ‘I am Adonai’s;’ and another will be called by the name of Jacob [Supplanter]; and another will write with his hand ‘to Adonai,’ and honor the name of Israel [God prevails].”
ISA 44:6 This is what Adonai, the King of Israel [God prevails], and his Redeemer, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies], says: “I am the first א (Aleph) Α (Alpha), and I am the last ת (Tav) Ω (Omega); and besides me there are no elohim ·gods, judges·.
ISA 44:7 Who is like me? Who will call, and will declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? Let them declare the things that are coming, and that will happen.
ISA 44:8 Don’t fear, neither be afraid. Haven’t I sh'ma ·heard obeyed, declared· it to you long ago, and shown it? You are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Indeed, there is not. I don’t know any other Rock.”
ISA 44:9 Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain. The things that they delight in will not profit. Their own witnesses don’t see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.
ISA 44:10 Who has fashioned a deity, or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?
ISA 44:11 Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed; and the workmen are mere men. Let them all be gathered together. Let them stand up. They will fear. They will be put to shame together.
ISA 44:12 The blacksmith takes an ax, works in the coals, fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. He is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.
ISA 44:13 The carpenter stretches out a line. He marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes. He marks it out with compasses, and shapes it like the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to reside in a house.
ISA 44:14 He cuts down cedars for himself, and takes the cypress and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest. He plants a cypress tree, and the rain nourishes it.
ISA 44:15 Then it will be for a man to burn; and he takes some of it, and warms himself. Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread. Yes, he makes a deity, and worships it; he makes it an engraved image, and falls down to it.
ISA 44:16 He burns part of it in the fire. With part of it, he eats meat. He roasts a roast, and is satisfied. Yes, he warms himself, and says, “Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.”
ISA 44:17 The rest of it he makes into a deity, even his engraved image. He bows down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, “Deliver me; for you are my deity!”
ISA 44:18 They don’t know, neither do they consider: for he has shut their eyes, that they can’t see; and their hearts, that they can’t understand.
ISA 44:19 No one thinks, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, “I have burned part of it in the fire. Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals. I have roasted meat and eaten it. Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?”
ISA 44:20 He feeds on ashes. A deceived heart has turned him aside; and he can’t deliver his soul, nor say, “Is not there a lie in my right hand?”
ISA 44:21 Remember these things, Jacob [Supplanter] and Israel [God prevails]; for you are my servant. I have formed you. You are my servant. Israel [God prevails], you will not be forgotten by me.
ISA 44:22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your rebellious breaches of relationships, and, as a cloud, your habitual sins ·missing the marks·. Teshuvah ·Completely return· to me, for I have redeemed you.
ISA 44:23 Sing, you heavens, for Adonai has done it! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees, for Adonai has redeemed Jacob [Supplanter], and will glorify himself in Israel [God prevails].
ISA 44:24 Adonai, your Redeemer, and he who formed you from the womb says: “I am Adonai, who makes all things; who alone stretches out the heavens; who spreads out the earth by myself;
ISA 44:25 who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;
ISA 44:26 who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers; who says of Jerusalem [City of peace], ‘She will be inhabited;’ and of the cities of Judah [Praised], ‘They will be built,’ and ‘I will raise up its waste places;’
ISA 44:27 who says to the deep, ‘Be dry,’ and ‘I will dry up your rivers;’
ISA 44:28 Who says of Cyrus [Sun], ‘He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,’ even saying of Jerusalem [City of peace], ‘She will be built;’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’”
ISA 45:1 Adonai says to his anointed, to Cyrus [Sun], whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him, and strip kings of their armor; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut:
ISA 45:2 “I will go before you, and make the rough places smooth. I will break the doors of bronze in pieces, and cut apart the bars of iron.
ISA 45:3 I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that it is I, Adonai, who call you by your name, even the God of Israel [God prevails].
ISA 45:4 For Jacob [Supplanter] my servant’s sake, and Israel [God prevails] my chosen, I have called you by your name. I have given you a title, though you have not known me.
ISA 45:5 I am Yahweh [He sustains breathing], and there is no one else. Besides me, there are no elohim ·gods, judges·. I will strengthen you, though you have not known me;
ISA 45:6 that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is no one besides me. I am Yahweh [He sustains breathing], and there is no one else.
ISA 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness. I make peace, and create calamity. I am Adonai, who does all these things.
ISA 45:8 Rain, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, that it may produce yesha' ·salvation·, and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it. I, Adonai, have created it.
ISA 45:9 Woe to him who strives with his Maker— a clay pot among the clay pots of the earth! Shall the clay ask him who fashions it, ‘What are you making?’ or your work, ‘He has no hands?’
ISA 45:10 Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What have you become the father of?’ or to a mother, ‘To what have you given birth?’”
ISA 45:11 Adonai, haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], and his Maker says: “You ask me about the things that are to come, concerning my sons, and you enjoin me concerning the work of my hands!
ISA 45:12 I have made the earth, and created man on it. I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens; and I have enjoined all their army.
ISA 45:13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways. He shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward,” says Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies].
ISA 45:14 Yahweh [He sustains breathing] says: “The labor of Egypt [Abode of slavery], and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to you, and they shall be yours. They will go after you. They shall come over in chains; and they will bow down to you. They will make supplication to you: ‘Surely God is in you; and there is no one else. There is no other Elohim ·Deity, Judge·.
ISA 45:15 Most certainly you are a God who hidden yourself, God of Israel [God prevails], the One who saves.’”
ISA 45:16 They will be disappointed, yes, confounded, all of them. Those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together.
ISA 45:17 Israel [God prevails] will be saved by Adonai with an everlasting salvation. You will not be disappointed nor confounded to ages everlasting.
ISA 45:18 For Adonai who created the heavens, the God who formed the earth and made it, who established it and didn’t create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited says: “I am Yahweh [He sustains breathing]; and there is no other.
ISA 45:19 I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness. I didn’t say to the offspring of Jacob [Supplanter], ‘Seek me in vain.’ I, Adonai, speak righteousness. I declare things that are right.
ISA 45:20 “Assemble yourselves and come. Draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations. Those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image, and pray to a deity that can’t save.
ISA 45:21 Declare and present it. Yes, let them take counsel together. Who has sh'ma ·heard obeyed, declared· this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Haven’t I, Yahweh [He sustains breathing]? There is no other Elohim ·Deity, Judge· besides me, a just God and able to save; There is no one besides me.
ISA 45:22 “Look to me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.
ISA 45:23 I have sworn by myself. The word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and will not be revoked, that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear
ISA 45:24 about me, ‘There is righteousness and strength only in Adonai.’” Even to him shall men come; and all those who raged against him shall be disappointed.
ISA 45:25 All the offspring of Israel [God prevails] will be justified in Adonai, and will rejoice!
ISA 46:1 Bel bows down. Nebo stoops. Their idols are carried by animals, and on the livestock. The things that you carried around are heavy loads, a burden for the weary.
ISA 46:2 They stoop and they bow down together. They could not deliver the burden, but they have gone into captivity.
ISA 46:3 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· me, house of Jacob [Supplanter], and all the remnant of the house of Israel [God prevails], that have been carried from their birth, that have been carried from the rachamim ·wombs / bowels of compassions·.
ISA 46:4 Even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear. Yes, I will carry, and will deliver.
ISA 46:5 “To whom will you liken me, and consider my equal, and compare me, that we may be equal?
ISA 46:6 Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a deity. They fall down— yes, they worship.
ISA 46:7 They bear it on their shoulder. They carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands there. It cannot move from its place. Yes, one may cry to it, yet it cannot answer. It cannot save him out of his trouble.
ISA 46:8 “Remember this, and show yourselves men. Bring it to mind again, you rebellious who break away from authority thus breaking relationship.
ISA 46:9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is no other. I am God, and there is none like me.
ISA 46:10 I declare the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done. I say: My counsel will stand, and I will do all that I please.
ISA 46:11 I call a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. Yes, I have spoken. I will also bring it to pass. I have planned. I will also do it.
ISA 46:12 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness!
ISA 46:13 I bring my righteousness near. It is not far off, and my salvation will not wait. I will grant salvation to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], my glory to Israel [God prevails].
ISA 47:1 “Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon [Confusion]. Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans [Descendants of Loving-kindness]. For you will no longer be called tender and delicate.
ISA 47:2 Take the millstones, and grind flour. Remove your veil, lift up your skirt, uncover your legs, and wade through the rivers.
ISA 47:3 Your nakedness will be uncovered. Yes, your shame will be seen. I will take vengeance, and will spare no one.”
ISA 47:4 Our Redeemer, Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is his name, is haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 47:5 “Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans [Descendants of Loving-kindness]. For you shall no longer be called the mistress of kingdoms.
ISA 47:6 I was angry with my people. I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand. You showed them no rachamim ·merciful loves·. You laid a very heavy yoke on the aged.
ISA 47:7 You said, ‘I will be a princess forever;’ so that you did not lay these things to your heart, nor did you remember the results.
ISA 47:8 “Now therefore sh'ma ·hear obey· this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me. I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children.’
ISA 47:9 But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children and widowhood. They will come on you in their full measure, in the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments.
ISA 47:10 For you have trusted in your wickedness. You have said, ‘No one sees me.’ Your wisdom and your knowledge has perverted you. You have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.’
ISA 47:11 Therefore disaster will come on you. You won’t know when it dawns. Mischief will fall on you. You won’t be able to put it away. Desolation will come on you suddenly, which you don’t understand.
ISA 47:12 “Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; as if you might profit; as if you might prevail.
ISA 47:13 You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels. Now let the astrologers, the stargazers, and the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save you from the things that will come on you.
ISA 47:14 Behold, they shall are like stubble. The fire will burn them. They won’t deliver themselves from the power of the flame. It won’t be a coal to warm at or a fire to sit by.
ISA 47:15 The things that you labored in will be like this: those who have trafficked with you from your youth will each wander in his own way. There will be no one to save you.
ISA 48:1 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· this, house of Jacob [Supplanter], you who are called by the name of Israel [God prevails], and have come out of the waters of Judah [Praised]. You swear by Adonai’s name, and make mention of the God of Israel [God prevails], but not in truth, nor in righteousness
ISA 48:2 (for they call themselves citizens of the holy city, and rely on the God of Israel [God prevails]; Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is his name):
ISA 48:3 I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went out of my mouth, and I sh'ma ·heard obeyed, declared· them. I did them suddenly, and they happened.
ISA 48:4 Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow bronze;
ISA 48:5 therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it came to pass I sh'ma ·heard obeyed, declared· it to you; lest you should say, ‘My idol has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten image, has enjoined them.’
ISA 48:6 You have sh'ma ·hear obey· it; see all this. And you, won’t you declare it? “I have sh'ma ·hear obey, declared· you new things from this time, even hidden things, which you have not known.
ISA 48:7 They are created now, and not from of old; and before today you didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· them; lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’
ISA 48:8 Yes, you didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey·; yes, you didn’t know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened: for I knew that you dealt very treacherously, and were called rebellious who break away from authority thus breaking relationshipfrom the womb.
ISA 48:9 For my name’s sake, I will defer my anger, and for my tehilah ·praise song· I hold it back for you, so that I don’t cut you off.
ISA 48:10 Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver. I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.
ISA 48:11 For my own sake, for my own sake, I will do it; for how would my name be profaned? I will not give my kavod ·weighty glory· to another.
ISA 48:12 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· me, O Jacob [Supplanter], and Israel [God prevails] my called: I am he; I am the first א (Aleph) Α (Alpha), I am also the last ת (Tav) Ω (Omega).
ISA 48:13 Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens. When I call to them, they stand up together.
ISA 48:14 “Assemble yourselves, all of you, and sh'ma ·hear obey·; who among them has declared these things? He whom Adonai 'ahav ·affectionately loves· will do what he likes to Babylon [Confusion], and his arm will be against the Chaldeans [Descendants of Loving-kindness].
ISA 48:15 I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him. I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
ISA 48:16 “Come near to me and sh'ma ·hear obey· this: “From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it happened, I was there.” Now 'Adonay Yahweh [Lord He sustains breathing] has sent me, with his Ruach ·Spirit, Breath·.
ISA 48:17 Adonai, your Redeemer, haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails] says: “I am Adonai your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.
ISA 48:18 Oh that you had listened to my mitzvot ·instructions·! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
ISA 48:19 Your offspring also would have been as the sand, and the descendants of your body like its grains. His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.”
ISA 48:20 Leave Babylon [Confusion]! Flee from the Chaldeans [Descendants of Loving-kindness]! With a voice of singing sh'ma ·hear obey, declare· this, tell it even to the end of the earth: say, “Adonai has redeemed his servant Jacob [Supplanter]!”
ISA 48:21 They didn’t thirst when he led them through the deserts. He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them. He split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
ISA 48:22 “There is no peace,” says Adonai, “for the wicked.”
ISA 49:1 Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, islands, to me. Listen, you peoples, from afar: Adonai has called me from the womb; from the inside of my mother he has mentioned my name.
ISA 49:2 He has made my mouth like a sharp sword. He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand. He has made me a polished shaft. He has kept me close in his quiver.
ISA 49:3 He said to me, “You are my servant; Israel [God prevails], in whom I will be glorified.”
ISA 49:4 But I said, “I have labored in vain. I have spent my strength in vain for nothing; yet surely the mishpat ·justice· due to me is with Adonai, and my reward with my God.”
ISA 49:5 Now Adonai says, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob [Supplanter] again to him, and to gather Israel [God prevails] to him, for I am honorable in Adonai’s eyes, and my God has become my strength.
ISA 49:6 Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob [Supplanter], and to restore the preserved of Israel [God prevails]? I will also give you as a light to the nations, that you may be my yishu'ah ·salvation·to the end of the earth.”
ISA 49:7 Adonai , the Go'eil Isra'el [Redeemer of God prevails], and his Holy One, says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers: “Kings shall see and rise up; princes, and they shall hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship; because of Adonai who is faithful, even haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], who has chosen you.”
ISA 49:8 Adonai says, “In an acceptable time I have answered you, and in a day of yishu'ah ·salvation· I have helped you. I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage:
ISA 49:9 saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’; to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’ “They shall feed along the paths, and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.
ISA 49:10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he who has racham ·merciful love· towards them will lead them. He will guide them by springs of water.
ISA 49:11 I will make all my mountains a road, and my highways shall be exalted.
ISA 49:12 Behold, these shall come from afar; and behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.”
ISA 49:13 Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break out into singing, mountains: for Adonai has comforted his people, and will have racham ·compassionate love· on his afflicted.
ISA 49:14 But Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] said, “Adonai has forsaken me, and 'Adonay [Lord] has forgotten me.”
ISA 49:15 “Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have racham ·compassionate love· on the son of her womb? Yes, these may forget, yet I will not forget you!
ISA 49:16 Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands. Your walls are continually before me.
ISA 49:17 Your children hurry. Your destroyers and those who devastated you will leave you.
ISA 49:18 Lift up your eyes all around, and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live,” says Adonai, “you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and dress yourself with them, like a bride.
ISA 49:19 “For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now that land will be too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
ISA 49:20 The children of your bereavement will say in your ears, ‘This place is too small for me. Give me a place to live in.’
ISA 49:21 Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? Who has brought these up? Behold, I was left alone. Where were these?’”
ISA 49:22 Thus says 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and lift up my banner to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
ISA 49:23 Kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; Then you will know that I am Adonai; and those who wait for me shall not be disappointed.”
ISA 49:24 Shall the plunder be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?
ISA 49:25 But Adonai says, “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the plunder retrieved from the fierce; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.
ISA 49:26 I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine. Then all flesh shall know that I, Adonai, am the One who saves you, and your Redeemer, the 'Avir Ya'akov [Mighty One of Supplanter].”
ISA 50:1 Adonai says, “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, with which I have put her away? or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Behold, you were sold for your depravities (moral evils), and your mother was put away for your rebellious breaches of relationships.
ISA 50:2 Why, when I came, was there no one? when I called, why was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.
ISA 50:3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.”
ISA 50:4 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary. He wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to sh'ma ·hear obey· as those who are taught.
ISA 50:5 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious. I have not turned back.
ISA 50:6 I gave my back to those who beat me, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. I didn’t hide my face from insult and spitting.
ISA 50:7 For 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] will help me. Therefore I have not been confounded. Therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be disappointed.
ISA 50:8 He who declares me righteous me is near. Who will bring charges against me? Let us stand up together. Who is my mishpat · adversary·? Let him come near to me.
ISA 50:9 Behold, 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] will help me! Who is he who will condemn me as guilty? Behold, they will all grow old like a garment. The moths will eat them up.
ISA 50:10 Who among you fears Adonai , and sh'ma ·hears obeys· the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in Adonai ’s name, and rely on his God.
ISA 50:11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves; walk in the flame of your fire, and among the torches that you have kindled. You will have this from my hand: You will lie down in sorrow.
ISA 51:1 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· to me, you who follow after righteousness, you who seek Adonai: look to the rock you were cut from, and to the quarry you were dug from.
ISA 51:2 Look to Abraham [Father of a multitude] your father, and to Sarah [Princess] who bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.
ISA 51:3 For Adonai has comforted Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. He has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden [Delight], and her desert like the garden of Adonai. Joy and gladness will be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
ISA 51:4 “Listen to me, my people; and hear me, my nation: for the Torah ·Teaching· will go out from me, and I will establish my mishpat ·justice· for a light to the peoples.
ISA 51:5 My righteousness is near. My yesha' ·salvation· has gone out, and my arms will judge the peoples. The islands will wait for me, and they will trust my arm.
ISA 51:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens will vanish away like smoke, and the earth will wear out like a garment; and its inhabitants will die in the same way: but my yishu'ah ·salvation· will be forever, and my righteousness will not be abolished.
ISA 51:7 “Sh'ma ·Hear obey· to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my Torah ·Teaching·: Don’t fear the reproach of men, and don’t be dismayed at their insults.
ISA 51:8 For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool; but my righteousness will be forever, and my yishu'ah ·salvation· to all generations.”
ISA 51:9 Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Adonai! Awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Is not it you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the monster?
ISA 51:10 Is not it you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
ISA 51:11 Those ransomed by Adonai will teshuvah ·completely return·, and come with singing to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy. Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
ISA 51:12 “I, even I, am he who comforts you. Who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who will be made as grass?
ISA 51:13 Have you forgotten Yahweh 'Oseinu [Yahweh our Maker], who stretched out the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth? Do you live in fear continually all day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he prepares to destroy? Where is the fury of the oppressor?
ISA 51:14 The captive exile will speedily be freed; and he will not die and go down into the pit, and his bread will not fail.
ISA 51:15 For I am Adonai your God, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar: Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is his name.
ISA 51:16 3I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], ‘You are my people.’”
ISA 51:17 Awake, awake! Stand up, Jerusalem [City of peace], you who have drunk from Adonai ’s hand the cup of his wrath. You have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.
ISA 51:18 There is no one to guide her among all the sons to whom she has given birth; and there is no one who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.
ISA 51:19 These two things have happened to you— who will grieve with you?— desolation and destruction, and famine and the sword. How can I comfort you?
ISA 51:20 Your sons have fainted. They lie at the head of all the streets, like an antelope in a net. They are full of the wrath of Adonai, the rebuke of your God.
ISA 51:21 Therefore now sh'ma ·hear obey· this, you afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
ISA 51:22 Thus says 'adonayik Adonai [your Lord Yahweh], your God who pleads the cause of his people, “Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath. You will not drink it any more:
ISA 51:23 and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, ‘Bow down, that we may walk over you;’ and you have laid your back as the ground, like a street to those who walk over.”
ISA 52:1 Awake, awake! Put on your strength, Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. Put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem [City of peace], the holy city: for from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean will no more come into you.
ISA 52:2 Shake yourself from the dust! Arise, sit up, Jerusalem [City of peace]! Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]!
ISA 52:3 For Adonai says, “You were sold for nothing; and you will be redeemed without money.”
ISA 52:4 For thus says 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh]: “My people went down at the first into Egypt [Abode of slavery] to live there: and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.
ISA 52:5 “Now therefore, what do I do here,” says Adonai, “seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them mock,” says Adonai, “and my name is blasphemed continually all the day.
ISA 52:6 Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks. Behold, it is I.”
ISA 52:7 How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who sh'ma ·hear obey, declares· peace, who brings good news, who sh'ma ·hear obey, proclaims· yishu'ah ·salvation·, who says to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], “Your God reigns!”
ISA 52:8 Your watchmen lift up their voice, together they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when Adonai makes teshuvah ·complete return· to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking].
ISA 52:9 Break out into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem [City of peace]; for Adonai has comforted his people. He has redeemed Jerusalem [City of peace].
ISA 52:10 Adonai has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the את yishu'ah ·salvation· of our God.
ISA 52:11 Depart, depart, go out from there; touch no unclean thing! Go out from among her! Cleanse yourselves, you who carry Adonai’s temple equipment.
ISA 52:12 For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight: for Adonai will go before you; and the God of Israel [God prevails] will be your rear guard.
ISA 52:13 Behold, my servant will deal wisely. He will be exalted and lifted up, and will be very high.
ISA 52:14 Just as many were astonished at you (his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),
ISA 52:15 so he will cleanse many nations. Kings will shut their mouths at him: for they will see that which had not been told them; and that which they did not sh'ma ·hear obey· they will consider and understand.
ISA 53:1 Who has trusted our message? To whom has the arm of Adonai been revealed?
ISA 53:2 For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He has no good looks or majesty. When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
ISA 53:3 He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of suffering, and acquainted with disease. He was despised as one from whom men hide their face; and we didn’t respect him.
ISA 53:4 Surely he has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering; yet we considered him plagued, struck by God, and afflicted.
ISA 53:5 But he was pierced for our rebellious breaches of relationships. He was crushed for our depravities (moral evils). The punishment that brought our peace was on him; and by his stripes and wounds we are healed and made whole.
ISA 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray. Everyone has turned to his own way; and Adonai has laid on him את the depravity (moral evil) of us all.
ISA 53:7 He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth. As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he didn’t open his mouth.
ISA 53:8 After forcible arrest and sentencing, he was taken away; את and none of his generation protested his being cut off out of the land of the living for the rebellious breach of relationship of my people, who deserved the punishment themselves.
ISA 53:9 They made his grave with את the wicked, את and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.
ISA 53:10 Yet it pleased Adonai to bruise him. He has caused him to suffer. To see if he would present himself as a fault incurring guilt offering. If he does, he will see his offspring, and he will prolong his days, and Adonai ’s pleasure will prosper in his hand.
ISA 53:11 After this ordeal, he will see satisfaction “By his knowing [pain and sacrifice]. My righteous servant will justify many; for it is their depravities (moral evils) that he suffers.
ISA 53:12 Therefore will I give him a portion with the great, את and with the strong he will divide the spoils; because he exposed himself to death, and was counted with את the rebellious who break away from authority thus breaking relationship; while actually bearing the crime deserving peanlty, sin ·missing the goal· of many, and interceding for the rebellious who break away from authority thus breaking relationship.
ISA 54:1 “Sing, barren, you who didn’t give birth; break out into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child: for the deserted wife will have more children than the children of the married wife,” says Adonai.
ISA 54:2 “Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations; don’t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.
ISA 54:3 For you will spread out on the right hand and on the left; and your offspring will possess the nations, and settle in desolate cities.
ISA 54:4 “Don’t be afraid; for you will not be ashamed. Don’t be confounded; for you will not be disappointed. For you will forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more.
ISA 54:5 For your Maker is your husband; Adonai Tzva'ot [Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies] is his name. The haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails] is your Redeemer. He will be called the God of the whole earth.
ISA 54:6 For Adonai has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,” says your God.
ISA 54:7 “For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great rachamim ·merciful loves· will I gather you.
ISA 54:8 In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting chesed ·loving-kindness· I will have racham ·merciful love· on you,” says Adonai your Redeemer.
ISA 54:9 “For this is like the waters of Noah [Rest] to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah [Rest] will no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.
ISA 54:10 For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my chesed ·loving-kindness· will not depart from you, and my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of peace will not be removed,” says Adonai who has mercy on you.
ISA 54:11 “You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
ISA 54:12 I will make your pinnacles of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
ISA 54:13 All your children will be taught by Adonai; and your children’s peace will be great.
ISA 54:14 In righteousness you will be established. You will be far from oppression, for you will not be afraid; and far from terror, for it shall not come near you.
ISA 54:15 Behold, they may gather together, but not by me. Whoever gathers together against you will fall because of you.
ISA 54:16 “Behold, I have created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame, and forges a weapon for his work; and I have created the destroyer to destroy.
ISA 54:17 No weapon that is formed against you will prevail; and you will condemn as guilty every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of Adonai’s servants, and their righteousness is of me,” says Adonai.
ISA 55:1 “Hey! Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters! Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat! Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
ISA 55:2 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Sh'ma ·Hear obey· sh'ma ·hear obey· unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in richness.
ISA 55:3 Turn your ear, and come to me. Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, and your soul will live: and I will make an everlasting covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with you, even to give you the chesed ·loving-kindness· shown to David [Beloved].
ISA 55:4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and enjoiner unto the peoples.
ISA 55:5 Behold, you shall call a nation that you don’t know; and a nation that didn’t know you shall run to you, because of Adonai your God, and for haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails]; for he has glorified you.”
ISA 55:6 Seek Adonai while he may be found. Call on him while he is near.
ISA 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and those who practice vain striving of iniquity his thoughts. Let him make teshuvah ·complete return· to Adonai, and he will have racham ·merciful love· on him; and to our God, for he will freely pardon.
ISA 55:8 “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways,” says Adonai.
ISA 55:9 “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
ISA 55:10 For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky, and does not teshuvah ·completely return· there, but waters the earth, and makes it grow and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
ISA 55:11 so is my word that goes out of my mouth: it will not teshuvah ·completely return· to me void, but it will accomplish that which I please, and it will prosper in the thing I sent it to do.
ISA 55:12 For you shall go out with joy, and be led out with peace. The mountains and the hills will break out before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields will clap their hands.
ISA 55:13 Instead of the thorn the cypress tree will come up; and instead of the brier the myrtle tree will come up: and it will make a name for Adonai, for an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.”
ISA 56:1 Adonai says, “Maintain mishpat ·justice·, and do what is right; for my yishu'ah ·salvation· is near, and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
ISA 56:2 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast; who keeps the Shabath ·Intermission· without profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
ISA 56:3 Let no foreigner, who has joined himself to Adonai, speak, saying, “Adonai will surely separate me from his people.” Do not let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”
ISA 56:4 For Adonai says, “To the eunuchs who keep my Shab'totay ·Intermissions·, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast to my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·:
ISA 56:5 I will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters. I will give them an everlasting name, that will not be cut off.
ISA 56:6 Also the foreigners who join themselves to Adonai, to serve him, and to 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai’s name, to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Shabath ·Intermission· from profaning it, and holds fast my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·;
ISA 56:7 I will bring these to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”
ISA 56:8 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], who gathers the outcasts of Israel [God prevails], says, “I will yet gather others to him, besides his own who are gathered.”
ISA 56:9 All you animals of the field, come to devour, all you animals in the forest.
ISA 56:10 His watchmen are blind. They are all without knowledge. They are all mute dogs. They can’t bark; dreaming, lying down, 'ahav ·affectionately loving· slumber.
ISA 56:11 Yes, the dogs are greedy. They can never have enough. They are shepherds who can’t understand. They have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.
ISA 56:12 “Come,” say they, “I will get wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow will be as today, great beyond measure.”
ISA 57:1 The upright perish, and no one lays it to heart. Men of chesed ·loving-kindness· are taken away, and no one considers that the upright is taken away from the evil.
ISA 57:2 He enters into peace. They rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.
ISA 57:3 “But draw near here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.
ISA 57:4 Whom do you mock? Against whom do you make a wide mouth, and stick out your tongue? Are not you children of a rebellious breach of relationship, and offspring of falsehood,
ISA 57:5 you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
ISA 57:6 Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot. You have even poured a drink offering to them. You have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?
ISA 57:7 On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed. You also went up there to offer sacrifice.
ISA 57:8 You have set up your memorial behind the doors and the posts; for you have exposed yourself to someone besides me, and have gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you a covenant with them. You 'ahav ·affectionately loved· what you saw on their bed.
ISA 57:9 You went to the king with oil, and increased your perfumes, and sent your ambassadors far off, and degraded yourself even to Sheol ·Place of the dead·.
ISA 57:10 You were wearied with the length of your ways; yet you didn’t say, ‘It is in vain.’ You found a reviving of your strength; therefore you were not faint.
ISA 57:11 “Whom have you dreaded and feared, so that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven’t I held my peace for a long time, and you don’t fear me?
ISA 57:12 I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they will not benefit you.
ISA 57:13 When you cry, let those whom you have gathered deliver you; but the wind will take them. A breath will carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me will possess the land, and will inherit my holy mountain.”
ISA 57:14 He will say, “Build up, build up, prepare the way! Remove the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.”
ISA 57:15 For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
ISA 57:16 For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls whom I have made.
ISA 57:17 I was angry because of the depravity (moral evil) of his covetousness, and struck him; I hid myself and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
ISA 57:18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
ISA 57:19 I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near,” says Adonai; “and I will heal them.”
ISA 57:20 But the wicked are like the troubled divorced sea; for it can’t rest, and its waters dirge up mire and mud.
ISA 57:21 “There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
ISA 58:1 “Cry aloud, don’t spare. Lift up your voice like a shofar ·ram horn·. Declare to my people their rebellious breach of relationship, and to the house of Jacob [Supplanter] their habitual sins ·missing the marks·.
ISA 58:2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways. As a nation that did righteousness, and didn’t forsake the judgments of their God, they ask of me upright judgments. They delight to draw near to God.
ISA 58:3 ‘Why have we fasted,’ say they, ‘and you don’t see? Why have we afflicted our soul, and you don’t notice?’ “Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and oppress all your laborers.
ISA 58:4 Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of ethical wickedness. You don’t fast today so as to make your voice to be sh'ma ·heard obeyed· on high.
ISA 58:5 Is this the fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to humble his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Adonai?
ISA 58:6 “Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of ethical wickednes, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?
ISA 58:7 Is not it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?
ISA 58:8 Then your light will break out as the morning, and your healing will appear quickly; then your righteousness shall go before you; and the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing· will be your rear guard.
ISA 58:9 Then you will call, and Adonai will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’ “If you take away from among you the yoke, finger pointing, and speaking vain striving of iniquity;
ISA 58:10 and if you pour out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light will rise in darkness, and your obscurity will be as the noonday;
ISA 58:11 and Adonai will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters don’t fail.
ISA 58:12 Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called Repairer of the Breach, Restorer of Paths with Dwellings.
ISA 58:13 “If you turn away your foot from the Shabath ·Intermission·, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Shabath ·Intermission· a delight, and the holy of Adonai honorable; and shall honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:
ISA 58:14 then you shall delight yourself in Adonai; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob [Supplanter] your father:” for Adonai’s mouth has spoken it.
ISA 59:1 Behold, Adonai’s hand is not shortened, that it can’t save; nor his ear dull, that it can’t sh'ma ·hear obey·.
ISA 59:2 But your depravities (moral evils) have separated you and your God, and your habitual sins ·missing the marks· have hidden his face from you, so that he will not sh'ma ·hear obey·.
ISA 59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with depravity (moral evil). Your lips have spoken lies. Your tongue mutters wickedness.
ISA 59:4 No one sues in righteousness, and no one pleads in truth. They trust in vanity, and speak lies. They conceive mischief, and give birth to vain striving of iniquity.
ISA 59:5 They hatch adders’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web. He who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
ISA 59:6 Their webs won’t become garments. They won’t cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of vain striving of iniquity, and acts of violence are in their hands.
ISA 59:7 Their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of vain striving of iniquity. Desolation and destruction are in their paths.
ISA 59:8 They don’t know the way of peace; and there is no mishpat ·justice· in their ways. They have made crooked paths for themselves; whoever goes in them does not know peace.
ISA 59:9 Therefore is mishpat ·justice· far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us. We look for light, but see darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
ISA 59:10 We grope for the wall like the blind. Yes, we grope as those who have no eyes. We stumble at noon as if it were twilight. Among those who are strong, we are like dead men.
ISA 59:11 We all roar like bears, and moan bitterly like doves. We look for mishpat ·justice·, but there is none; for yishu'ah ·salvation·, but it is far off from us.
ISA 59:12 For our rebellious breaches of relationships are multiplied before you, and our habitual sins ·missing the marks· testify against us; for our rebellious breaches of relationships are with us, and as for our depravities (moral evils), we know them:
ISA 59:13 being rebellious, breaking away from authority thus breaking relationship and denying Adonai, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
ISA 59:14 Mishpat ·Justice· is turned away backward, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness can’t enter.
ISA 59:15 Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. Adonai saw it, and it displeased him that there was no mishpat ·justice·.
ISA 59:16 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness sustained him.
ISA 59:17 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of yishu'ah ·salvation· on his head. He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
ISA 59:18 According to their deeds, he will repay as appropriate, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; he will repay the islands their due.
ISA 59:19 So shall they fear Adonai’s name from the west, and his kavod ·weighty glory· from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which Adonai’s breath drives.
ISA 59:20 “A Redeemer will come to Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], to those in Jacob [Supplanter] who turn from rebellious breach of relationship,” says Adonai .
ISA 59:21 “As for me, this is my covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with them,” says Adonai . “My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your offspring, nor out of the mouth of your offspring’s offspring,” says Adonai , “from henceforth and forever.”
ISA 60:1 “Arise, shine; for your light has come, and Adonai ’s kavod ·weighty glory· has risen on you.
ISA 60:2 For, behold, darkness will cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but Adonai will arise on you, and his kavod ·weighty glory· shall be seen on you.
ISA 60:3 Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.
ISA 60:4 “Lift up your eyes all around, and see: they all gather themselves together. They come to you. Your sons will come from far away, and your daughters will be carried in arms.
ISA 60:5 Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart will thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you. The wealth of the nations will come to you.
ISA 60:6 A multitude of camels will cover you, the dromedaries of Midian [Strife] and Ephah. All from Sheba will come. They will bring gold and frankincense, and will proclaim the tehilahot ·praise songs· of Adonai .
ISA 60:7 All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you. The rams of Nebaioth will serve you. They will be accepted as offerings on my altar; and I will beautify my glorious house.
ISA 60:8 “Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
ISA 60:9 Surely the islands will wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Adonai your God, and for haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails], because he has glorified you.
ISA 60:10 “Foreigners will build up your walls, and their kings will serve you: for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor have I had racham ·compassionate merciful love· on you.
ISA 60:11 Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.
ISA 60:12 For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
ISA 60:13 “The kavod ·weighty glory· of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
ISA 60:14 The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you; and all those who despised you will hawa ·bow low, prostrate· themselves down at the soles of your feet. They will call you Adonai’s City, The Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] of haKadosh Isra'el [the Holy One of God prevails].
ISA 60:15 “Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no one passed through you, I will make you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
ISA 60:16 You will also drink the milk of the nations, and will nurse from royal breasts. Then you will know that I, Adonai, am the One who saves you, your Redeemer, the 'Avir Ya'akov [Mighty One of Supplanter].
ISA 60:17 For bronze I will bring gold; for iron I will bring silver; for wood, bronze, and for stones, iron. I will also make peace your governor, and righteousness your ruler.
ISA 60:18 Violence shall no more be sh'ma ·heard obeyed· in your land, nor desolation or destruction within your borders; but you will call your walls Yishu'ah ·Salvation·, and your gates Tehilah ·Praise song·.
ISA 60:19 The sun will be no more your light by day; nor will the brightness of the moon give light to you, but Adonai will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
ISA 60:20 Your sun will not go down any more, nor will your moon withdraw itself; for Adonai will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will end.
ISA 60:21 Then your people will all be righteous. They will inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
ISA 60:22 The little one will become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation. I, Adonai, will do this quickly in its time.”
ISA 61:1 The Ruach of 'Adonay Yahweh [Spirit, Breath of Lord He sustains breathing] is on me; because Adonai has anointed me to preach good news to the poor and humble. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, to let out into the light those bound in the dark, and to restore the crushed with forgiveness;
ISA 61:2 to proclaim the year of Adonai ’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
ISA 61:3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of tehilah ·praise song· for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Adonai , that he may be glorified.
ISA 61:4 They will rebuild the old ruins. They will raise up the places long devastated. They will repair the ruined cities, that have been devastated for many generations.
ISA 61:5 Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will work your fields and your vineyards.
ISA 61:6 But you will be called Adonai ’s priests. Men will call you the servants of our God. You will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their kavod ·weighty glory·.
ISA 61:7 Instead of your shame you will have double. Instead of dishonor, they will rejoice in their portion. Therefore in their land, they will possess double. Everlasting joy will be to them.
ISA 61:8 “For I, Adonai, 'ahav ·affectionately love· mishpat ·justice·. I hate robbery for burnt offerings. I will give them their reward in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with them.
ISA 61:9 Their offspring will be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge them, that they are the offspring which Adonai has blessed.”
ISA 61:10 I will greatly rejoice in Adonai! My soul will be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of yesha' ·salvation·. He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
ISA 61:11 For as the earth produces its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring up; so 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] will cause righteousness and tehilah ·praise song· to spring up before all the nations.
ISA 62:1 For Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem [City of peace]’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness shines out like the dawn, and her yishu'ah ·salvation· like a blazing torch.
ISA 62:2 The nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your kavod ·weighty glory·, and you will be called by a new name, which Adonai’s mouth will name.
ISA 62:3 You will also be a crown of beauty in Adonai’s hand, and a royal diadem ·crown· in your God’s hand.
ISA 62:4 You will not be called Forsaken any more; nor will your land be called Desolate any more: but you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Adonai delights in you, and your land will be married.
ISA 62:5 For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you. As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you.
ISA 62:6 I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem [City of peace]. They will never be silent day nor night. You who call on Adonai, take no rest,
ISA 62:7 and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem [City of peace] a tehilah ·praise song· in the earth.
ISA 62:8 Adonai has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, “Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies; and foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have labored;
ISA 62:9 but those who have harvested it will eat it, and praise Adonai; and those who have gathered it will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.”
ISA 62:10 Go through, go through the gates! Prepare the way of the people! Build up, build up the highway! Gather out the stones! Lift up a banner for the peoples.
ISA 62:11 Behold, Adonai has sh'ma ·hear obey, proclaimed· unto the end of the earth, “Say to the daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], ‘Behold, your yesha' ·salvation· comes. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.’”
ISA 62:12 They will call them The holy people, Adonai’s redeemed. You will be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
ISA 63:1 Who is this who comes from Edom [Red], with dyed garments from Bozrah? Who this who is glorious in his clothing, marching in the greatness of his strength? “It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”
ISA 63:2 Why is your clothing red, and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?
ISA 63:3 “I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the peoples, no one was with me: Yes, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath. Their life-blood is sprinkled on my garments, and I have stained all my clothing.
ISA 63:4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.
ISA 63:5 I looked, and there was no one to help; and I wondered that there was no one to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my own wrath upheld me.
ISA 63:6 I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their life-blood on the earth.”
ISA 63:7 I will tell of the chesed ·loving-kindnesses· of Adonai and the tehilahot ·praise songs· of Adonai, according to all that Adonai has given to us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel [God prevails], which he has given to them according to his rachamim ·merciful loves·, and according to the multitude of his chesed ·loving-kindnesses·.
ISA 63:8 For he said, “Surely, they are my people, children who will not deal falsely;” so he became their salvation.
ISA 63:9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and ha mal'ak Yahweh [the Angel of He sustains breathing] saved them. In his love and in his pity he redeemed them. He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
ISA 63:10 But they rebelled, and grieved his Ruach Kodesh [Holy Spirit, Breath]. Therefore he turned and became their enemy, and he himself fought against them.
ISA 63:11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [Drawn out] and his people, saying, “Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put his Ruach Kodesh [Holy Spirit, Breath] among them?”
ISA 63:12 Who caused his glorious arm to be at Moses [Drawn out]’ right hand? Who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
ISA 63:13 Who led them through the depths, like a horse in the wilderness, so that they didn’t stumble?
ISA 63:14 As the livestock that go down into the valley, Ruach Yahweh [Spirit, Breath of He sustains breathing] caused them to rest. So you led your people, to make yourself a glorious name.
ISA 63:15 Look down from heaven, and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory. Where are your zeal and your mighty acts? The yearning of your heart and your rachamim ·compassionate loves· is restrained toward me.
ISA 63:16 For you are our Father, though Abraham [Father of a multitude] does not know us, and Israel [God prevails] does not acknowledge us. You, Adonai, are our Father. Our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
ISA 63:17 O Adonai, why do you make us wander from your ways, and harden our heart from your fear? Teshuvah ·Complete return· for your servants’ sake, the tribes of your inheritance.
ISA 63:18 Your holy people possessed it but a little while. Our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
ISA 63:19 We have become like those over whom you never ruled, like those who were not called by your name.
ISA 64:1 Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence.
ISA 64:2 As when fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the water to boil; Make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!
ISA 64:3 When you did awesome things which we didn’t look for, you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence.
ISA 64:4 For from of old men have not sh'ma ·heard·, nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him who waits for him.
ISA 64:5 You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned ·deviated (from the standard goal)·. We have been in violation for a long time. Shall we be saved?
ISA 64:6 For we have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf; and our depravities (moral evils), like the wind, take us away.
ISA 64:7 There is no one who calls on your name, who stirs himself up to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our depravities (moral evils).
ISA 64:8 But now, Adonai, you are our Father. We are the clay, and you our potter. We all are the work of your hand.
ISA 64:9 Don’t be furious, Adonai, and don’t remember depravity (moral evil) forever. Look and see, we beg you, we are all your people.
ISA 64:10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] has become a wilderness, Jerusalem [City of peace] a desolation.
ISA 64:11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
ISA 64:12 Will you hold yourself back for these things, Adonai? Will you keep silent, and punish us very severely?
ISA 65:1 “I am inquired of by those who didn’t ask. I am found by those who didn’t seek me. I said, ‘See me, behold me,’ to a nation that was not called by my name.
ISA 65:2 I have spread out my hands all day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; don’t come near to me,
ISA 65:3 a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;
ISA 65:4 who sit among the graves, and spend nights in secret places; who eat pig’s meat, and their pots hold soup made of disgusting things;
ISA 65:5 who say, ‘Stay by yourself, for I am holier than you.’ These are smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all day.
ISA 65:6 “Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will repay, yes, I will repay into their bosom,
ISA 65:7 your own depravities (moral evils), and the depravities (moral evils) of your fathers together,” says Adonai, “who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills. Therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.”
ISA 65:8 Adonai says, “As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’ so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all.
ISA 65:9 I will bring offspring out of Jacob [Supplanter], and out of Judah [Praised] an inheritor of my mountains. My chosen will inherit it, and my servants will dwell there.
ISA 65:10 Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.
ISA 65:11 “But you who forsake Adonai, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;
ISA 65:12 I will destine you to the sword, and you will all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you didn’t answer. When I spoke, you didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey·; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”
ISA 65:13 Therefore thus says 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh], “Behold, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry; behold, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, my servants will rejoice, but you will be disappointed;
ISA 65:14 Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart, but you will cry for sorrow of heart, and will wail for anguish of spirit.
ISA 65:15 You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and 'Adonay Adonai [Lord Yahweh] will kill you. He will call his servants by another name,
ISA 65:16 so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.
ISA 65:17 “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be remembered, nor come into mind.
ISA 65:18 But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem [City of peace] to be a delight, and her people a joy.
ISA 65:19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem [City of peace], and delight in my people; and the voice of weeping and the voice of crying will be sh'ma ·heard obeyed· in her no more.
ISA 65:20 “No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child will die one hundred years old, and the sinner ·deviant (from the standard goal) person· being one hundred years old will be lightly esteemed.
ISA 65:21 They will build houses, and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
ISA 65:22 They will not build, and another inhabit. They will not plant, and another eat: for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.
ISA 65:23 They will not labor in vain, nor give birth for calamity; for they are the offspring of Adonai’s blessed, and their descendants with them.
ISA 65:24 It will happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will sh'ma ·hear obey·.
ISA 65:25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. Dust will be the serpent’s food. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,” says Adonai.
ISA 66:1 Adonai says, “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build to me? Where will I rest?
ISA 66:2 For my hand has made all these things, and so all these things came to be,” says Adonai: “but to this man will I look, even to he who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.
ISA 66:3 He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog’s neck; he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses a vain striving of iniquity idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations:
ISA 66:4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey·; but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”
ISA 66:5 Sh'ma ·Hear obey· Adonai’s word, you who tremble at his word: “Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name’s sake, have said, ‘Let Adonai be glorified, that we may see your joy;’ but it is those who shall be disappointed.
ISA 66:6 A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Adonai that repays his enemies what they deserve.
ISA 66:7 “Before she travailed, she gave birth. Before her pain came, she delivered a son.
ISA 66:8 Who has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking] travailed, she gave birth to her children.
ISA 66:9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to be delivered?” says Adonai. “Shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?” says your God.
ISA 66:10 “Rejoice with Jerusalem [City of peace], and be glad for her, all you who 'ahav ·affectionately love· her. Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;
ISA 66:11 that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts; that you may drink deeply, and be delighted with the abundance of her kavod ·weighty glory·.”
ISA 66:12 For Adonai says, “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the kavod ·weighty glory· of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you will nurse. You will be carried on her side, and will be dandled on her knees.
ISA 66:13 As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you. You will be comforted in Jerusalem [City of peace].”
ISA 66:14 You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones will flourish like the tender grass. Adonai’s hand will be known among his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.
ISA 66:15 For, behold, Adonai will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
ISA 66:16 For Adonai will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh; and those slain by Adonai will be many.
ISA 66:17 “Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the middle, eating pig’s meat, abominable things, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together,” says Adonai.
ISA 66:18 “For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes that I will gather all nations and languages, and they will come, and will see my kavod ·weighty glory·.
ISA 66:19 “I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to far away islands, who have not sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my fame, nor have seen my kavod ·weighty glory·; and they shall declare my kavod ·weighty glory· among the nations.
ISA 66:20 They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to Adonai, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem [City of peace], says Adonai, as the children of Israel [God prevails] bring their offering in a clean vessel into Adonai’s house.
ISA 66:21 Of them I will also select priests and Levites [Descendants of United with],” says Adonai.
ISA 66:22 “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,” says Adonai, “so your offspring and your name shall remain.
ISA 66:23 It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Shabath ·Intermission· to another Shabath ·Intermission·, all flesh will come to hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship before me,” says Adonai.
ISA 66:24 “They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled to break away from authority thus breaking relationship against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”
1MA 1:1 And it came to pass, after that Alexander the Macedonian, the son of Philip [Loves horses], who came out of the land of Chittim, and struck Darius king of the Persians and Medes [Middle-land], it came to pass, after he had struck him, that he reigned in his stead, in former time, over Greece.
1MA 1:2 And he fought many battles, and won many strongholds, and killed the kings of the earth,
1MA 1:3 and went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of a multitude of nations. And the earth was quiet before him, and he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up,
1MA 1:4 and he gathered together an exceeding strong host, and ruled over countries and nations and principalities, and they became tributary to him.
1MA 1:5 And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that he should die.
1MA 1:6 And he called his servants, which were honorable, which had been brought up with him from his youth, and he divided to them his kingdom, while he was yet alive.
1MA 1:7 And Alexander reigned twelve years, and he died.
1MA 1:8 And his servants bare rule, each one in his place.
1MA 1:9 And they did all put diadems ·crowns· upon themselves after that he was dead, and so did their sons after them many years: and they multiplied evils in the earth.
1MA 1:10 And there came forth out of them a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage at Rome [Town of flowing waters], and he reigned in the one hundred thirty seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.
1MA 1:11 In those days came there forth out of Israel [God prevails] transgressors of Torah ·Teaching·, and persuaded many, saying, let us go and make a covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· with the Gentiles that are round about us; for since we were parted from them many evils have befallen us.
1MA 1:12 And the saying was good in their eyes.
1MA 1:13 And certain of the people were forward herein and went to the king, and he gave them license to do after the ordinances of the Gentiles.
1MA 1:14 And they built a place of exercise in Jerusalem [City of peace] according to the laws of the Gentiles;
1MA 1:15 and they made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, and joined themselves to the Gentiles, and sold themselves to do evil.
1MA 1:16 And the kingdom was well ordered in the sight of Antiochus, and he thought to reign over Egypt [Abode of slavery], that he might reign over the two kingdoms.
1MA 1:17 And he entered into Egypt [Abode of slavery] with a great multitude, with chariots, and with elephants, and with horsemen, and with a great navy;
1MA 1:18 and he made war against Ptolemy king of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; and Ptolemy was put to shame before him, and fled; and many fell wounded to death.
1MA 1:19 And they got possession of the strong cities in the land of Egypt [Abode of slavery]; and he took the spoils of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
1MA 1:20 And Antiochus, after that he had struck Egypt [Abode of slavery], returned in the one hundred forty third year, and went up against Israel [God prevails] and Jerusalem [City of peace] with a great multitude,
1MA 1:21 and entered presumptuously into the sanctuary, and took the golden altar (of incence), and the menorah ·lamp· of the light, and all that pertained there,
1MA 1:22 and the table of the show bread, and the cups to pour withal, and the bowls, and the golden censers, and the veil, and the crowns, and the adorning of gold which was on the face of the temple, and he scaled it all off.
1MA 1:23 And he took the silver and the gold and the precious utensils; and he took the hidden treasures which he found.
1MA 1:24 And when he had taken all, he went away into his own land, and he made a great slaughter, and spoke very presumptuously.
1MA 1:25 And there came great mourning upon Israel [God prevails], in every place where they were;
1MA 1:26 and the rulers and elders groaned, the virgins and young men were made feeble, and the beauty of the women was changed.
1MA 1:27 Every bridegroom took up lamentation, she that sat in the marriage chamber was in heaviness.
1MA 1:28 And the land was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob [Supplanter] was clothed with shame.
1MA 1:29 And after two full years the king sent a chief collector of tribute to the cities of Judah [Praised], and he came to Jerusalem [City of peace] with a great multitude.
1MA 1:30 And he spoke words of peace to them in subtelty, and they gave him credence: and he fell upon the city suddenly, and struck it very sore, and destroyed much people out of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 1:31 And he took the spoils of the city, and set it on fire, and pulled down the houses thereof and the walls thereof on every side.
1MA 1:32 And they led captive the women and the children, and the cattle they took in possession.
1MA 1:33 And they built the city of David [Beloved] with a great and strong wall, with strong towers, and it became to them a fortress.
1MA 1:34 And they put there a sinful nation, transgressors of Torah ·Teaching·, and they strengthened themselves therein.
1MA 1:35 And they stored up arms and food, and gathering together the spoils of Jerusalem [City of peace], they laid them up there, and they became a sore snare:
1MA 1:36 and it became a place to lie in wait in against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel [God prevails] continually.
1MA 1:37 And they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled the sanctuary.
1MA 1:38 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem [City of peace] fled because of them; and she became a habitation of strangers, and she became strange to them that were born in her, and her children forsook her.
1MA 1:39 Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her Shabbatot ·To cease· into reproach, her honor into contempt.
1MA 1:40 According to her glory, so was her dishonor multiplied, and her high estate was turned into mourning.
1MA 1:41 And king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all should be one people,
1MA 1:42 and that each should forsake his own laws. And all the nations agreed according to the word of the king;
1MA 1:43 and many of Israel [God prevails] consented to his worship, and sacrificed to the idols, and profaned the Sabbath ·To cease·.
1MA 1:44 And the king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem [City of peace] and the cities of Judah [Praised], that they should follow laws strange to the land,
1MA 1:45 and should forbid whole burnt offerings and sacrifice and drink offerings in the sanctuary; and should profane the Shabbatot ·To cease· and feasts,
1MA 1:46 and pollute the sanctuary and them that were holy;
1MA 1:47 that they should build altars, and temples, and shrines for idols, and should sacrifice swine’s flesh and unclean beasts:
1MA 1:48 and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, that they should make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation;
1MA 1:49 so that they might forget Torah ·Teaching·, and change all the ordinances.
1MA 1:50 And whoever shall not do according to the word of the king, he shall die.
1MA 1:51 According to all these words wrote he to his whole kingdom; and he appointed overseers over all the people, and he commanded the cities of Judah [Praised] to sacrifice, city by city.
1MA 1:52 And from the people were gathered together to them many, every one that had forsaken Torah ·Teaching·; and they did evil things in the land;
1MA 1:53 and they made Israel to hide themselves in every place of refuge which they had.
1MA 1:54 And on the fifteenth day of Chislev [Trust / Security / Folly / 9th month], in the one hundred forty fifth year, they built an abomination of desolation upon the altar (of burnt offerings), and in the cities of Judah [Praised] on every side they built idol altars.
1MA 1:55 And at the doors of the houses and in the streets they burned incense.
1MA 1:56 And they tore in pieces the books of Torah ·Teaching· which they found, and set them on fire.
1MA 1:57 And wherever was found with any a book of the covenant, and if any consented to Torah ·Teaching·, the king’s sentence delivered him to death.
1MA 1:58 Thus did they in their might to Israel [God prevails], to those that were found month by month in the cities.
1MA 1:59 And on the twenty fifth day of the month they sacrificed on the pagan altar that was over the altar (of burnt offerings) of Yah.
1MA 1:60 And the women that had circumcised their children they put to death according to the commandment.
1MA 1:61 And they hanged their babes about their necks, and destroyed their houses, and them that had circumcised them.
1MA 1:62 And many in Israel [God prevails] were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat unclean things.
1MA 1:63 And they chose to die, that they might not be defiled with the meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant: and they died.
1MA 1:64 And there came exceeding great wrath upon Israel [God prevails].
1MA 2:1 In those days rose up Mattathias [Gift of Yah] the son of John [Yah is gracious], the son of Simeon [Hearing], a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem [City of peace]; and he lived at Modin.
1MA 2:2 And he had five sons, John [Yah is gracious], who was surnamed Gaddis;
1MA 2:3 Simeon [Hearing], who was called Thassi;
1MA 2:4 Judas [Praised], who was called Maccabaeus [Hammer];
1MA 2:5 Eleazar [Help of God], who was called Avaran; Jonathan [Yah has given], who was called Apphus.
1MA 2:6 And he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Judah [Praised] and in Jerusalem [City of peace],
1MA 2:7 and he said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see the destruction of my people, and the destruction of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it was given into the hand of the enemy, the sanctuary into the hand of aliens?
1MA 2:8 Her temple is become as a man that was glorious:
1MA 2:9 her utensils of glory are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in her streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy.
1MA 2:10 What nation has not inherited her palaces, and gotten possession of her spoils?
1MA 2:11 her adorning is all taken away; instead of a free woman she is become a bond woman:
1MA 2:12 and, behold, our holy things and our beauty and our glory are laid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned them.
1MA 2:13 Wherefore should we live any longer?
1MA 2:14 And Mattathias [Gift of Yah] and his sons tore their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned exceedingly.
1MA 2:15 And the king’s officers, that were enforcing the apostasy, came into the city Modin to sacrifice.
1MA 2:16 And many of Israel [God prevails] came to them, and Mattathias [Gift of Yah] and his sons were gathered together.
1MA 2:17 And the king’s officers answered and spoke to Mattathias [Gift of Yah], saying, You are a ruler and a honorable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren:
1MA 2:18 now therefore come you first and do the commandment of the king, as all the nations have done, and the men of Judah [Praised], and they that remain in Jerusalem [City of peace]: and you and your house shall be in the number of the king’s Friends, and you and your sons shall be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.
1MA 2:19 And Mattathias [Gift of Yah] answered and said with a loud voice, If all the nations that are in the house of the king’s dominion hearken to him, to fall away each one from the worship of his fathers, and have made choice to follow his commandments,
1MA 2:20 yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers.
1MA 2:21 Heaven forbid that we should forsake Torah ·Teaching· and the ordinances.
1MA 2:22 We will not hearken to the king’s words, to go aside from our worship, on the right hand, or on the left.
1MA 2:23 And when he had left speaking these words, there came a Jew [Praiser] in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar (of burnt offerings) which was at Modin, according to the king’s commandment.
1MA 2:24 And Mattathias [Gift of Yah] saw it, and his zeal was kindled, and his reins trembled, and he showed forth his wrath according to judgement, and ran, and killed him upon the altar (of burnt offerings).
1MA 2:25 And the king’s officer, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and pulled down the altar (of burnt offerings).
1MA 2:26 And he was zealous for Torah ·Teaching·, even as Pinchas [Bronze skin] did to Zimri the son of Salu.
1MA 2:27 And Mattathias [Gift of Yah] cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous for Torah ·Teaching·, and maintains the covenant, let him come forth after me.
1MA 2:28 And he and his sons fled into the mountains, and forsook all that they had in the city.
1MA 2:29 Then many that sought after justice and judgement went down into the wilderness, to dwell there,
1MA 2:30 they, and their sons, and their wives, and their cattle; because evils were multiplied upon them.
1MA 2:31 And it was told the king’s officers, and the forces that were in Jerusalem [City of peace], the city of David [Beloved], that certain men, who had broken the king’s commandment, were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness;
1MA 2:32 and many pursued after them, and having overtaken them, they encamped against them, and set the battle in array against them on the Sabbath ·To cease· day.
1MA 2:33 And they said to them, Thus far. Come forth, and do according to the word of the king, and you shall live.
1MA 2:34 And they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath ·To cease· day.
1MA 2:35 And they hasted to give them battle.
1MA 2:36 And they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped up the secret places,
1MA 2:37 saying, Let us die all in our innocence: heaven and earth witness over us, that you put us to death without trial.
1MA 2:38 And they rose up against them in battle on the Sabbath ·To cease·, and they died, they and their wives and their children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand souls.
1MA 2:39 And Mattathias [Gift of Yah] and his friends knew it, and they mourned over them exceedingly.
1MA 2:40 And one said to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not against the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, they will now quickly destroy us from off the earth.
1MA 2:41 And they took counsel on that day, saying, whoever shall come against us to battle on the Sabbath ·To cease· day, let us fight against him, and we shall in no wise all die, as our brethren died in the secret places.
1MA 2:42 Then were gathered together to them a company of Chasidim [Pious Ones], mighty men of Israel [God prevails], every one that offered himself willingly for Torah ·Teaching·.
1MA 2:43 And all they that fled from the evils were added to them, and became a stay to them.
1MA 2:44 And they mustered a host, and struck sinners in their anger, and men departing from Torah ·Teaching· in their wrath: and the rest fled to the Gentiles for safety.
1MA 2:45 And Mattathias [Gift of Yah] and his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars;
1MA 2:46 and they circumcised by force the children that were uncircumcised, as many as they found in the coasts of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 2:47 And they pursued after the sons of pride, and the work prospered in their hand.
1MA 2:48 And they rescued Torah ·Teaching· out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of the kings, neither suffered they the sinner to triumph.
1MA 2:49 And the days of Mattathias [Gift of Yah] drew near that he should die, and he said to his sons, Now have pride and rebuke gotten strength, and a season of overthrow, and wrath of indignation.
1MA 2:50 And now, my children, be you zealous for Torah ·Teaching·, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.
1MA 2:51 And call to remembrance the deeds of our fathers which they did in their generations; and receive great glory and an everlasting name.
1MA 2:52 Was not Abraham [Father of a multitude] found faithful in temptation, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness?
1MA 2:53 Joseph [May he add] in the time of his distress kept the commandment, and became lord of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
1MA 2:54 Pinchas [Bronze skin] our father, for that he was zealous exceedingly, obtained the covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· of an everlasting priesthood.
1MA 2:55 Joshua [Salvation Yah] for fulfilling the word became a judge in Israel [God prevails].
1MA 2:56 Caleb [Dog] for bearing witness in the congregation obtained a heritage in the land.
1MA 2:57 David [Beloved] for being merciful inherited the throne of a kingdom forever and ever.
1MA 2:58 Elijah [My God Yah], for that he was exceeding zealous for Torah ·Teaching·, was taken up into heaven.
1MA 2:59 Hananiah, Azariah, Mishael, trusted, and were saved out of the flame.
1MA 2:60 Daniel [My judge is God] for his innocence was delivered from the mouth of lions.
1MA 2:61 And thus consider you from generation to generation, that none that put their trust in him shall lack for strength.
1MA 2:62 And be not afraid of the words of a sinful man; for his glory shall be dung and worms.
1MA 2:63 Today he shall be lifted up, and tomorrow he shall in no wise be found, because he is returned to his dust, and his thought is perished.
1MA 2:64 And you, my children, be strong, and show yourselves men in behalf of Torah ·Teaching·; for therein shall you obtain glory.
1MA 2:65 And, behold, Simeon [Hearing] your brother, I know that he is a man of counsel; give ear to him always: he shall be a father to you.
1MA 2:66 And Judas Maccabee [Praised Hammer], he has been strong and mighty from his youth: he shall be your captain, and shall fight the battle of the people.
1MA 2:67 And take you to you all the doers of Torah ·Teaching·, and avenge the wrong of your people.
1MA 2:68 Render a recompense to the Gentiles, and take heed to the commandments of Torah ·Teaching·.
1MA 2:69 And he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.
1MA 2:70 And he died in the one hundred forty sixth year, and his sons buried him in the sepulchers of his fathers at Modin, and all Israel [God prevails] made great lamentation for him.
1MA 3:1 And his son Judas [Praised], who was called Maccabaeus [Hammer], rose up in his stead.
1MA 3:2 And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that clave to his father, and they fought with gladness the battle of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 3:3 And he got his people great glory, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girded his warlike harness about him, and set battles in array, protecting the army with his sword.
1MA 3:4 And he was like a lion in his deeds, and as a lion’s whelp roaring for prey.
1MA 3:5 And he pursued those departing from Torah ·Teaching·, seeking them out, and he burned up those that troubled his people.
1MA 3:6 And those departing from Torah ·Teaching· shrunk for fear of him, and all the people promoting distance from Torah ·Teaching· were sore troubled, and salvation prospered in his hand.
1MA 3:7 And he angered many kings, and made Jacob [Supplanter] glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed forever.
1MA 3:8 And he went about among the cities of Judah [Praised], and destroyed the ungodly out of the land, and turned away wrath from Israel [God prevails]:
1MA 3:9 and he was renowned to the utmost part of the earth, and he gathered together such as were ready to perish.
1MA 3:10 And Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host from Samaria, to fight against Israel [God prevails].
1MA 3:11 And Judas [Praised] perceived it, and he went forth to meet him, and struck him, and killed him: and many fell wounded to death, and the rest fled.
1MA 3:12 And they took their spoils, and Judas [Praised] took the sword of Apollonius, and therewith he fought all his days.
1MA 3:13 And Seron, the commander of the host of Syria [Elevated], heard say that Judas [Praised] had gathered a gathering and a congregation of faithful men with him, and of such as went out to war;
1MA 3:14 And he said, I will make myself a name and get me glory in the kingdom; and I will fight against Judas [Praised] and them that are with him, that set at nothing the word of the king.
1MA 3:15 And there went up with him also a mighty army of the ungodly to help him, to take vengeance on the children of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 3:16 And he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, and Judas [Praised] went forth to meet him with a small company.
1MA 3:17 But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas [Praised], What? shall we be able, being a small company, to fight against so great and strong a multitude? and we for our part are faint, having tasted no food this day.
1MA 3:18 And Judas [Praised] said, It is an easy thing for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with heaven (God) it is all one, to save by many or by few:
1MA 3:19 for victory in battle stands not in the multitude of a host; but strength is from heaven (God).
1MA 3:20 They come to us in fulness of insolence and distance from Torah ·Teaching·, to destroy us and our wives and our children, for to spoil us:
1MA 3:21 but we fight for our lives and our laws.
1MA 3:22 And he himself will embarrass them before our face: but as for you, be you not afraid of them.
1MA 3:23 Now when he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and Seron and his army were embarrassed before him.
1MA 3:24 And they pursued them in the going down of Bethhoron to the plain, and there fell of them about eight hundred men; but the residue fled into the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)].
1MA 3:25 And the fear of Judas [Praised] and his brethren, and the dread of them, began to fall upon the nations round about them:
1MA 3:26 and his name came near even to the king, and every nation told of the battles of Judas [Praised].
1MA 3:27 But when king Antiochus heard these words, he was full of indignation: and he sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, an exceeding strong army.
1MA 3:28 And he opened his treasury, and gave his forces pay for a year, and commanded them to be ready for every need.
1MA 3:29 And he saw that the money failed from his treasures, and that the tributes of the country were small, because of the dissension and plague which he had brought upon the land, to the end that he might take away the laws which had been from the first days;
1MA 3:30 and he feared that he should not have enough as at other times for the charges and the gifts which he gave aforetime with a liberal hand, and he abounded above the kings that were before him.
1MA 3:31 And he was exceedingly perplexed in his mind, and he determined to go into Persia [Descendants of Loving-kindness], and to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money.
1MA 3:32 And he left Lysias, an honorable man, and one of the seed royal, to be over the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates [Fruitful] to the borders of Egypt [Abode of slavery],
1MA 3:33 and to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again.
1MA 3:34 And he delivered to him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all the things that he would have done, and concerning them that lived in Judea [Praise] and in Jerusalem [City of peace],
1MA 3:35 that he should send a host against them, to root out and destroy the strength of Israel [God prevails], and the remnant of Jerusalem [City of peace], and to take away their memorial from the place;
1MA 3:36 And that he should make strangers to dwell on all their coasts, and should divide their land to them by lot.
1MA 3:37 And the king took the half that remained of the forces, and removed from Antioch, from his royal city, the one hundred forty seventh year; and he passed over the river Euphrates [Fruitful], and went through the upper countries.
1MA 3:38 And Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king’s Friends;
1MA 3:39 and with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horse, to go into the land of Judah [Praised], and to destroy it, according to the word of the king.
1MA 3:40 And they removed with all their host, and came and pitched near to Emmaus in the plain country.
1MA 3:41 And the merchants of the country heard the fame of them, and took silver and gold exceeding much, with servants, and came into the camp to take the children of Israel [God prevails] for servants: and there were added to them the forces of Syria [Elevated] and of the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)].
1MA 3:42 And Judas [Praised] and his brethren saw that evils were multiplied, and that the forces were encamping in their borders; and they took knowledge of the king’s words which he had commanded, to destroy the people and make an end of them;
1MA 3:43 and they said each man to his neighbor, Let us raise up the ruin of our people, and let us fight for our people and the holy place.
1MA 3:44 And the congregation was gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask for mercy and compassion.
1MA 3:45 And Jerusalem [City of peace] was without inhabitant as a wilderness, there was none of her offspring that went in or went out; and the sanctuary was trodden down, and the sons of strangers were in the fortress, the Gentiles lodged therein; and joy was taken away from Jacob [Supplanter], and the pipe and the harp ceased.
1MA 3:46 And they gathered themselves together, and came to Mizpeh, over against Jerusalem [City of peace]; for in Mizpeh was there a place of prayer aforetime for Israel [God prevails].
1MA 3:47 And they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and put ashes upon their heads, and tore their clothes,
1MA 3:48 and laid open the book of Torah ·Teaching·, concerning which the Gentiles were wont to inquire, seeking the likenesses of their idols.
1MA 3:49 And they brought the priests’ garments, and the first fruits, and the tithes: and they stirred up the Nazarites, who had accomplished their days.
1MA 3:50 And they cried aloud toward heaven (God), saying, What shall we do with these men, and where shall we carry them away?
1MA 3:51 And your holy place is trodden down and profaned, and your priests are in heaviness and brought low.
1MA 3:52 And, behold, the Gentiles are assembled together against us to destroy us: you know what things they imagine against us.
1MA 3:53 How shall we be able to stand before them, except you be our help?
1MA 3:54 And they sounded with the trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.
1MA 3:55 And after this Judas [Praised] appointed leaders of the people, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens.
1MA 3:56 And he said to them that were building houses, and were betrothing wives, and were planting vineyards, and were fearful, that they should return, each man to his own house, according to Torah ·Teaching·.
1MA 3:57 And the army removed, and encamped upon the south side of Emmaus.
1MA 3:58 And Judas [Praised] said, Gird yourselves, and be valiant men, and be in readiness against the morning, that you may fight with these Gentiles, that are assembled together against us to destroy us, and our holy place:
1MA 3:59 for it is better for us to die in battle, than to look upon the evils of our nation and the holy place.
1MA 3:60 Nevertheless, as may be the will in heaven (God), so shall he do.
1MA 4:1 And Gorgias took five thousand footmen, and a thousand chosen horse, and the army removed by night,
1MA 4:2 that it might fall upon the army of the Jews [Praisers] and strike them suddenly: and the men of the fortress were his guides.
1MA 4:3 And Judas [Praised] heard thereof, and removed, he and the valiant men, that he might strike the king’s host which was at Emmaus,
1MA 4:4 while as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.
1MA 4:5 And Gorgias came into the camp of Judas [Praised] by night, and found no man; and he sought them in the mountains; for he said, These men flee from us.
1MA 4:6 And as soon as it was day, Judas [Praised] appeared in the plain with three thousand men: howbeit they had not armor nor swords to their minds.
1MA 4:7 And they saw the camp of the Gentiles strong and fortified, and horsemen compassing it round about; and these were expert in war.
1MA 4:8 And Judas [Praised] said to the men that were with him, Fear you not their multitude, neither be you afraid of their onset.
1MA 4:9 Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with a host.
1MA 4:10 And now let us cry to heaven (God), if he will have us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this army before our face today:
1MA 4:11 and all the Gentiles shall know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel [God prevails].
1MA 4:12 And the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them:
1MA 4:13 and they went out of the camp to battle. And they that were with Judas [Praised] sounded their trumpets,
1MA 4:14 and joined battle, and the Gentiles were embarrassed, and fled into the plain.
1MA 4:15 But all the hindmost fell by the sword: and they pursued them to Gazara, and to the plains of Idumaea and Azotus and Jamnia, and there fell of them about three thousand men.
1MA 4:16 And Judas [Praised] and his host returned from pursuing after them,
1MA 4:17 and he said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoils, inasmuch as there is a battle before us;
1MA 4:18 and Gorgias and his host are near to us in the mountain. But stand you now against our enemies, and fight against them, and afterwards take the spoils with boldness.
1MA 4:19 While Judas [Praised] was yet making an end of these words, there appeared a part of them looking out from the mountain:
1MA 4:20 and they saw that their host had been put to flight, and that the Jews [Praisers] were burning the camp; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done.
1MA 4:21 But when they perceived these things, they were sore afraid; and perceiving also the army of Judas [Praised] in the plain ready for battle,
1MA 4:22 they fled all of them into the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)].
1MA 4:23 And Judas [Praised] returned to spoil the camp, and they got much gold, and silver, and blue, and sea purple, and great riches.
1MA 4:24 And they returned home, and sang a song of thanksgiving, and gave praise to heaven (God); because his mercy is good, because his mercy endures forever.
1MA 4:25 And Israel [God prevails] had a great deliverance that day.
1MA 4:26 But the strangers, as many as had escaped, came and told Lysias all the things that had happened:
1MA 4:27 but when he heard thereof, he was confounded and discouraged, because neither had such things as he would been done to Israel [God prevails], nor had such things as the king commanded him come to pass.
1MA 4:28 And in the next year he gathered together sixtieth thousand chosen footmen, and five thousand horse, that he might subdue them.
1MA 4:29 And they came into Idumaea, and encamped at Bethsura; and Judas [Praised] met them with ten thousand men.
1MA 4:30 And he saw that the army was strong, and he prayed and said, Blessed are you, O Savior of Israel [God prevails], who did quell the onset of the mighty man by the hand of your servant David [Beloved], and did deliver the army of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)] into the hands of Jonathan [Yah has given] the son of Saul [Asked for], and of his armor bearer:
1MA 4:31 shut up this army in the hand of your people Israel [God prevails], and let them be ashamed for their host and their horsemen:
1MA 4:32 give them faintness of heart, and cause the boldness of their strength to melt away, and let them quake at their destruction:
1MA 4:33 cast them down with the sword of them that love you, and let all that know your name praise you with thanksgiving.
1MA 4:34 And they joined battle; and there fell of the army of Lysias about five thousand men, and they fell down over against them.
1MA 4:35 But when Lysias saw that his array was put to flight, and the boldness that had come upon them that were with Judas [Praised], and how they were ready either to live or to die nobly, he removed to Antioch, and gathered together hired soldiers, that he might come again into Judea [Praise] with even a greater company.
1MA 4:36 But Judas [Praised] and his brethren said, Behold, our enemies are embarrassed: let us go up to cleanse the holy place, and to dedicate it afresh.
1MA 4:37 And all the army was gathered together, and they went up to mount Sion.
1MA 4:38 And they saw the sanctuary laid desolate, and the altar (of burnt offerings) profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in the outer courts as in a forest or as on one of the mountains, and the priests’ chambers pulled down;
1MA 4:39 and they tore their clothes, and made great lamentation, and put ashes upon their heads,
1MA 4:40 and fell on their faces to the ground, and blew with the solemn trumpets, and cried toward heaven (God).
1MA 4:41 Then Judas [Praised] appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he should have cleansed the holy place.
1MA 4:42 And he chose blameless priests, such as had pleasure in Torah ·Teaching·:
1MA 4:43 and they cleansed the holy place, and bare out the stones of defilement into an unclean place.
1MA 4:44 And they took counsel concerning the altar of burnt offerings, which had been profaned, what they should do with it:
1MA 4:45 and there came into their mind a good counsel, that they should pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the Gentiles had defiled it: and they pulled down the altar (of burnt offerings),
1MA 4:46 and laid up the stones in the mountain of the house in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to give an answer concerning them.
1MA 4:47 And they took whole stones according to Torah ·Teaching·, and built a new altar (of burnt offerings) after the fashion of the former;
1MA 4:48 and they built the holy place, and the inner parts of the temple; and they set apart the outer courts.
1MA 4:49 And they made the holy vessels new, and they brought the menorah ·lamp·, and the altar of burnt offerings and altar of incense, and the table, into the temple.
1MA 4:50 And they burned incense upon the altar, and they lighted the menorah ·lamp· candles that were upon the menorah ·lamp·, and they gave light in the temple.
1MA 4:51 And they set loaves upon the table of the show bread, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works which they made.
1MA 4:52 And they rose up early in the morning, on the twenty fifth day of the ninth month, which is Kislev ·Trust security / Folly, 9·, in the one hundred forty eighth year,
1MA 4:53 and offered sacrifice according to Torah ·Teaching· upon the new altar of burned offerings which they had made.
1MA 4:54 At what time and on what day the Gentiles had profaned it, even on that day was it dedicated afresh, with songs and harps and lutes, and with cymbals.
1MA 4:55 And all the people fell upon their faces, and worshiped, and gave praise to heaven (God), which had given them good success.
1MA 4:56 And they kept the dedication of the altar (of burnt offerings) eight days, and offered burned offerings with gladness, and sacrificed a sacrifice of deliverance and praise.
1MA 4:57 And they decked the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold and small shields, and dedicated afresh the gates and the priests’ chambers, and made doors for them.
1MA 4:58 And there was exceeding great gladness among the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was turned away.
1MA 4:59 And Judas [Praised] and his brethren and the whole congregation of Israel [God prevails] ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar (of burnt offerings) should be kept in their seasons from year to year by the space of eight days, from the twenty fifth day of the month Chislev [Trust / Security / Folly / 9th month], with gladness and joy.
1MA 4:60 And at that season they built up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest haply the Gentiles should come and tread them down, as they had done aforetime.
1MA 4:61 And he set there a force to keep it, and they fortified Bethsura to keep it; that the people might have a stronghold over against Idumaea.
1MA 5:1 And it came to pass, when the Gentiles round about heard that the altar (of burnt offerings) was built, and the sanctuary dedicated as aforetime, they were exceeding angry.
1MA 5:2 And they took counsel to destroy the race of Jacob [Supplanter] that was in the midst of them, and they began to kill and destroy among the people.
1MA 5:3 And Judas [Praised] fought against the children of Esau [Hairy] in Idumaea at Akrabattine, because they besieged Israel [God prevails]: and he struck them with a great slaughter, and brought down their pride, and took their spoils.
1MA 5:4 And he remembered the wickedness of the children of Baean, who were to the people a snare and a stumbling block, lying in wait for them in the ways.
1MA 5:5 And they were shut up by him in the towers; and he encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burned with fire the towers of the place, with all that were therein.
1MA 5:6 And he passed over to the children of Ammon [Tribal people], and found a mighty band, and much people, with Timotheus for their leader.
1MA 5:7 And he fought many battles with them, and they were embarrassed before his face; and he struck them,
1MA 5:8 and got possession of Jazer, and the villages thereof, and returned again into Judea [Praise].
1MA 5:9 And the Gentiles that were in Gilead gathered themselves together against the Israelites that were on their borders, to destroy them. And they fled to the stronghold of Dathema,
1MA 5:10 and sent letters to Judas [Praised] and his brethren, saying, The Gentiles that are round about us are gathered together against us to destroy us:
1MA 5:11 and they are preparing to come and get possession of the stronghold whereunto we fled for refuge, and Timotheus is the leader of their host.
1MA 5:12 Now therefore come and deliver us from their hand, for many of us are fallen.
1MA 5:13 And all our brethren that were in the land of Tubias have been put to death; and they have carried into captivity their wives and their children and their stuff; and they destroyed there about a thousand men.
1MA 5:14 While the letters were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee [District, Circuit] with their clothes tore, bringing a report after this wise,
1MA 5:15 saying, That there were gathered together against them those of Ptolemais, and of Tyre, and of Sidon, and all Galil-of-the-Goyim [District, Circuit of Non-Jews] to consume them.
1MA 5:16 Now when Judas [Praised] and the people heard these words, there assembled together a great congregation, to consult what they should do for their brethren, that were in tribulation, and were assaulted of them.
1MA 5:17 And Judas [Praised] said to Simeon [Hearing] his brother, Choose you out men, and go and deliver your brethren that are in Galilee [District, Circuit], but I and Jonathan [Yah has given] my brother will go into the land of Gilead.
1MA 5:18 And he left Joseph [May he add] the son of Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], and Azarias, as leaders of the people, with the remnant of the host, in Judea [Praise], for to keep it.
1MA 5:19 And he gave commandment to them, saying, Take you the charge of this people, and fight no battle with the Gentiles until that we come again.
1MA 5:20 And to Simeon [Hearing] were divided three thousand men to go into Galilee [District, Circuit], but to Judas [Praised] eight thousand men to go into the land of Gilead.
1MA 5:21 And Simeon [Hearing] went into Galilee [District, Circuit], and fought many battles with the Gentiles, and the Gentiles were embarrassed before him.
1MA 5:22 And he pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais; and there fell of the Gentiles about three thousand men, and he took their spoils.
1MA 5:23 And they took to them those that were in Galilee [District, Circuit], and in Arbatta, with their wives and their children, and all that they had, and brought them into Judea [Praise] with great gladness.
1MA 5:24 And Judas [Praised] Maccabee [Praised Hammer] and his brother Jonathan [Yah has given] passed over Jordan [Descender], and went three days’ journey in the wilderness;
1MA 5:25 and they met with the Nabathaeans, and these met them in a peaceful manner, and told them all things that had befallen their brethren in the land of Gilead:
1MA 5:26 and how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great:
1MA 5:27 and how that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the land of Gilead, and that tomorrow they have appointed to encamp against the strongholds, and to take them, and to destroy all these men in one day.
1MA 5:28 And Judas [Praised] and his army turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness to Bosora; and he took the city, and killed all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire.
1MA 5:29 And he removed from thence by night, and went till he came to the stronghold.
1MA 5:30 And the morning came, and they lifted up their eyes, and, behold, much people which could not be counted, bearing ladders and engines of war, to take the stronghold; and they were fighting against them.
1MA 5:31 And Judas [Praised] saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven (God), with trumpets and a great sound,
1MA 5:32 and he said to the men of his host, Fight this day for your brethren.
1MA 5:33 And he went forth behind them in three companies, and they sounded with their trumpets, and cried out in prayer.
1MA 5:34 And the army of Timotheus perceived that it was Maccabaeus [Hammer], and they fled from before him: and he struck them with a great slaughter; and there fell of them on that day about eight thousand men.
1MA 5:35 And he turned aside to Mizpeh and fought against it, and took it, and killed all the males thereof, and took the spoils thereof, and burned it with fire.
1MA 5:36 From thence he removed, and took Casphor, Maked, Bosor, and the other cities of the land of Gilead.
1MA 5:37 Now after these things Timotheus gathered another army, and encamped over against Raphon beyond the brook.
1MA 5:38 And Judas [Praised] sent men to spy on the army; and they brought him word, saying, All the Gentiles that be round about us are gathered together to them, an exceeding great host.
1MA 5:39 And they have hired Arabians to help them, and are encamping beyond the brook, ready to come against you to battle. And Judas [Praised] went to meet them.
1MA 5:40 And Timotheus said to the captains of his host, when Judas [Praised] and his army drew near to the brook of water, If he pass over first to us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against us:
1MA 5:41 but if he be afraid, and encamp beyond the river, we will cross over to him, and prevail against him.
1MA 5:42 Now when Judas [Praised] came near to the brook of water, he caused the Torah-Teachers of the people to remain by the brook, and gave commandment to them, saying, Suffer no man to encamp, but let all come to the battle.
1MA 5:43 And he crossed over the first against them, and all the people after him: and all the Gentiles were embarrassed before his face, and cast away their arms, and fled to the temple at Carnaim.
1MA 5:44 And they took the city, and burned the temple with fire, together with all that were therein. And Carnaim was subdued, neither could they stand any longer before the face of Judas [Praised].
1MA 5:45 And Judas [Praised] gathered together all Israel [God prevails], them that were in the land of Gilead, from the least to the greatest, and their wives, and their children, and their stuff, an exceeding great army, that they might come into the land of Judah [Praised].
1MA 5:46 And they came as far as Ephron [Fawn-like], and this same city was great, and it was in the way as they should go, exceeding strong: they could not turn aside from it on the right hand or on the left, but must needs pass through the midst of it.
1MA 5:47 And they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones.
1MA 5:48 And Judas [Praised] sent to them with words of peace, saying, We will pass through your land to go into our own land, and none shall do you any hurt, we will only pass by on our feet. And they would not open to him.
1MA 5:49 And Judas [Praised] commanded proclamation to be made in the army, that each man should encamp in the place where he was.
1MA 5:50 And the men of the host encamped, and fought against the city all that day and all that night, and the city was delivered into his hands;
1MA 5:51 and he destroyed all the males with the edge of the sword, and razed the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through the city over them that were slain.
1MA 5:52 And they went over Jordan [Descender] into the great plain over against Bethshan.
1MA 5:53 And Judas [Praised] gathered together those that lagged behind, and encouraged the people all the way through, until he came into the land of Judah [Praised].
1MA 5:54 And they went up to mount Sion with gladness and joy, and offered whole burnt offerings, because not so much as one of them was slain until they returned in peace.
1MA 5:55 And in the days when Judas [Praised] and Jonathan [Yah has given] were in the land of Gilead, and Simeon [Hearing] his brother in Galilee [District, Circuit] before Ptolemais,
1MA 5:56 Joseph [May he add] the son of Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], and Azarias, rulers of the host, heard of their exploits and of the war, what things they had done;
1MA 5:57 and they said, Let us also get us a name, and let us go fight against the Gentiles that are round about us.
1MA 5:58 And they gave charge to the men of the host that was with them, and went toward Jamnia.
1MA 5:59 And Gorgias and his men came out of the city to meet them in battle.
1MA 5:60 And Joseph [May he add] and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued to the borders of Judea [Praise]; and there fell on that day of the people of Israel [God prevails] about two thousand men.
1MA 5:61 And there was a great overthrow among the people, because they hearkened not to Judas [Praised] and his brethren, thinking to do some exploit.
1MA 5:62 But they were not of the seed of those men, by whose hand deliverance was given to Israel [God prevails].
1MA 5:63 And the man Judas [Praised] and his brethren were glorified exceedingly in the sight of all Israel [God prevails], and of all the Gentiles, wherever their name was heard of;
1MA 5:64 and men gathered together to them, acclaiming them.
1MA 5:65 And Judas [Praised] and his brethren went forth, and fought against the children of Esau [Hairy] in the land toward the south; and he struck Hebron and the villages thereof, and pulled down the strongholds thereof, and burned the towers thereof round about.
1MA 5:66 And he removed to go into the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)], and he went through Samaria.
1MA 5:67 In that day certain priests, desiring to do exploits there, were slain in battle, when as he went out to battle unadvisedly.
1MA 5:68 And Judas [Praised] turned aside to Azotus, to the land of the Philistines [To roll in dust (As an insult)], and pulled down their altars, and burned the carved images of their deities with fire, and took the spoil of their cities, and returned into the land of Judah [Praised].
1MA 6:1 And king Antiochus was journeying through the upper countries; and he heard say, that in Elymais in Persia [Descendants of Loving-kindness] there was a city renowned for riches, for silver and gold;
1MA 6:2 and that the temple which was in it was rich exceedingly, and that therein were golden shields, and breastplates, and arms, which Alexander, son of Philip [Loves horses], the Macedonian king, who reigned first among the Greeks, left behind there.
1MA 6:3 And he came and sought to take the city, and to pillage it; and he was not able, because the thing was known to them of the city,
1MA 6:4 and they rose up against him to battle: and he fled, and removed thence with great heaviness, to return to Babylon [Confusion].
1MA 6:5 And there came one bringing him tidings into Persia [Descendants of Loving-kindness], that the armies, which went against the land of Judah [Praised], had been put to flight;
1MA 6:6 and that Lysias went first with a strong host, and was put to shame before them; and that they had waxed strong by reason of arms and power, and with store of spoils, which they took from the armies that they had cut off;
1MA 6:7 and that they had pulled down the abomination which he had built upon the altar (of burnt offerings) that was in Jerusalem [City of peace]; and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and Bethsura, his city.
1MA 6:8 And it came to pass, when the king heard these words, he was astonished and moved exceedingly: and he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for.
1MA 6:9 And he was there many days, because great grief was renewed upon him, and he made account that he should die.
1MA 6:10 And he called for all his Friends, and said to them, Sleep departs from mine eyes, and my heart fails for care.
1MA 6:11 And I said in my heart, To what tribulation am I come, and how great a flood is it, wherein I now am! for I was gracious and beloved in my power.
1MA 6:12 But now I remember the evils which I did at Jerusalem [City of peace], and that I took all the utensils of silver and gold that were therein, and sent forth to destroy the inhabitants of Judah [Praised] without a cause.
1MA 6:13 I perceive that on this account these evils are come upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in a strange land.
1MA 6:14 And he called for Philip [Loves horses], one of his Friends, and set him over all his kingdom,
1MA 6:15 and gave him his diadem ·crown·, and his robe, and his signet ring, to the end he should bring Antiochus his son, and nourish him up that he might be king.
1MA 6:16 And king Antiochus died there in the one hundred forty ninth year.
1MA 6:17 And Lysias knew that the king was dead, and he set up Antiochus his son to reign, whom he had nourished up being young, and he called his name Eupator.
1MA 6:18 And they that were in the fortress shut up Israel [God prevails] round about the sanctuary, and sought always their hurt, and the strengthening of the Gentiles.
1MA 6:19 And Judas [Praised] thought to destroy them, and called all the people together to besiege them.
1MA 6:20 And they were gathered together, and besieged them in the one hundred fiftieth year, and he made mounds to shoot from, and engines of war.
1MA 6:21 And there came forth some of them that were shut up, and there were joined to them certain ungodly men of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 6:22 And they went to the king, and said, How long will you not execute judgement, and avenge our brethren?
1MA 6:23 We were willing to serve your father, and to walk after his words, and to follow his commandments;
1MA 6:24 and for this cause the children of our people besieged the fortress, and were alienated from us; but as many of us as they could light on they killed, and spoiled our inheritances.
1MA 6:25 And not against us only did they stretch out their hand, but also against all their borders.
1MA 6:26 And, behold, they are encamped this day against the fortress at Jerusalem [City of peace], to take it: and the sanctuary and Bethsura have they fortified.
1MA 6:27 And if you are not beforehand with them quickly, they will do greater things than these, and you shall not be able to control them.
1MA 6:28 And when the king heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his Friends, even the rulers of his host, and them that were over the horse.
1MA 6:29 And there came to him from other kingdoms, and from isles of the sea, bands of hired soldiers.
1MA 6:30 And the number of his forces was one hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty two elephants trained for war.
1MA 6:31 And they went through Idumaea, and encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and made engines of war; and they of Bethsura came out, and burned them with fire, and fought valiantly.
1MA 6:32 And Judas [Praised] removed from the fortress, and encamped at Bethzacharias, over against the king’s camp.
1MA 6:33 And the king rose early in the morning, and removed his army at full speed along the road to Bethzacharias, and his forces made them ready to battle, and sounded with the trumpets.
1MA 6:34 And they showed the elephants the blood of grapes and mulberries, that they might prepare them for the battle.
1MA 6:35 And they divided the beasts among the heavy infantry armed with spears, and they set by each elephant a thousand men armed with coats of mail, and helmets of bronze on their heads; and for each beast were appointed five hundred chosen horsemen.
1MA 6:36 These were ready beforehand, wherever the beast was; and wherever the beast went, they went with him; they departed not from him.
1MA 6:37 And towers of wood were upon them, strong and covered, one upon each beast, girded fast upon him with cunning contrivances; and upon each beast were thirty two valiant men that fought upon them, beside his Indian
1MA 6:38 (and the residue of the horsemen he set on this side and that side at the two parts of the army), striking terror into the enemy, and protected by the heavy infantry armed with spears.
1MA 6:39 Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and bronze, the mountains shone therewith, and blazed like torches of fire.
1MA 6:40 And a part of the king’s army was spread upon the high mountains, and some on the low ground, and they went on firmly and in order.
1MA 6:41 And all that heard the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the multitude, and the rattling of the arms, did quake: for the army was exceeding great and strong.
1MA 6:42 And Judas [Praised] and his army drew near for battle, and there fell of the king’s army six hundred men.
1MA 6:43 And Eleazar [Help of God], who was called Avaran, saw one of the beasts armed with royal breastplates, and he was higher than all the beasts, and the king seemed to be upon him;
1MA 6:44 and he gave himself to deliver his people, and to get him an everlasting name;
1MA 6:45 and he ran upon him courageously into the midst of the heavy infantry armed with spears, and killed on the right hand and on the left, and they parted asunder from him on this side and on that.
1MA 6:46 And he crept under the elephant, and thrust him from beneath, and killed him; and the elephant fell to the earth upon him, and he died there.
1MA 6:47 And they saw the strength of the kingdom, and the fierce onset of the hosts, and turned away from them.
1MA 6:48 But they of the king’s army went up to Jerusalem [City of peace] to meet them, and the king encamped toward Judea [Praise], and toward mount Sion.
1MA 6:49 And he made peace with them of Bethsura; and he came out of the city, because they had no food there to endure the siege, because it was a Sabbath ·To cease· to the land.
1MA 6:50 And the king took Bethsura, and appointed a garrison there to keep it.
1MA 6:51 And he encamped against the sanctuary many days; and set there mounds to shoot from, and engines of war, and instruments for casting fire and stones, and pieces to cast darts, and slings.
1MA 6:52 And they also made engines against their engines, and fought for many days.
1MA 6:53 But there were no food in the sanctuary, because it was the seventh year, and they that fled for safety into Judea [Praise] from among the Gentiles had eaten up the residue of the store;
1MA 6:54 and there were but a few left in the sanctuary, because the famine prevailed against them, and they were scattered, each man to his own place.
1MA 6:55 And Lysias heard say, that Philip [Loves horses], whom Antiochus the king, whiles he was yet alive, appointed to nourish up his son Antiochus, that he might be king,
1MA 6:56 was returned from Persia [Descendants of Loving-kindness] and Media [Middle-land], and with him the forces that went with the king, and that he was seeking to take to him the government.
1MA 6:57 And he made haste, and gave consent to depart; and he said to the king and the leaders of the host and to the men, We decay daily, and our food is scant, and the place where we encamp is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us:
1MA 6:58 now therefore let us give the right hand to these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation,
1MA 6:59 and covenant with them, that they shall walk after their own laws, as aforetime: for because of their laws which we abolished they were angered, and did all these things.
1MA 6:60 And the saying pleased the king and the princes, and he sent to them to make peace; and they accepted thereof.
1MA 6:61 And the king and the princes swore to them: thereupon they came forth from the stronghold.
1MA 6:62 And the king entered into mount Sion; and he saw the strength of the place, and set at nothing the oath which he had sworn, and gave commandment to pull down the wall round about.
1MA 6:63 And he removed in haste, and returned to Antioch, and found Philip [Loves horses] master of the city; and he fought against him, and took the city by force.
1MA 7:1 In the one hundred fifty first year Demetrius the son of Seleucus came forth from Rome [Town of flowing waters], and went up with a few men to a city by the sea, and reigned there.
1MA 7:2 And it came to pass, when he would go into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, that the army laid hands on Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them to him.
1MA 7:3 And the thing was known to him, and he said, show me not their faces.
1MA 7:4 And the army killed them. And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom.
1MA 7:5 And there came to him all those departing from Torah ·Teaching· and ungodly men of Israel [God prevails]; and Alcimus was their leader, desiring to be Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·;
1MA 7:6 and they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas [Praised] and his brethren have destroyed all your friends, and have scattered us from our own land.
1MA 7:7 Now therefore send a man whom you trust, and let him go and see all the havoc which he has made of us, and of the king’s country, and how he has punished them and all that helped them.
1MA 7:8 And the king chose Bacchides, one of the king’s Friends, who was ruler in the country beyond the river, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king.
1MA 7:9 And he sent him, and that ungodly Alcimus, and made sure to him the role of Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and he commanded him to take vengeance upon the children of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 7:10 And they removed, and came with a great host into the land of Judah [Praised], and he sent messengers to Judas [Praised] and his brethren with words of peace deceitfully.
1MA 7:11 And they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were come with a great host.
1MA 7:12 And there were gathered together to Alcimus and Bacchides a company of Torah-Teachers, to seek for justice.
1MA 7:13 And the Chasidim [Pious Ones] were the first among the children of Israel [God prevails] that sought peace of them;
1MA 7:14 for they said, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron [Light-bringer] is come with the forces, and he will do us no wrong.
1MA 7:15 And he spoke with them words of peace, and swore to them, saying, We will seek the hurt neither of you nor your friends.
1MA 7:16 And they gave him credence: and he laid hands on sixtieth men of them, and killed them in one day, according to the word which the psalmist wrote,
1MA 7:17 The flesh of your saints did they cast out, And their blood did they shed round about Jerusalem [City of peace]; And there was no man to bury them.
1MA 7:18 And the fear and the dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, There is neither truth nor judgement in them; for they have broken the covenant and the oath which they swore.
1MA 7:19 And Bacchides removed from Jerusalem [City of peace], and encamped in Bezeth; and he sent and took away many of the deserters that were with him, and certain of the people, and he killed them, and cast them into the great pit.
1MA 7:20 And he made sure the country to Alcimus, and left with him a force to aid him; and Bacchides went away to the king.
1MA 7:21 And Alcimus strove for his role of Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·.
1MA 7:22 And there were gathered to him all they that troubled their people, and they got the mastery of the land of Judah [Praised], and did great hurt in Israel [God prevails].
1MA 7:23 And Judas [Praised] saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done among the children of Israel [God prevails], even above the Gentiles,
1MA 7:24 and he went out into all the coasts of Judea [Praise] round about, and took vengeance on the men that had deserted from him, and they were restrained from going forth into the country.
1MA 7:25 But when Alcimus saw that Judas [Praised] and his company waxed strong, and knew that he was not able to withstand them, he returned to the king, and brought evil accusations against them.
1MA 7:26 And the king sent Nicanor, one of his honorable princes, a man that hated Israel [God prevails] and was their enemy, and commanded him to destroy the people.
1MA 7:27 And Nicanor came to Jerusalem [City of peace] with a great host; and he sent to Judas [Praised] and his brethren deceitfully with words of peace, saying,
1MA 7:28 Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see your faces in peace.
1MA 7:29 And he came to Judas [Praised], and they saluted one another peaceably. And the enemies were ready to take away Judas [Praised] by violence.
1MA 7:30 And the thing was known to Judas [Praised], namely, that he came to him with deceit, and he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no more.
1MA 7:31 And Nicanor knew that his counsel was discovered; and he went out to meet Judas [Praised] in battle beside Capharsalama;
1MA 7:32 and there fell of Nicanor’s side about five hundred men, and they fled into the city of David [Beloved].
1MA 7:33 And after these things Nicanor went up to mount Sion: and there came some of the priests out of the sanctuary, and some of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to show him the whole burned sacrifice that was being offered for the king.
1MA 7:34 And he mocked them, and laughed at them, and entreated them shamefully, and spoke haughtily,
1MA 7:35 and swore in a rage, saying, Unless Judas [Praised] and his army be now delivered into my hands, it shall be that, if I come again in peace, I will burn up this house: and he went out in a great rage.
1MA 7:36 And the priests entered in, and stood before the altar (of burnt offerings) and the temple; and they wept, and said,
1MA 7:37 You did choose this house to be called by your name, to be a house of prayer and supplication for your people:
1MA 7:38 take vengeance on this man and his army, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to live any longer.
1MA 7:39 And Nicanor went forth from Jerusalem [City of peace], and encamped in Bethhoron, and there met him the host of Syria [Elevated].
1MA 7:40 And Judas [Praised] encamped in Adasa with three thousand men: and Judas [Praised] prayed and said,
1MA 7:41 When they that came from the king blasphemed, your angel went out, and struck among them one hundred and eighty five thousand.
1MA 7:42 Even so embarrass you this army before us today, and let all the rest know that he has spoken wickedly against your sanctuary, and judge you him according to his wickedness.
1MA 7:43 And on the thirteenth day of the twelth month Adar ·Strength, 12· the armies joined battle: and Nicanor’s army was embarrassed, and he himself was the first to fall in the battle.
1MA 7:44 Now when his army saw that Nicanor was fallen, they cast away their arms, and fled.
1MA 7:45 And they pursued after them a day’s journey from Adasa until you come to Gazara, and they sounded an alarm after them with the solemn trumpets.
1MA 7:46 And they came forth out of all the villages of Judea [Praise] round about, and closed them in; and these turned them back on those, and they all fell by the sword, and there was not one of them left.
1MA 7:47 And they took the spoils, and the booty, and they struck off Nicanor’s head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so haughtily, and brought them, and stretched them out beside Jerusalem [City of peace].
1MA 7:48 And the people were exceeding glad, and they kept that day as a day of great gladness.
1MA 7:49 And they ordained to keep this day year by year on the thirteenth day of the twelth month Adar ·Strength, 12·.
1MA 7:50 And the land of Judah [Praised] had rest a little while.
1MA 8:1 And Judas [Praised] heard of the fame of the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters], that they are valiant men, and have pleasure in all that join themselves to them, and make amity with all such as come to them,
1MA 8:2 and that they are valiant men. And they told him of their wars and exploits which they do among the Gauls, and how that they conquered them, and brought them under tribute;
1MA 8:3 and what things they did in the land of Spain, that they might become masters of the mines of silver and gold which were there;
1MA 8:4 and how that by their policy and persistence they conquered all the place (and the place was exceeding far from them), and the kings that came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, until they had embarrassed them, and struck them very sore; and how the rest give them tribute year by year:
1MA 8:5 and Philip [Loves horses], and Perseus, king of Chittim, and them that lifted up themselves against them, did they embarrass in battle, and conquered them:
1MA 8:6 Antiochus also, the great king of Asia, who came against them to battle, having one hundred twenty elephants, with horse, and chariots, and an exceeding great host, and he was embarrassed by them,
1MA 8:7 and they took him alive, and appointed that both he and such as reigned after him should give them a great tribute, and should give hostages, and a parcel of land, namely,
1MA 8:8 the country of India, and Media [Middle-land], and Lydia, and of the goodliest of their countries; and they took them from him, and gave them to king Eumenes:
1MA 8:9 and how they of Greece took counsel to come and destroy them;
1MA 8:10 and the thing was known to them, and they sent against them a captain, and fought against them, and many of them fell down wounded to death, and they made captive their wives and their children, and spoiled them, and conquered their land, and pulled down their strongholds, and spoiled them, and brought them into bondage to this day:
1MA 8:11 and the residue of the kingdoms and of the isles, as many as rose up against them at any time, they destroyed and made them to be their servants;
1MA 8:12 but with their friends and such as relied upon them they kept amity; and they conquered the kingdoms that were near and those that were far off, and all that heard of their fame were afraid of them:
1MA 8:13 moreover, whoever they will to succor and to make kings, these do they make kings; and whoever they will, do they depose; and they are exalted exceedingly:
1MA 8:14 and for all this none of them did ever put on a diadem ·crown·, neither did they clothe themselves with purple, to be magnified thereby:
1MA 8:15 and how they had made for themselves a senate house, and day by day three hundred and twenty men sat in council, consulting always for the people, to the end they might be well ordered:
1MA 8:16 and how they commit their government to one man year by year, that he should rule over them, and be lord over all their country, and all are obedient to that one, and there is neither envy nor emulation among them.
1MA 8:17 And Judas [Praised] chose Eupolemus the son of John [Yah is gracious], the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar [Help of God], and sent them to Rome [Town of flowing waters], to make a league of amity and confederacy with them,
1MA 8:18 and that they should take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of the Greeks did keep Israel [God prevails] in bondage.
1MA 8:19 And they went to Rome [Town of flowing waters] (and the way was exceeding long), and they entered into the senate house, and answered and said,
1MA 8:20 Judas [Praised], who is also called Maccabaeus [Hammer], and his brethren, and the people of the Jews [Praisers], have sent us to you, to make a confederacy and peace with you, and that we might be registered your confederates and friends.
1MA 8:21 And the thing was well-pleasing in their sight.
1MA 8:22 And this is the copy of the writing which they wrote back again on tablets of bronze, and sent to Jerusalem [City of peace], that it might be with them there for a memorial of peace and confederacy:
1MA 8:23 Good success be to the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters], and to the nation of the Jews [Praisers], by sea and by land forever: the sword also and the enemy be far from them.
1MA 8:24 But if war arise for Rome [Town of flowing waters] first, or any of their confederates in all their dominion,
1MA 8:25 the nation of the Jews [Praisers] shall help them as confederates, as the occasion shall prescribe to them, with all their heart:
1MA 8:26 and to them that make war upon them they shall not give, neither supply, food, arms, money, or ships, as it has seemed good to Rome [Town of flowing waters], and they shall keep their ordinances without taking anything therefore.
1MA 8:27 In the same manner, moreover, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews [Praisers], the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters] shall help them as confederates with all their soul, as the occasion shall prescribe to them:
1MA 8:28 and to them that are confederates with their foes there shall not be given food, arms, money, or ships, as it has seemed good to Rome [Town of flowing waters]; and they shall keep these ordinances, and that without deceit.
1MA 8:29 According to these words have the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters] made a covenant thus with the people of the Jews [Praisers].
1MA 8:30 But if hereafter the one party and the other shall take counsel to add or diminish anything, they shall do it at their pleasure, and whatever they shall add or take away shall be established.
1MA 8:31 And as touching the evils which king Demetrius does to them, we have written to him, saying, Wherefore have you made your yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the Jews [Praisers]?
1MA 8:32 If therefore they plead any more against you, we will do them justice, and fight with you by sea and by land.
1MA 9:1 And Demetrius heard that Nicanor was fallen with his forces in battle, and he sent Bacchides and Alcimus again into the land of Judah [Praised] a second time, and the right wing of his army with them:
1MA 9:2 and they went by the way that leads to Gilgal, and encamped against Mesaloth, which is in Arbela, and got possession of it, and destroyed much people.
1MA 9:3 And the first month Nissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1· of the one hundred fifty second year they encamped against Jerusalem [City of peace]:
1MA 9:4 and they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horse.
1MA 9:5 And Judas [Praised] was encamped at Elasa, and three thousand chosen men with him:
1MA 9:6 and they saw the multitude of the forces, that they were many, and they feared exceedingly: and many slipped away out of the army; there were not left of them more than eight hundred men.
1MA 9:7 And Judas [Praised] saw that his army slipped away, and that the battle pressed upon him, and he was sore troubled in heart, for that he had no time to gather them together, and he waxed faint.
1MA 9:8 And he said to them that were left, Let us arise and go up against our adversaries, if perhaps we may be able to fight with them.
1MA 9:9 And they would have dissuaded him, saying, We shall in no wise be able: but let us rather save our lives now: let us return again, we and our brethren, and fight against them: but we are few.
1MA 9:10 And Judas [Praised] said, let it not be so that I should do this thing, to flee from them: and if our time is come, let us die manfully for our brethren’s sake, and not leave a cause of reproach against our glory.
1MA 9:11 And the host removed from the camp, and stood to encounter them, and the horse was parted into two companies, and the slingers and the archers went before the host, and all the mighty men that fought in the front of the battle.
1MA 9:12 But Bacchides was in the right wing; and the heavy infantry armed with spears drew near on the two parts, and they blew with their trumpets.
1MA 9:13 And the men of Judas [Praised]’ side, even they sounded with their trumpets, and the earth shook with the shout of the armies, and the battle was joined, and continued from morning until evening.
1MA 9:14 And Judas [Praised] saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, and there went with him all that were brave in heart,
1MA 9:15 and the right wing was embarrassed by them, and he pursued after them to the mount Azotus.
1MA 9:16 And they that were on the left wing saw that the right wing was embarrassed, and they turned and followed upon the footsteps of Judas [Praised] and of those that were with him:
1MA 9:17 and the battle waxed sore, and many on both parts fell wounded to death.
1MA 9:18 And Judas [Praised] fell, and the rest fled.
1MA 9:19 And Jonathan [Yah has given] and Simeon [Hearing] took Judas [Praised] their brother, and buried him in the sepulcher of his fathers at Modin.
1MA 9:20 And they bewailed him, and all Israel [God prevails] made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, and said,
1MA 9:21 How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel [God prevails]!
1MA 9:22 And the rest of the acts of Judas [Praised], and his wars, and the valiant deeds which he did, and his greatness, they are not written; for they were exceeding many.
1MA 9:23 And it came to pass after the death of Judas [Praised], that those departing from Torah ·Teaching· put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel [God prevails], and all they that wrought iniquity rose up
1MA 9:24 (in those days there was an exceeding great famine), and the country went over with them.
1MA 9:25 And Bacchides chose out the ungodly men, and made them lords of the country.
1MA 9:26 And they sought out and searched for the friends of Judas [Praised], and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance on them, and used them despitefully.
1MA 9:27 And there was great tribulation in Israel [God prevails], such as was not since the time that no prophet appeared to them.
1MA 9:28 And all the friends of Judas [Praised] were gathered together, and they said to Jonathan [Yah has given],
1MA 9:29 Since your brother Judas [Praised] has died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies and Bacchides, and among them of our nation that hate us.
1MA 9:30 Now therefore we have chosen you this day to be our prince and leader in his stead, that you may fight our battles.
1MA 9:31 And Jonathan [Yah has given] took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up in the stead of his brother Judas [Praised].
1MA 9:32 And Bacchides knew it, and he sought to kill him.
1MA 9:33 And Jonathan [Yah has given], and Simeon [Hearing] his brother, and all that were with him, knew it; and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoah, and encamped by the water of the pool Asphar.
1MA 9:34 And Bacchides knew it on the Sabbath ·To cease· day, and came, he and all his army, over Jordan [Descender].
1MA 9:35 And Jonathan [Yah has given] sent his brother, a leader of the multitude, and implored his friends the Nabathaeans, that they might leave with them their baggage, which was much.
1MA 9:36 And the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John [Yah is gracious], and all that he had, and went their way with it.
1MA 9:37 But after these things they brought word to Jonathan [Yah has given] and Simeon [Hearing] his brother, that the children of Jambri were making a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabath with a great train, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan [Humbled].
1MA 9:38 And they remembered John [Yah is gracious] their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the cover of the mountain:
1MA 9:39 and they lifted up their eyes, and saw, and, behold, a great fuss and much baggage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and his brethren, to meet them with timbrels, and minstrels, and many weapons.
1MA 9:40 And they rose up against them from their ambush, and killed them, and many fell wounded to death, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.
1MA 9:41 And the marriage was turned into mourning, and the voice of their minstrels into lamentation.
1MA 9:42 And they avenged fully the blood of their brother, and turned back to the marsh of Jordan [Descender].
1MA 9:43 And Bacchides heard it, and he came on the Sabbath ·To cease· day to the banks of Jordan [Descender] with a great host.
1MA 9:44 And Jonathan [Yah has given] said to his company, Let us stand up now and fight for our lives, for it is not with us today, as yesterday and the day before.
1MA 9:45 For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us; moreover the water of the Jordan [Descender] is on this side and on that side, and marsh and wood; and there is no place to turn aside.
1MA 9:46 Now therefore cry to heaven (God), that you may be delivered out of the hand of your enemies.
1MA 9:47 And the battle was joined, and Jonathan [Yah has given] stretched forth his hand to strike Bacchides, and he turned away back from him.
1MA 9:48 And Jonathan [Yah has given] and they that were with him leapt into the Jordan [Descender], and swam over to the other side: and they did not pass over Jordan [Descender] against them.
1MA 9:49 And there fell of Bacchides’ company that day about a thousand men;
1MA 9:50 and he returned to Jerusalem [City of peace]. And they built strong cities in Judea [Praise], the stronghold that was in Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Beth-el [House of God], and Timnath, Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and bars.
1MA 9:51 And in them he set a garrison, to vex Israel [God prevails].
1MA 9:52 And he fortified the city Bethsura, and Gazara, and the fortress, and put forces in them, and store of food.
1MA 9:53 And he took the sons of the chief men of the country for hostages, and put them in ward in the fortress at Jerusalem [City of peace].
1MA 9:54 And in the one hundred fifty third year, in the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·), Alcimus commanded to pull down the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary; he pulled down also the works of the prophets;
1MA 9:55 and he began to pull down. At that time was Alcimus stricken, and his works were hindered; and his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, and he could no more speak anything and give order concerning his house.
1MA 9:56 And Alcimus died at that time with great torment.
1MA 9:57 And Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, and he returned to the king: and the land of Judah [Praised] had rest two years.
1MA 9:58 And all those men departing from Torah ·Teaching· took counsel, saying, Behold, Jonathan [Yah has given] and they of his part are dwelling at ease, and in security: now therefore we will bring Bacchides, and he shall lay hands on them all in one night.
1MA 9:59 And they went and consulted with him.
1MA 9:60 And he removed, and came with a great host, and sent letters privily to all his confederates that were in Judea [Praise], that they should lay hands on Jonathan [Yah has given] and those that were with him: and they could not, because their counsel was known to them.
1MA 9:61 And they that were of Jonathan [Yah has given]’s part laid hands on about fifty of the men of the country, that were authors of the wickedness, and he killed them.
1MA 9:62 And Jonathan [Yah has given], and Simeon [Hearing], and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and he built up that which had been pulled down thereof, and they made it strong.
1MA 9:63 And Bacchides knew it, and he gathered together all his multitude, and sent word to them that were of Judea [Praise].
1MA 9:64 And he went and encamped against Bethbasi, and fought against it many days, and made engines of war.
1MA 9:65 And Jonathan [Yah has given] left his brother Simeon [Hearing] in the city, and went forth into the country, and he went with a few men.
1MA 9:66 And he struck Odomera and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.
1MA 9:67 And they began to strike them, and to go up with their forces. And Simeon [Hearing] and they that were with him went out of the city, and set on fire the engines of war,
1MA 9:68 and fought against Bacchides, and he was embarrassed by them, and they afflicted him sore; for his counsel was in vain, and his inroad.
1MA 9:69 And they were very angry with those men departing from Torah ·Teaching· that gave him counsel to come into the country, and they killed many of them. And he took counsel to depart into his own land.
1MA 9:70 And Jonathan [Yah has given] had knowledge thereof, and sent ambassadors to him, to the end that they should make peace with him, and that he should restore to them the captives.
1MA 9:71 And he accepted the thing, and did according to his words, and swore to him that he would not seek his hurt all the days of his life.
1MA 9:72 And he restored to him the captives which he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judah [Praised], and he returned and departed into his own land, and came not any more into their borders.
1MA 9:73 And the sword ceased from Israel [God prevails]. And Jonathan [Yah has given] lived at Michmash; and Jonathan [Yah has given] began to judge the people; and he destroyed the ungodly out of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 10:1 And in the one hundred sixtieth year Alexander Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus, went up and took possession of Ptolemais: and they received him, and he reigned there.
1MA 10:2 And king Demetrius heard thereof, and he gathered together exceeding great forces, and went forth to meet him in battle.
1MA 10:3 And Demetrius sent letters to Jonathan [Yah has given] with words of peace, so as to magnify him.
1MA 10:4 For he said, let us be beforehand to make peace with them, ere he make peace with Alexander against us:
1MA 10:5 for he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and to his brethren and to his nation.
1MA 10:6 And he gave him authority to gather together forces, and to provide arms, and that he should be his confederate: and he commanded that they should deliver up to him the hostages that were in the fortress.
1MA 10:7 And Jonathan [Yah has given] came to Jerusalem [City of peace], and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of them that were in the fortress:
1MA 10:8 and they were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together a host.
1MA 10:9 And they of the fortress delivered up the hostages to Jonathan [Yah has given], and he restored them to their parents.
1MA 10:10 And Jonathan [Yah has given] lived in Jerusalem [City of peace], and began to build and renew the city.
1MA 10:11 And he commanded them that did the work to build the walls and the mount Sion round about with square stones for defense; and they did so.
1MA 10:12 And the strangers, that were in the strongholds which Bacchides had built, fled away;
1MA 10:13 and each man left his place, and departed into his own land.
1MA 10:14 Only at Bethsura were there left certain of those that had forsaken Torah ·Teaching· and the commandments; for it was a place of refuge to them.
1MA 10:15 And king Alexander heard all the promises which Demetrius had sent to Jonathan [Yah has given]: and they told him of the battles and the valiant deeds which he and his brethren had done, and of the toils which they had endured;
1MA 10:16 And he said, Shall we find such another man? and now we will make him our Friend and confederate.
1MA 10:17 And he wrote letters, and sent them to him, according to these words, saying,
1MA 10:18 King Alexander to his brother Jonathan [Yah has given], greeting:
1MA 10:19 We have heard of you, that you are a mighty man of valor, and meet to be our Friend.
1MA 10:20 And now we have appointed you this day to be Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· of your nation, and to be called the king’s Friend (and he sent to him a purple robe and a crown of gold), and to take our part, and to keep friendship with us.
1MA 10:21 And Jonathan [Yah has given] put on the holy garments in the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· of the one hundred sixtieth year, at the festival of tabernacles, and he gathered together forces, and provided arms in abundance.
1MA 10:22 And Demetrius heard these things, and he was grieved, and said,
1MA 10:23 What is this that we have done, that Alexander has been beforehand with us in establishing friendship with the Jews [Praisers], to strengthen himself?
1MA 10:24 I also will write to them words of encouragement and of honor and of gifts, that they may be with me to aid me.
1MA 10:25 And he sent to them according to these words: King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews [Praisers], greeting:
1MA 10:26 In as much as you have kept your covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, and have not joined yourselves to our enemies, we have heard hereof, and are glad.
1MA 10:27 And now continue you still to keep trusting faith with us, and we will recompense to you good things in return for your dealings with us,
1MA 10:28 and will grant you many immunities, and give you gifts.
1MA 10:29 And now do I free you, and release all the Jews [Praisers], from the tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from the crowns.
1MA 10:30 And instead of the third part of the seed, and instead of the half of the fruit of the trees, which falls to me to receive, I release it from this day and henceforth, so that I will not take it from the land of Judah [Praised], and from the three governments which are added there from the country of Samaria and Galilee [District, Circuit], from this day forth and for all time.
1MA 10:31 And let Jerusalem [City of peace] be holy and free, and her borders; the tenths and the tolls also.
1MA 10:32 I yield up also my authority over the fortress which is at Jerusalem [City of peace], and give it to the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, that he may appoint in it such men as he shall choose to keep it.
1MA 10:33 And every soul of the Jews [Praisers], that has been carried captive from the land of Judah [Praised] into any part of my kingdom, I set at liberty without price; and let all remit the tributes of their cattle also.
1MA 10:34 And all the feasts, and the Shabbatot ·To cease·, and new moons, and appointed days, and three days before a feast, and three days after a feast, let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews [Praisers] that are in my kingdom.
1MA 10:35 And no man shall have authority to exact from any of them, or to trouble them concerning any matter.
1MA 10:36 And let there be enrolled among the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews [Praisers], and pay shall be given to them, as belongs to all the king’s forces.
1MA 10:37 And of them some shall be placed in the king’s great strongholds, and some of them shall be placed over the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and let those that are over them, and their rulers, be of themselves, and let them walk after their own laws, even as the king has commanded in the land of Judah [Praised].
1MA 10:38 And the three governments that have been added to Judea [Praise] from the country of Samaria, let them be added to Judea [Praise], that they may be reckoned to be under one, that they may not obey other authority than the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·’s.
1MA 10:39 As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining there, I have given it as a gift to the sanctuary that is at Jerusalem [City of peace], for the expenses that befit the sanctuary.
1MA 10:40 And I give every year fifteen thousand shekels [375 lb; 170.1 kg] of silver from the king’s revenues from the places that are convenient.
1MA 10:41 And all the overplus, which they that manage the king’s affairs paid not in as in the first years, they shall give from henceforth toward the works of the house.
1MA 10:42 And beside this, the five thousand shekels [125 lb; 56.7 kg] of silver, which they received from the uses of the sanctuary from the revenue year by year, this also is released, because it appertains to the priests that minister.
1MA 10:43 And whoever shall flee to the temple that is at Jerusalem [City of peace], and be found within all the borders thereof, whether one owe moneys to the king, or any other matter, let them go free, and all that they have in my kingdom.
1MA 10:44 And for the building and renewing of the works of the sanctuary the expense shall be given also out of the king’s revenue.
1MA 10:45 And for the building of the walls of Jerusalem [City of peace], and the fortifying thereof round about, shall the expense be given also out of the king’s revenue, and for the building of the walls in Judea [Praise].
1MA 10:46 Now when Jonathan [Yah has given] and the people heard these words, they gave no credence to them, nor received them, because they remembered the great evil which he had done in Israel [God prevails], and that he had afflicted them very sore.
1MA 10:47 And they were well pleased with Alexander, because he was the first that spoke words of peace to them, and they were confederate with him always.
1MA 10:48 And king Alexander gathered together great forces, and encamped over against Demetrius.
1MA 10:49 And the two kings joined battle, and the army of Alexander fled; and Demetrius followed after him, and prevailed against them.
1MA 10:50 And he strengthened the battle exceedingly until the sun went down: and Demetrius fell that day.
1MA 10:51 And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] according to these words, saying,
1MA 10:52 In as much as I am returned to my kingdom, and am set on the throne of my fathers, and have gotten the dominion, and have overthrown Demetrius, and have gotten possession of our country;
1MA 10:53 yes, I joined the battle with him, and he and his army were embarrassed by us, and we sat upon the throne of his kingdom:
1MA 10:54 now also let us establish amity one with the other, and give me now your daughter to wife: and I will make affinity with you, and will give both you and her gifts worthy of you.
1MA 10:55 And Ptolemy the king answered, saying, Happy is the day wherein you did return into the land of your fathers, and did sit on the throne of their kingdom.
1MA 10:56 And now will I do to you, as you have written: but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; and I will make affinity with you, even as you have said.
1MA 10:57 And Ptolemy went out of Egypt [Abode of slavery], himself and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in the one hundred sixty second year:
1MA 10:58 and king Alexander met him, and he bestowed on him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great pomp, as the manner of kings is.
1MA 10:59 And king Alexander wrote to Jonathan [Yah has given], that he should come to meet him.
1MA 10:60 And he went with pomp to Ptolemais, and met the two kings, and gave them and their Friends silver and gold, and many gifts, and found favor in their sight.
1MA 10:61 And there were gathered together against him certain pestilent fellows out of Israel [God prevails], men that were transgressors of Torah ·Teaching·, to complain against him: and the king gave no heed to them.
1MA 10:62 And the king commanded, and they took off Jonathan [Yah has given]’s garments, and clothed him in purple: and thus they did.
1MA 10:63 And the king made him sit with him, and said to his princes, Go forth with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and let no man trouble him for any manner of cause.
1MA 10:64 And it came to pass, when they that complained against him saw his glory according as the herald made proclamation, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled away.
1MA 10:65 And the king gave him honor, and wrote him among his Chief Friends, and made him a captain, and governor of a province.
1MA 10:66 And Jonathan [Yah has given] returned to Jerusalem [City of peace] with peace and gladness.
1MA 10:67 And in the one hundred sixty fifth year came Demetrius, son of Demetrius, out of Crete into the land of his fathers:
1MA 10:68 and king Alexander heard thereof, and he grieved exceedingly, and returned to Antioch.
1MA 10:69 And Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was over Coelesyria, and he gathered together a great host, and encamped in Jamnia, and sent to Jonathan [Yah has given] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, saying,
1MA 10:70 You alone lift up yourself against us, but I am had in derision and in reproach because of you. And why do you vaunt your power against us in the mountains?
1MA 10:71 Now therefore, if you trust in your forces, come down to us into the plain, and there let us try the matter together; for with me is the power of the cities.
1MA 10:72 Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that help us; and they say, Your foot can’t stand before our face; for your fathers have been twice put to flight in their own land.
1MA 10:73 And now you shall not be able to abide the horse and such a host as this in the plain, where is neither stone nor flint, nor place to flee to.
1MA 10:74 Now when Jonathan [Yah has given] heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and he chose out ten thousand men, and went forth from Jerusalem [City of peace], and Simeon [Hearing] his brother met him for to help him.
1MA 10:75 And he encamped against Joppa: and they of the city shut him out, because Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa:
1MA 10:76 and they fought against it. And they of the city were afraid, and opened to him: and Jonathan [Yah has given] became master of Joppa.
1MA 10:77 And Apollonius heard, and he gathered an army of three thousand horse, and a great host, and went to Azotus as though he were on a journey, and there he drew onward into the plain, because he had a multitude of horse, and trusted therein.
1MA 10:78 And he pursued after him to Azotus, and the armies joined battle after him.
1MA 10:79 And Apollonius had left a thousand horse behind them privily.
1MA 10:80 And Jonathan [Yah has given] knew that there was an ambush behind him. And they compassed round his army, and cast their darts at the people, from morning until evening:
1MA 10:81 but the people stood still, as Jonathan [Yah has given] commanded them: and their horses were wearied.
1MA 10:82 And Simeon [Hearing] drew forth his host, and joined battle with the heavy infantry armed with spears (for the horsemen were spent), and they were embarrassed by him, and fled.
1MA 10:83 And the horsemen were scattered in the plain, and they fled to Azotus, and entered into Beth-dagon, their idol’s temple, to save themselves.
1MA 10:84 And Jonathan [Yah has given] burned Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, and them that fled into it, he burned with fire.
1MA 10:85 And they that had fallen by the sword, with them that were burned, were about eight thousand men.
1MA 10:86 And from thence Jonathan [Yah has given] removed, and encamped against Ascalon, and they of the city came forth to meet him with great pomp.
1MA 10:87 And Jonathan [Yah has given], with them that were on his side, returned to Jerusalem [City of peace], having many spoils.
1MA 10:88 And it came to pass, when king Alexander heard these things, he honored Jonathan [Yah has given] yet more;
1MA 10:89 and he sent to him a buckle of gold, as the use is to give to such as are of the kindred of the kings: and he gave him Ekron and all the coasts thereof for a possession.
1MA 11:1 And the king of Egypt [Abode of slavery] gathered together great forces, as the sand which is by the sea shore, and many ships, and sought to make himself master of Alexander’s kingdom by deceit, and to add it to his own kingdom.
1MA 11:2 And he went forth into Syria [Elevated] with words of peace, and they of the cities opened to him, and met him; For king Alexander’s commandment was that they should meet him, because he was his father in law.
1MA 11:3 Now as he entered into the cities of Ptolemais, he set his forces for a garrison in each city.
1MA 11:4 But when he came near to Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon burned with fire, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof pulled down, and the bodies cast abroad, and them that had been burned, whom he burned in the war, for they had made heaps of them in his way.
1MA 11:5 And they told the king what things Jonathan [Yah has given] had done, that they might cast blame on him: and the king held his peace.
1MA 11:6 And Jonathan [Yah has given] met the king with pomp at Joppa, and they saluted one another, and they slept there.
1MA 11:7 And Jonathan [Yah has given] went with the king as far as the river that is called Eleutherus, and returned to Jerusalem [City of peace].
1MA 11:8 But king Ptolemy became master of the cities upon the sea coast, to Selucia which is by the sea, and he devised evil devices concerning Alexander.
1MA 11:9 And he sent ambassadors to king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a covenant with one another, and I will give you my daughter whom Alexander has, and you shall reign over your father’s kingdom;
1MA 11:10 for I have made teshuvah ·complete repentance· that I gave my daughter to him, for he sought to kill me.
1MA 11:11 And he cast blame on him, because he coveted his kingdom.
1MA 11:12 And taking his daughter from him, he gave her to Demetrius, and was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity was openly seen.
1MA 11:13 And Ptolemy entered into Antioch, and put on himself the diadem ·crown· of Asia; and he put two diadems ·crowns· upon his head, the diadem ·crown· of Egypt [Abode of slavery] and that of Asia.
1MA 11:14 But king Alexander was in Cilicia at that season, because they of those parts were in revolt.
1MA 11:15 And Alexander heard of it, and he came against him in war: and Ptolemy led forth his host, and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight.
1MA 11:16 And Alexander fled into Arabia, that he might be sheltered there; but king Ptolemy was exalted.
1MA 11:17 And Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it to Ptolemy.
1MA 11:18 And king Ptolemy died the third day after, and they that were in his strongholds were slain by them that were in the strongholds.
1MA 11:19 And Demetrius reigned in the one hundred sixty seventh year.
1MA 11:20 In those days Jonathan [Yah has given] gathered together them of Judea [Praise], to take the fortress that was at Jerusalem [City of peace]: and he made many engines of war against it.
1MA 11:21 And certain that hated their own nation, men that transgressed Torah ·Teaching·, went to the king, and reported to him that Jonathan [Yah has given] was besieging the fortress.
1MA 11:22 And he heard, and was angered; but when he heard it, he set forth immediately, and came to Ptolemais, and wrote to Jonathan [Yah has given], that he should not besiege it, and that he should meet him and speak with him at Ptolemais with all speed.
1MA 11:23 But when Jonathan [Yah has given] heard this, he commanded to besiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel [God prevails] and of the priests, and put himself in peril,
1MA 11:24 and taking silver and gold and raiment and various presents besides, went to Ptolemais to the king. And he found favor in his sight.
1MA 11:25 And certain men departing from Torah ·Teaching· of them that were of the nation made complaints against him,
1MA 11:26 and the king did to him even as his predecessors had done to him, and exalted him in the sight of all his Friends,
1MA 11:27 and confirmed to him the role of Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and all the other honors that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his Chief Friends.
1MA 11:28 And Jonathan [Yah has given] requested of the king, that he would make Judea [Praise] free from tribute, and the three provinces, and the country of Samaria; and promised him three hundred talents [180,000 denarii; 155,250 lb; 7,020 kg].
1MA 11:29 And the king consented, and wrote letters to Jonathan [Yah has given] concerning all these things after this manner:
1MA 11:30 King Demetrius to his brother Jonathan [Yah has given], and to the nation of the Jews [Praisers], greeting:
1MA 11:31 The copy of the letter which we wrote to Lasthenes our kinsman concerning you, we have written also to you, that you may see it.
1MA 11:32 King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greeting:
1MA 11:33 We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews [Praisers], who are our friends, and observe what is just toward us, because of their good will toward us.
1MA 11:34 We have confirmed therefore to them the borders of Judea [Praise], and also the three governments of Aphaerema and Lydda and Ramathaim (these were added to Judea [Praise] from the country of Samaria), and all things appertaining to them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem [City of peace], instead of the king’s dues which the king received of them yearly aforetime from the produce of the earth and the fruits of trees.
1MA 11:35 And as for the other things that pertain to us from henceforth, of the tenths and the tolls that pertain to us, and the salt pits, and the crowns that pertain to us, all these we will bestow upon them.
1MA 11:36 And not one of these things shall be annulled from this time forth and forever.
1MA 11:37 Now therefore be careful to make a copy of these things, and let it be given to Jonathan [Yah has given], and let it be set up on the holy mount in a meet and conspicuous place.
1MA 11:38 And king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made to him, and he sent away all his forces, each man to his own place, except the foreign forces, which he had raised from the isles of the Gentiles: and all the forces of his fathers hated him.
1MA 11:39 Now Tryphon was of those who aforetime had been of Alexander’s part, and he saw that all the forces murmured against Demetrius, and he went to Imalcue the Arabian, who was nourishing up Antiochus the young child of Alexander,
1MA 11:40 and pressed sore upon him that he should deliver him to him, that he might reign in his father’s stead: and he told him all that Demetrius had done, and the hatred wherewith his forces hated him; and he abode there many days.
1MA 11:41 And Jonathan [Yah has given] sent to king Demetrius, that he should cast out of Jerusalem [City of peace] them of the fortress, and them that were in the strongholds; for they fought against Israel [God prevails] continually.
1MA 11:42 And Demetrius sent to Jonathan [Yah has given], saying, I will not only do this for you and your nation, but I will greatly honor you and your nation, if I find fair occasion.
1MA 11:43 Now therefore you shall do well, if you send me men who shall fight for me; for all my forces are revolted.
1MA 11:44 And Jonathan [Yah has given] sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch: and they came to the king, and the king was glad at their coming.
1MA 11:45 And they of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of one hundred and twenty thousand men, and they were minded to kill the king.
1MA 11:46 And the king fled into the court of the palace, and they of the city seized the passages of the city, and began to fight.
1MA 11:47 And the king called the Jews [Praisers] to help him, and they were gathered together to him all at once, and they dispersed themselves in the city, and killed that day to the number of one hundred thousand.
1MA 11:48 And they set the city on fire, and got many spoils that day, and saved the king.
1MA 11:49 And they of the city saw that the Jews [Praisers] had made themselves masters of the city as they would, and they waxed faint in their hearts, and they cried out to the king with supplication, saying,
1MA 11:50 Give us your right hand, and let the Jews [Praisers] cease from fighting against us and the city.
1MA 11:51 And they cast away their arms, and made peace; and the Jews [Praisers] were glorified in the sight of the king, and before all that were in his kingdom; and they returned to Jerusalem [City of peace], having many spoils.
1MA 11:52 And king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.
1MA 11:53 And he lied in all that he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan [Yah has given], and recompensed him not according to the benefits with which he had recompensed him, and afflicted him exceedingly.
1MA 11:54 Now after this Tryphon returned, and with him the young child Antiochus; and he reigned, and put on a diadem ·crown·.
1MA 11:55 And there were gathered to him all the forces which Demetrius had sent away with disgrace, and they fought against him, and he fled and was put to the rout.
1MA 11:56 And Tryphon took the elephants, and became master of Antioch.
1MA 11:57 And the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan [Yah has given], saying, I confirm to you the role of Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and appoint you over the four governments, and to be one of the king’s Friends.
1MA 11:58 And he sent to him golden utensils and furniture for the table of the show bread, and gave him leave to drink in golden utensils, and to be clothed in purple, and to have a golden buckle.
1MA 11:59 And his brother Simeon [Hearing] he made captain from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt [Abode of slavery].
1MA 11:60 And Jonathan [Yah has given] went forth, and took his journey beyond the river and through the cities; and all the forces of Syria [Elevated] gathered themselves to him for to be his confederates. And he came to Ascalon, and they of the city met him honorably.
1MA 11:61 And he departed thence to Gaza, and they of Gaza shut him out; and he laid siege to it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.
1MA 11:62 And they of Gaza made request to Jonathan [Yah has given], and he gave them his right hand, and took the sons of their princes for hostages, and sent them away to Jerusalem [City of peace]; and he passed through the country as far as Damascus [Bucket of blood].
1MA 11:63 And Jonathan [Yah has given] heard that Demetrius’ princes were come to Kedesh, which is in Galilee [District, Circuit], with a great host, purposing to remove him from his office;
1MA 11:64 and he went to meet them, but Simeon [Hearing] his brother he left in the country.
1MA 11:65 And Simeon [Hearing] encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and shut it up:
1MA 11:66 and they made request to him that he would give them his right hand, and he gave it to them; and he put them out from thence, and took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it.
1MA 11:67 And Jonathan [Yah has given] and his army encamped at the water of Gennesareth, and early in the morning they got them to the plain of Hazor.
1MA 11:68 And, behold, an army of strangers met him in the plain, and they laid an ambush for him in the mountains, but themselves met him face to face.
1MA 11:69 But they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined battle; and all they that were of Jonathan [Yah has given]’s side fled:
1MA 11:70 not one of them was left, except Mattathias [Gift of Yah] the son of Absalom, and Judas [Praised] the son of Chalphi, captains of the forces.
1MA 11:71 And Jonathan [Yah has given] tore his clothes, and put earth upon his head, and prayed.
1MA 11:72 And he turned again to them in battle, and put them to the rout, and they fled.
1MA 11:73 And they of his side that fled saw it, and returned to him, and pursued with him to Kedesh to their camp, and they encamped there.
1MA 11:74 And there fell of the strangers on that day about three thousand men: and Jonathan [Yah has given] returned to Jerusalem [City of peace].
1MA 12:1 And Jonathan [Yah has given] saw that the time served him, and he chose men, and sent them to Rome [Town of flowing waters], to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them.
1MA 12:2 And to the Spartans, and to other places, he sent letters after the same manner.
1MA 12:3 And they went to Rome [Town of flowing waters], and entered into the senate house, and said, Jonathan [Yah has given] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and the nation of the Jews [Praisers], have sent us, to renew for them the friendship and the confederacy, as in former time.
1MA 12:4 And they gave them letters to the men in every place, that they should bring them on their way to the land of Judah [Praised] in peace.
1MA 12:5 And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan [Yah has given] wrote to the Spartans:
1MA 12:6 Jonathan [Yah has given] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and the senate of the nation, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews [Praisers], to their brethren the Spartans, greeting:
1MA 12:7 Even before this time were letters sent to Onias the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· from Arius, who was reigning among you, to signify that you are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten shows.
1MA 12:8 And Onias entreated honorably the man that was sent, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of confederacy and friendship.
1MA 12:9 Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, having for our encouragement the holy books which are in our hands,
1MA 12:10 have assayed to send that we might renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, to the end that we should not become estranged from you altogether: for long time is passed since you sent to us.
1MA 12:11 We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and on the other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as it is right and meet to be mindful of brethren:
1MA 12:12 and moreover are glad for your glory.
1MA 12:13 But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encompassed us, and the kings that are round about us have fought against us.
1MA 12:14 We were not minded therefore to be troublesome to you, and to the rest of our confederates and friends, in these wars;
1MA 12:15 for we have the help which is from heaven (God) to help us, and we have been delivered from our enemies, and our enemies have been brought low.
1MA 12:16 We chose therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters], to renew the friendship that we had with them, and the former confederacy.
1MA 12:17 We commanded them therefore to go also to you, and to salute you, and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of friendship and our brotherhood.
1MA 12:18 And now you shall do well if you give us an answer there.
1MA 12:19 And this is the copy of the letters which they sent to Onias:
1MA 12:20 Arius king of the Spartans to Onias the chief priest, greeting:
1MA 12:21 It has been found in writing, concerning the Spartans and the Jews [Praisers], that they are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham [Father of a multitude]:
1MA 12:22 and now, since this is come to our knowledge, you shall do well to write to us of your peace and prosperity.
1MA 12:23 And we moreover do write on our part to you, that your cattle and goods are ours, and ours are yours. We do command therefore that they make report to you on this wise.
1MA 12:24 And Jonathan [Yah has given] heard that Demetrius’ princes were returned to fight against him with a greater host than before,
1MA 12:25 and he removed from Jerusalem [City of peace], and met them in the country of Hamath; for he gave them no respite to set foot in his country.
1MA 12:26 And he sent spies into his camp, and they came again, and reported to him that they were appointed in such and such a way to fall upon them in the night season.
1MA 12:27 But as soon as the sun was down, Jonathan [Yah has given] commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they might be ready for battle: and he put forth sentinels round about the camp.
1MA 12:28 And the adversaries heard that Jonathan [Yah has given] and his men were ready for battle, and they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp and departed.
1MA 12:29 But Jonathan [Yah has given] and his men knew it not till the morning; for they saw the lights burning.
1MA 12:30 And Jonathan [Yah has given] pursued after them, and overtook them not; for they were gone over the river Eleutherus.
1MA 12:31 And Jonathan [Yah has given] turned aside to the Arabians, who are called Zabadaeans, and struck them, and took their spoils.
1MA 12:32 And he came out from thence, and came to Damascus [Bucket of blood], and took his journey through all the country.
1MA 12:33 And Simeon [Hearing] went forth, and took his journey as far as Ascalon, and the strongholds that were near to it. And he turned aside to Joppa, and took possession of it;
1MA 12:34 for he had heard that they were minded to deliver the stronghold to the men of Demetrius; and he set a garrison there to keep it.
1MA 12:35 And Jonathan [Yah has given] returned, and called the elders of the people together; and he took counsel with them to build strongholds in Judea [Praise],
1MA 12:36 and to make the walls of Jerusalem [City of peace] higher, and to raise a great mound between the fortress and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be all alone, that men might neither buy nor sell.
1MA 12:37 And they were gathered together to build the city, and there fell down part of the wall of the brook that is on the east side, and he repaired that which is called Chaphenatha.
1MA 12:38 And Simeon [Hearing] also built Adida in the plain country, and made it strong, and set up gates and bars.
1MA 12:39 And Tryphon sought to reign over Asia and to put on himself the diadem ·crown·, and to stretch forth his hand against Antiochus the king.
1MA 12:40 And he was afraid lest haply Jonathan [Yah has given] should not suffer him, and lest he should fight against him; and he sought a way how to take him, that he might destroy him. And he removed, and came to Bethshan.
1MA 12:41 And Jonathan [Yah has given] came forth to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethshan.
1MA 12:42 And Tryphon saw that he came with a great host, and he was afraid to stretch forth his hand against him:
1MA 12:43 and he received him honorably, and commended him to all his Friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his forces to be obedient to him, as to himself.
1MA 12:44 And he said to Jonathan [Yah has given], Why have you put all this people to trouble, seeing there is no war between us?
1MA 12:45 And now send them away to their homes, but choose for yourself a few men who shall be with you, and come you with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it up to you, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest of the forces, and all the king’s officers: and I will return and depart; for this is the cause of my coming.
1MA 12:46 And he put his trust in him, and did even as he said, and sent away his forces, and they departed into the land of Judah [Praised].
1MA 12:47 But he reserved to himself three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee [District, Circuit], but one thousand went with him.
1MA 12:48 Now as soon as Jonathan [Yah has given] entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates, and laid hands on him; and all them that came in with him they killed with the sword.
1MA 12:49 And Tryphon sent forces and horsemen into Galilee [District, Circuit], and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan [Yah has given]’s men.
1MA 12:50 And they perceived that he was taken and had perished, and they that were with him; and they encouraged one another, and went on their way close together, prepared to fight.
1MA 12:51 And they that followed upon them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again.
1MA 12:52 And they all came in peace into the land of Judah [Praised], and they mourned for Jonathan [Yah has given], and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; and all Israel [God prevails] mourned with a great mourning.
1MA 12:53 And all the Gentiles that were round about them sought to destroy them utterly: for they said, They have no ruler, nor any to help them: now therefore let us fight against them, and take away their memorial from among men.
1MA 13:1 And Simeon [Hearing] heard that Tryphon had gathered together a mighty host to come into the land of Judah [Praised], and destroy it utterly.
1MA 13:2 And he saw that the people trembled and was in great fear; and he went up to Jerusalem [City of peace], and gathered the people together;
1MA 13:3 and he encouraged them, and said to them, You yourselves know all the things that I, and my brethren, and my father’s house, have done for the laws and the sanctuary, and the battles and the distresses which we have seen:
1MA 13:4 by reason hereof all my brethren have perished for Israel [God prevails]’s sake, and I am left alone.
1MA 13:5 And now be it far from me, that I should spare mine own life in any time of affliction; for I am not better than my brethren.
1MA 13:6 Howbeit I will take vengeance for my nation, and for the sanctuary, and for our wives and children; because all the Gentiles are gathered to destroy us of very hatred.
1MA 13:7 And the spirit of the people revived, as soon as they heard these words.
1MA 13:8 And they answered with a loud voice, saying, You are our leader instead of Judas [Praised] and Jonathan [Yah has given] your brother.
1MA 13:9 Fight you our battles, and all that you shall say to us, that will we do.
1MA 13:10 And he gathered together all the men of war, and made haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem [City of peace], and he fortified it round about.
1MA 13:11 And he sent Jonathan [Yah has given] the son of Absalom, and with him a great host, to Joppa: and he cast out them that were therein, and abode there in it.
1MA 13:12 And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a mighty host to enter into the land of Judah [Praised], and Jonathan [Yah has given] was with him in ward.
1MA 13:13 But Simeon [Hearing] encamped at Adida, over against the plain.
1MA 13:14 And Tryphon knew that Simeon [Hearing] was risen up instead of his brother Jonathan [Yah has given], and meant to join battle with him, and he sent ambassadors to him, saying,
1MA 13:15 It is for money which Jonathan [Yah has given] your brother owed to the king’s treasure, by reason of the offices which he had, that we hold him fast.
1MA 13:16 And now send one hundred talents [600,000 denarii; 51,750 lb; 2,340 kg] of silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will set him at liberty.
1MA 13:17 And Simeon [Hearing] knew that they spoke to him deceitfully; and he sends the money and the children, lest perhaps he should procure to himself great hatred of the people,
1MA 13:18 and they should say, Because I sent him not the money and the children, he perished.
1MA 13:19 And he sent the children and the one hundred talents [600,000 denarii; 51,750 lb; 2,340 kg]. And he dealt falsely, and did not set Jonathan [Yah has given] at liberty.
1MA 13:20 And after this Tryphon came to invade the land, and destroy it, and he went round about by the way that leads to Adora: and Simeon [Hearing] and his army marched over against him to every place, wherever he went.
1MA 13:21 Now they of the fortress sent to Tryphon ambassadors, hastening him to come to them through the wilderness, and to send them food.
1MA 13:22 And Tryphon made ready all his horse to come: and on that night there fell a very great snow, and he came not by reason of the snow. And he removed, and came into the country of Gilead.
1MA 13:23 But when he came near to Bascama, he killed Jonathan [Yah has given], and he was buried there.
1MA 13:24 And Tryphon returned, and went away into his own land.
1MA 13:25 And Simeon [Hearing] sent, and took the bones of Jonathan [Yah has given] his brother, and buried him at Modin, the city of his fathers.
1MA 13:26 And all Israel [God prevails] made great lamentation over him, and mourned for him many days.
1MA 13:27 And Simeon [Hearing] built a monument upon the sepulcher of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with polished stone behind and before.
1MA 13:28 And he set up seven pyramids, one over against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren.
1MA 13:29 And for these he made cunning devices, setting about them great pillars, and upon the pillars he fashioned all manner of arms for a perpetual memory, and beside the arms ships carved, that they should be seen of all that sail on the sea.
1MA 13:30 This is the sepulcher which he made at Modin, and it is there to this day.
1MA 13:31 Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus, and killed him,
1MA 13:32 and reigned in his stead, and put on himself the diadem ·crown· of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.
1MA 13:33 And Simeon [Hearing] built the strongholds of Judea [Praise], and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars; and he laid up food in the strongholds.
1MA 13:34 And Simeon [Hearing] chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should give the country an immunity, because all that Tryphon did was to plunder.
1MA 13:35 And king Demetrius sent to him according to these words, and answered him, and wrote a letter to him, after this manner:
1MA 13:36 King Demetrius to Simeon [Hearing] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· and Friend of kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews [Praisers], greeting:
1MA 13:37 The golden crown, and the palm branch, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a steadfast peace with you, yes, and to write to our officers, to grant immunities to you.
1MA 13:38 And whatever things we confirmed to you, they are confirmed; and the strongholds, which you have built, let them be your own.
1MA 13:39 As for any oversights and faults committed to this day, we forgive them, and the crown which you owed us: and if there were any other toll exacted in Jerusalem [City of peace], let it be exacted no longer.
1MA 13:40 And if there be any among you meet to be enrolled in our court, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.
1MA 13:41 In the one hundred seventieth year was the yoke of the heathen taken away from Israel [God prevails].
1MA 13:42 And the people began to write in their instruments and contracts, in the first year of Simeon [Hearing], the great Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· and captain and leader of the Jews [Praisers].
1MA 13:43 In those days he encamped against Gazara, and compassed it round about with armies; and he made an engine of siege, and brought it up to the city, and struck a tower, and took it.
1MA 13:44 And they that were in the engine leaped forth into the city; and there was a great uproar in the city:
1MA 13:45 and they of the city tore their clothes, and went up on the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, making request to Simeon [Hearing] to give them his right hand.
1MA 13:46 And they said, Deal not with us according to the multitude of our wickedness, but according to your mercy.
1MA 13:47 And Simeon [Hearing] was reconciled to them, and did not fight against them: and he put them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with singing and giving praise.
1MA 13:48 And he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed in it such men as would keep Torah ·Teaching·, and made it stronger than it was before, and built therein a dwelling place for himself.
1MA 13:49 But they of the fortress in Jerusalem [City of peace] were hindered from going forth, and from going into the country, and from buying and selling; and they hungered exceedingly, and a great number of them perished through famine.
1MA 13:50 And they cried out to Simeon [Hearing], that he should give them his right hand; and he gave it to them: and he put them out from thence, and he cleansed the fortress from its pollutions.
1MA 13:51 And he entered into it on the twenty third day of the second month (Iyar ·Light / I Am God your healer, 2·), in the one hundred seventity first year, with praise and palm branches, and with harps, and with cymbals, and with viols, and with hymns, and with songs: because a great enemy was destroyed out of Israel [God prevails].
1MA 13:52 And he ordained that they should keep that day every year with gladness. And the hill of the temple that was by the fortress he made stronger than before, and there he lived, himself and his men.
1MA 13:53 And Simeon [Hearing] saw that John [Yah is gracious] his son was a valiant man, and he made him leader of all his forces: and he lived in Gazara.
1MA 14:1 And in the one hundred seventity second year king Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media [Middle-land], to get him help, that he might fight against Tryphon.
1MA 14:2 And Arsaces, the king of Persia [Descendants of Loving-kindness] and Media [Middle-land], heard that Demetrius was come into his borders, and he sent one of his princes to take him alive:
1MA 14:3 and he went and struck the army of Demetrius, and took him, and brought him to Arsaces; and he put him in ward.
1MA 14:4 And the land had rest all the days of Simeon [Hearing]: and he sought the good of his nation; and his authority and his glory was well-pleasing to them all his days.
1MA 14:5 And amid all his glory he took Joppa for a haven, and made it an entrance for the isles of the sea;
1MA 14:6 and he enlarged the borders of his nation, and got possession of the country;
1MA 14:7 and he gathered together a great number of captives, and got the dominion of Gazara, and Bethsura, and the fortress, and he took away the multitude of its uncleanness; and there was none that resisted him.
1MA 14:8 And they tilled their land in peace, and the land gave her increase, and the trees of the plains their fruit.
1MA 14:9 The ancient men sat in the streets, they communed all of them together of good things, and the young men put on glorious and warlike apparel.
1MA 14:10 He provided food for the cities, and furnished them with all manner of munition, until the name of his glory was named to the end of the earth.
1MA 14:11 He made peace in the land, and Israel [God prevails] rejoiced with great joy:
1MA 14:12 and they sat each man under his vine and his fig tree, and there was none to make them afraid:
1MA 14:13 and there ceased in the land any that fought against them: and the kings were embarrassed in those days.
1MA 14:14 And he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low: Torah ·Teaching· he searched out, and every distant from Torah ·Teaching· and wicked person he took away.
1MA 14:15 He glorified the sanctuary, and the utensils of the temple he multiplied.
1MA 14:16 And it was heard at Rome [Town of flowing waters] that Jonathan [Yah has given] was dead, and even to Sparta, and they were exceeding sorry.
1MA 14:17 But as soon as they heard that his brother Simeon [Hearing] was made Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· in his stead, and ruled the country, and the cities therein,
1MA 14:18 they wrote to him on tablets of bronze, to renew with him the friendship and the confederacy which they had confirmed with Judas [Praised] and Jonathan [Yah has given] his brethren;
1MA 14:19 and they were read before the congregation at Jerusalem [City of peace].
1MA 14:20 And this is the copy of the letters which the Spartans sent: The rulers of the Spartans, and the city, to Simeon [Hearing] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and to the elders, and the priests, and the residue of the people of the Jews [Praisers], our brethren, greeting:
1MA 14:21 The ambassadors that were sent to our people made report to us of your glory and honor: and we were glad for their coming,
1MA 14:22 and we did register the things that were spoken by them in the public records after this manner: Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, the Jews [Praisers]’ ambassadors, came to us to renew the friendship they had with us.
1MA 14:23 And it pleased the people to entertain the men honorably, and to put the copy of their words in the public records, to the end that the people of the Spartans might have a memorial thereof: moreover they wrote a copy of these things to Simeon [Hearing] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·.
1MA 14:24 After this Simeon [Hearing] sent Numenius to Rome [Town of flowing waters] with a great shield of gold of a thousand pound weight, in order to confirm the confederacy with them.
1MA 14:25 But when the people heard these things, they said, What thanks shall we give to Simeon [Hearing] and his sons?
1MA 14:26 for he and his brethren and the house of his father have made themselves strong, and have chased away in fight the enemies of Israel [God prevails] from them, and confirmed liberty to Israel [God prevails].
1MA 14:27 And they wrote on tablets of bronze, and set them upon pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing: On the eighteenth day of the sixth month of Elul ·Search, 6·, in the one hundred seventity second year, and this is the third year of Simeon [Hearing] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·,
1MA 14:28 in Asaramel, in a great congregation of priests and people and princes of the nation, and of the elders of the country, was it notified to us:
1MA 14:29 In as much as oftentimes there have been wars in the country, but Simeon [Hearing] the son of Mattathias [Gift of Yah], the son of the sons of Joarib, and his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and withstood the enemies of their nation, that their sanctuary and Torah ·Teaching· might be established, and glorified their nation with great glory:
1MA 14:30 and Jonathan [Yah has given] assembled their nation together, and became their Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and was gathered to his people:
1MA 14:31 and their enemies purposed to invade their country, that they might destroy their country utterly, and stretch forth their hands against their sanctuary:
1MA 14:32 then rose up Simeon [Hearing], and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of his nation, and gave them wages:
1MA 14:33 and he fortified the cities of Judea [Praise], and Bethsura that lies upon the borders of Judea [Praise], where the arms of the enemies were aforetime, and set there a garrison of Jews [Praisers]:
1MA 14:34 and he fortified Joppa which is upon the sea, and Gazara which is upon the borders of Azotus, wherein the enemies lived aforetime, and placed Jews [Praisers] there, and set therein all things convenient for the reparation thereof:
1MA 14:35 and the people saw the trusting faith in action of Simeon [Hearing], and the glory which he thought to bring to his nation, and they made him their leader and Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, because he had done all these things, and for the justice and the trusting faith which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to exalt his people:
1MA 14:36 and in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were taken away out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David [Beloved], they that were in Jerusalem [City of peace], who had made themselves a fortress, out of which they issued, and polluted all things round about the sanctuary, and did great hurt to its purity;
1MA 14:37 and he placed Jews [Praisers] therein, and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and made high the walls of Jerusalem [City of peace]:
1MA 14:38 and king Demetrius confirmed to him the role of Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· according to these things,
1MA 14:39 and made him one of his Friends, and honored him with great honor;
1MA 14:40 for he had heard say, that the Jews [Praisers] had been called by the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters] friends and confederates and brethren, and that they had met the ambassadors of Simeon [Hearing] honorably;
1MA 14:41 and that the Jews [Praisers] and the priests were well pleased that Simeon [Hearing] should be their leader and Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet;
1MA 14:42 and that he should be captain over them, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the arms, and over the strongholds; and that he should take charge of the sanctuary,
1MA 14:43 and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all instruments in the country should be written in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold;
1MA 14:44 and that it should not be lawful for any of the people or of the priests to set at nothing any of these things, or to gainsay the words that he should speak, or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold;
1MA 14:45 but whoever should do otherwise, or set at nothing any of these things, he should be liable to punishment.
1MA 14:46 All the people consented to ordain for Simeon [Hearing] that he should do according to these words;
1MA 14:47 and Simeon [Hearing] accepted hereof, and consented to be Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and to be captain and governor of the Jews [Praisers] and of the priests, and to be protector of all.
1MA 14:48 And they commanded to put this writing on tablets of bronze, and to set them up within the precinct of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place;
1MA 14:49 and moreover to put the copies thereof in the treasury, to the end that Simeon [Hearing] and his sons might have them.
1MA 15:1 And Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea to Simeon [Hearing] the priest and ethnarch [governor] of the Jews [Praisers], and to all the nation;
1MA 15:2 and the contents thereof were after this manner: King Antiochus to Simeon [Hearing] the chief priest and ethnarch [governor], and to the nation of the Jews [Praisers], greeting:
1MA 15:3 In as much as certain pestilent fellows have made themselves masters of the kingdom of our fathers, but my purpose is to claim the kingdom, that I may restore it as it was before; and moreover I have raised a multitude of foreign soldiers, and have prepared ships of war;
1MA 15:4 moreover I am minded to land in the country, that I may punish them that have destroyed our country, and them that have made many cities in the kingdom desolate:
1MA 15:5 Now therefore I confirm to you all the exactions which the kings that were before me remitted to you, and whatever gifts besides they remitted to you:
1MA 15:6 and I give you leave to coin money for your country with your own stamp,
1MA 15:7 but that Jerusalem [City of peace] and the sanctuary should be free: and all the arms that you have prepared, and the strongholds that you have built, which you have in your possession, let them remain to you:
1MA 15:8 and everything owing to the king, and the things that shall be owing to the king from henceforth and for evermore, let them be remitted to you:
1MA 15:9 moreover, when we shall have established our kingdom, we will glorify you and your nation and the temple with great glory, so that your glory shall be made manifest in all the earth.
1MA 15:10 In the one hundred seventity fourth year went Antiochus forth into the land of his fathers; and all the forces came together to him, so that there were few men with Tryphon.
1MA 15:11 And king Antiochus pursued him; as he fled, he came to Dor, which is by the sea:
1MA 15:12 for he knew that troubles were come upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him.
1MA 15:13 And Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him one hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horse.
1MA 15:14 And he compassed the city round about, and the ships joined in the attack from the sea; and he vexed the city by land and sea, and suffered no man to go out or in.
1MA 15:15 And Numenius and his company came from Rome [Town of flowing waters], having letters to the kings and to the countries, wherein were written these things:
1MA 15:16 Lucius, consul of the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters], to king Ptolemy, greeting:
1MA 15:17 The Jews [Praisers]’ ambassadors came to us as our friends and confederates, to renew the old friendship and confederacy, being sent from Simeon [Hearing] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, and from the people of the Jews [Praisers]:
1MA 15:18 moreover they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.
1MA 15:19 It pleased us therefore to write to the kings and to the countries, that they should not seek their hurt, nor fight against them, and their cities, and their country, nor be confederates with such as fight against them.
1MA 15:20 Moreover it seemed good to us to receive the shield of them.
1MA 15:21 If therefore any pestilent fellows have fled from their country to you, deliver them to Simeon [Hearing] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, that he may take vengeance on them according to their law.
1MA 15:22 And the same things wrote he to Demetrius the king, and to Attalus, and to Arathes, and to Arsaces,
1MA 15:23 and to all the countries, and to Sampsames, and to the Spartans, and to Delos, and to Myndos, and to Sicyon, and to Caria, and to Samos, and to Pamphylia, and to Lycia, and to Halicarnassus, and to Rhodes, and to Phaselis, and to Cos, and to Side, and to Aradus, and Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.
1MA 15:24 But the copy hereof they wrote to Simeon [Hearing] the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·.
1MA 15:25 But Antiochus the king encamped against Dor the second day, bringing his forces up to it continually, and making engines of war, and he shut up Tryphon from going in or out.
1MA 15:26 And Simeon [Hearing] sent him two thousand chosen men to fight on his side; and silver, and gold, and instruments of war in abundance.
1MA 15:27 And he would not receive them, but set at nothing all the covenants which he had made with him aforetime, and was estranged from him.
1MA 15:28 And he sent to him Athenobius, one of his Friends, to commune with him, saying, You hold possession of Joppa and Gazara, and the fortress that is in Jerusalem [City of peace], cities of my kingdom.
1MA 15:29 The borders thereof you have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places in my kingdom.
1MA 15:30 Now therefore deliver up the cities which you have taken, and the tributes of the places whereof you have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea [Praise]:
1MA 15:31 or else give me for them five hundred talents [300,000 denarii; 258,750 lb; 11,700 kg] of silver; and for the harm that you have done, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents [300,000 denarii; 258,750 lb; 11,700 kg]: or else we will come and subdue you.
1MA 15:32 And Athenobius the king’s Friend came to Jerusalem [City of peace]; and he saw the glory of Simeon [Hearing], and the cupboard of gold and silver vessels, and his great attendance, and he was amazed; and he reported to him the king’s words.
1MA 15:33 And Simeon [Hearing] answered, and said to him, We have neither taken other men’s land, nor have we possession of that which appertains to others, but of the inheritance of our fathers; howbeit, it was had in possession of our enemies wrongfully for a certain time.
1MA 15:34 But we, having opportunity, hold fast the inheritance of our fathers.
1MA 15:35 But as touching Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they did great harm among the people throughout our country, we will give one hundred talents [600,000 denarii; 51,750 lb; 2,340 kg] for them. And he answered him not a word,
1MA 15:36 but returned in a rage to the king, and reported to him these words, and the glory of Simeon [Hearing], and all that he had seen: and the king was exceeding angry.
1MA 15:37 But Tryphon embarked on board a ship, and fled to Orthosia.
1MA 15:38 And the king appointed Cendebaeus chief captain of the sea coast, and gave him forces of foot and horse:
1MA 15:39 and he commanded him to encamp before Judea [Praise], and he commanded him to build up Kidron, and to fortify the gates, and that he should fight against the people: but the king pursued Tryphon.
1MA 15:40 And Cendebaeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to invade Judea [Praise], and to take the people captive, and to kill them.
1MA 15:41 And he built Kidron, and set horsemen there, and forces of foot, to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea [Praise], according as the king commanded him.
1MA 16:1 And John [Yah is gracious] went up from Gazara, and told Simeon [Hearing] his father what Cendebaeus was doing.
1MA 16:2 And Simeon [Hearing] called his two oldest sons, Judas [Praised] and John [Yah is gracious], and said to them, I and my brethren and my father’s house have fought the battles of Israel [God prevails] from our youth, even to this day; and things have prospered in our hands, that we should deliver Israel [God prevails] oftentimes.
1MA 16:3 But now I am old, and you moreover, by his mercy, are of a sufficient age: be you instead of me and my brother, and go forth and fight for our nation; but let the help which is from heaven (God) be with you.
1MA 16:4 And he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war and horsemen, and they went against Cendebaeus, and slept at Modin.
1MA 16:5 And rising up in the morning, they went into the plain, and, behold, a great host came to meet them, of footmen and horsemen: and there was a brook between them.
1MA 16:6 And he encamped over against them, he and his people: and he saw that the people were afraid to pass over the brook, and he passed over first, and the men saw him, and passed over after him.
1MA 16:7 And he divided the people, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: but the enemies’ horsemen were exceeding many.
1MA 16:8 And they sounded with the trumpets; and Cendebaeus and his army were put to the rout, and there fell of them many wounded to death, but they that were left fled to the stronghold:
1MA 16:9 at that time was Judas [Praised] John [Yah is gracious]’s brother wounded: but John [Yah is gracious] pursued after them, till he came to Kidron, which Cendebaeus had built;
1MA 16:10 and they fled to the towers that are in the fields of Azotus; and he burned it with fire; and there fell of them about two thousand men. And he returned into Judea [Praise] in peace.
1MA 16:11 And Ptolemy the son of Abubus had been appointed captain for the plain of Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], and he had much silver and gold;
1MA 16:12 for he was the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·’s son in law.
1MA 16:13 And his heart was lifted up, and he was minded to make himself master of the country, and he took counsel deceitfully against Simeon [Hearing] and his sons, to make away with them.
1MA 16:14 Now Simeon [Hearing] was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of them; and he went down to Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], himself and Mattathias [Gift of Yah] and Judas [Praised] his sons, in the one hundred seventity seventh year, in the eleventh month Shevat ·Staff / Rod / Royal scepter·, the same is the month Sebat:
1MA 16:15 and the son of Abubus received them deceitfully into the little stronghold that is called Dok, which he had built, and made them a great banquet, and hid men there.
1MA 16:16 And when Simeon [Hearing] and his sons had drunk freely, Ptolemy and his men rose up, and took their arms, and came in upon Simeon [Hearing] into the banqueting place, and killed him, and his two sons, and certain of his servants.
1MA 16:17 And he committed a great iniquity, and recompensed evil for good.
1MA 16:18 And Ptolemy wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him forces to aid him, and should deliver him their country and the cities.
1MA 16:19 And he sent others to Gazara to make away with John [Yah is gracious]: and to the captains of thousands he sent letters to come to him, that he might give them silver and gold and gifts.
1MA 16:20 And others he sent to take possession of Jerusalem [City of peace], and the mount of the temple.
1MA 16:21 And one ran before to Gazara, and told John [Yah is gracious] that his father and brethren were perished, and he has sent to kill you also.
1MA 16:22 And when he heard, he was sore amazed; and he laid hands on the men that came to destroy him, and killed them; for he perceived that they were seeking to destroy him.
1MA 16:23 And the rest of the acts of John [Yah is gracious], and of his wars, and of his valiant deeds which he did, and of the building of the walls which he built, and of his doings,
1MA 16:24 behold, they are written in the chronicles of his role as Cohen Gadol ·High Priest·, from the time that he was made Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· after his father.
PSX 1:1 I was small among my brothers, and youngest in my father’s house. I tended my father’s sheep.
PSX 1:2 My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a lute.
PSX 1:3 Who shall tell adonai ·my Lord·? Adonai himself, he himself hears.
PSX 1:4 He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep, and he anointed me with his anointing oil.
PSX 1:5 My brothers were handsome and tall; but Adonai did not take pleasure in them.
PSX 1:6 I went out to meet the Philistine [To roll in dust (As an insult)], and he cursed me by his idols.
PSX 1:7 But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel [God prevails].
MAT 1:1 The book of the genealogy of Yeshua Messiah [Anointed one], the son of David [Beloved], the son of Abraham [Father of a multitude].
MAT 1:2 Abraham [Father of a multitude] became the father of Isaac [Laughter]. Isaac [Laughter] became the father of Jacob [Supplanter]. Jacob [Supplanter] became the father of Judah [Praised] and his brothers.
MAT 1:3 Judah [Praised] became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar [Palm tree]. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram.
MAT 1:4 Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon.
MAT 1:5 Salmon became the father of Boaz [In majesty, in strength] by Rahab. Boaz [In majesty, in strength] became the father of Obed by Ruth [Friend]. Obed became the father of Jesse [My husband].
MAT 1:6 Jesse [My husband] became the father of King David [Beloved]. David [Beloved] became the father of Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense] by her who had been Uriah [My light Yah]’s wife.
MAT 1:7 Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense] became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah [My father Yah]. Abijah [My father Yah] became the father of Asa.
MAT 1:8 Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah.
MAT 1:9 Uzziah became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah.
MAT 1:10 Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh [Causing to forget]. Manasseh [Causing to forget] became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah.
MAT 1:11 Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon [Confusion].
MAT 1:12 After the exile to Babylon [Confusion], Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
MAT 1:13 Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor.
MAT 1:14 Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.
MAT 1:15 Eliud became the father of Eleazar [Help of God]. Eleazar [Help of God] became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the father of Jacob [Supplanter].
MAT 1:16 Jacob [Supplanter] became the father of Joseph [May he add], the husband of Mary [Rebellion], from whom was born Yeshua [Salvation], who is called Messiah [Anointed one].
MAT 1:17 So all the generations from Abraham [Father of a multitude] to David [Beloved] are fourteen generations; from David [Beloved] to the exile to Babylon [Confusion] fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon [Confusion] to the Messiah [Anointed one], fourteen generations.
MAT 1:18 Now the birth of Yeshua Messiah [Salvation Anointed one] was like this; for after his mother, Mary [Rebellion], was engaged to Joseph [May he add], before they came together, she was found pregnant by Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness].
MAT 1:19 Joseph [May he add], her husband, being a upright man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to divorce her secretly.
MAT 1:20 But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of MarYah [Master Yahweh] appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph [May he add], son of David [Beloved], don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary [Rebellion], your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness].
MAT 1:21 She shall give birth to a son. You shall call his name Yeshua [Salvation], for it is he who shall save his people from their abstract sins ·miss the marks·.”
MAT 1:22 Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by MarYah [Master Yahweh] through the prophet, saying,
MAT 1:23 “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall give birth to a son. They shall call his name 'Immanu El [God is with us];” which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”
MAT 1:24 Joseph [May he add] arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of MarYah [Master Yahweh] commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
MAT 1:25 and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Yeshua [Salvation].
MAT 2:1 Now when Yeshua [Salvation] was born in Bethlehem [House of Bread] of Judea [Praise] in the days of King Herod [Heroic], behold, Magi [Conjurer] (Persian King makers, Astrologers) from the east came to Jerusalem [City of peace], saying,
MAT 2:2 “Where is he who is born King of the Jews [Praisers]? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.”
MAT 2:3 When King Herod [Heroic] heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem [City of peace] with him.
MAT 2:4 Gathering together all the chief priests and Torah-Teachers of the people, he asked them where the Messiah [Anointed one] would be born.
MAT 2:5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem [House of Bread] of Judea [Praise], for this is written through the prophet,
MAT 2:6 ‘You Bethlehem [House of Bread], land of Judah [Praised], are in no way least among the princes of Judah [Praised]: for out of you shall come a governor, who shall shepherd my people, Israel [God prevails].’”
MAT 2:7 Then Herod [Heroic] secretly called the Magi [Conjurer] (Persian King makers, Astrologers), and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.
MAT 2:8 He sent them to Bethlehem [House of Bread], and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.”
MAT 2:9 They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
MAT 2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
MAT 2:11 They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary [Rebellion], his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
MAT 2:12 Being warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod [Heroic], they went back to their own country another route.
MAT 2:13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of MarYah [Master Yahweh] appeared to Joseph [May he add] in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt [Abode of slavery], and stay there until I tell you, for Herod [Heroic] will seek the young child to destroy him.”
MAT 2:14 He arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt [Abode of slavery],
MAT 2:15 and was there until the death of Herod [Heroic]; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by MarYah [Master Yahweh] through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt [Abode of slavery] I called my son.”
MAT 2:16 Then Herod [Heroic], when he saw that he was mocked by the Magi [Conjurer] (Persian King makers, Astrologers), was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem [House of Bread] and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the Magi [Conjurer] (Persian King makers, Astrologers).
MAT 2:17 Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah [Yah lifts up] the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
MAT 2:18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning, Rachel [Ewe sheep] is weeping for her children; and she wouldn’t be comforted, because they are no more.”
MAT 2:19 But when Herod [Heroic] was dead, behold, an angel of MarYah [Master Yahweh] appeared in a dream to Joseph [May he add] in Egypt [Abode of slavery], saying,
MAT 2:20 “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel [God prevails], for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.”
MAT 2:21 He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel [God prevails].
MAT 2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea [Praise] in the place of his father, Herod [Heroic], he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee [District, Circuit],
MAT 2:23 and came and lived in a city called Nazareth [Branch, Separated one]; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene [person from Branch, Separated one].”
MAT 3:1 In those days, John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea [Praise], saying ,
MAT 3:2 “ Teshuvah ·Turn repent·, for the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is at hand!”
MAT 3:3 For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet, saying, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of MarYah [Master Yahweh]. Make his paths straight.”
MAT 3:4 Now John [Yah is gracious] himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
MAT 3:5 Then people from Jerusalem [City of peace], all of Judea [Praise], and all the region around the Jordan [Descender] went out to him.
MAT 3:6 They were immersed by him in the Jordan [Descender], confessing their abstract sins ·miss the marks·.
MAT 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees [Separated] and Sadducees [Morally-upright] coming for his mikvah ·ritual washing baptism·, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
MAT 3:8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of teshuvah ·complete repentance·!
MAT 3:9 Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham [Father of a multitude] Avinu ·our Father·,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham [Father of a multitude] from these stones.
MAT 3:10 “Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
MAT 3:11 I indeed mikvah ·mikvah ·baptise· you in water for teshuvah ·complete repentance·, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will mikvah ·baptise· you in Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness].
MAT 3:12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.”
MAT 3:13 Then Yeshua [Salvation] came from Galilee [District, Circuit] to the Jordan [Descender] to John [Yah is gracious], to be immersed by him.
MAT 3:14 But John [Yah is gracious] would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be immersed by you, and you come to me?”
MAT 3:15 But Yeshua [Salvation], answering, said to him, “Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.
MAT 3:16 Yeshua [Salvation], when he was immersed, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.
MAT 3:17 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is my agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
MAT 4:1 Then Yeshua [Salvation] was led up by haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil [Accuser].
MAT 4:2 When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.
MAT 4:3 The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·, command that these stones become bread.”
MAT 4:4 But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Adonai .’”
MAT 4:5 Then the devil [Accuser] took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
MAT 4:6 and said to him, “If you are the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will enjoin his angels unto you.’ And, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”
MAT 4:7 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test MarYah [Master Yahweh], your God.’”
MAT 4:8 Again, the devil [Accuser] took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
MAT 4:9 He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”
MAT 4:10 Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Get behind me, Satan [Adversary]! For it is written, ‘You shall worship MarYah [Master Yahweh] your God, and you shall serve him only.’”
MAT 4:11 Then the devil [Accuser] left him, and behold, angels came and served him.
MAT 4:12 Now when Yeshua [Salvation] heard that John [Yah is gracious] was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee [District, Circuit].
MAT 4:13 Leaving Nazareth [Branch, Separated one], he came and lived in Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun [Living together] and Naphtali [My wrestling],
MAT 4:14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet, saying,
MAT 4:15 “The land of Zebulun [Living together] and the land of Naphtali [My wrestling], toward the sea, beyond the Jordan [Descender], Galil-of-the-Goyim [District, Circuit of Non-Jews],
MAT 4:16 the people who lived in darkness saw a great light, to those who live in the land of the shadow of death, to them light has dawned.”
MAT 4:17 From that time, Yeshua [Salvation] began to preach, and to say, “ Teshuvah ·Turn repent·! For the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is at hand.”
MAT 4:18 Walking by the sea of Galilee [District, Circuit], he saw two brothers: Simeon [Hearing], who is called Peter [Rock], and Andrew [Manly], his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
MAT 4:19 He said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men.”
MAT 4:20 They immediately left their nets and followed him.
MAT 4:21 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee [Surplanter son of Yah Has Bestowed], and John [Yah is gracious] his brother, in the boat with Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah] their father, mending their nets. He called them.
MAT 4:22 They immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.
MAT 4:23 Yeshua [Salvation] went about in all Galilee [District, Circuit], teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
MAT 4:24 The report about him went out into all Syria [Elevated]. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.
MAT 4:25 Great multitudes from Galilee [District, Circuit], Decapolis, Jerusalem [City of peace], Judea [Praise] and from beyond the Jordan [Descender] followed him.
MAT 5:1 Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
MAT 5:2 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
MAT 5:3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit! for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven (God).
MAT 5:4 Blessed are those who mourn! for they shall be comforted.
MAT 5:5 Blessed are the meek! for they shall inherit the Land.
MAT 5:6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness! For they shall be filled.
MAT 5:7 Blessed are the merciful! for they shall obtain mercy.
MAT 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart! for they shall see God.
MAT 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers! for they shall be called children of God.
MAT 5:10 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake! for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven (God).
MAT 5:11 “Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
MAT 5:12 Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
MAT 5:13 “You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.
MAT 5:14 You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden.
MAT 5:15 Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.
MAT 5:16 Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify 'Avikah shebashamayim ·your Father in Heaven·.
MAT 5:17 “Don’t think that I came to destroy the Torah ·Teaching· or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill.
MAT 5:18 For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the Torah ·Teaching·, until all things are accomplished.
MAT 5:19 Therefore, whoever shall disobey the least mitzvot ·instructions· and teaches others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven (God). But whoever shall obey them and so teaches shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven (God).
MAT 5:20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven (God).
MAT 5:21 “You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’ and ‘Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’
MAT 5:22 But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be in danger of the judgment; and whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca! ·Vain, empty, worthless, to spit upon, good-for-nothing·!’ will be in danger of the Sanhedrin ·Sitting together·; and whoever says, ‘Fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead).
MAT 5:23 “If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
MAT 5:24 leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
MAT 5:25 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
MAT 5:26 Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last quadrans coin (Roman quarter coin about 3/8 of a cent).
MAT 5:27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not moicheuo ·commit adultery·;’
MAT 5:28 but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has moicheuo ·committed adultery· with her already in his heart.
MAT 5:29 If your right eye causes you to scandalize ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead).
MAT 5:30 If your right hand causes you to scandalize ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead).
MAT 5:31 “It was also said, ‘Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a get ·certificate of divorce·,’
MAT 5:32 but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of porhneia ·sexual immorality·, makes her moicheuo ·become an adulterer·; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits moichao ·act of adultery·.
MAT 5:33 “Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, ‘You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to MarYah [Master Yahweh] your vows,’
MAT 5:34 but I tell you, don’t swear at all: neither 'by heaven', for it is the throne of God;
MAT 5:35 nor 'by the earth', for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem [City of peace], for it is the city of the great King.
MAT 5:36 Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can’t make one hair white or black.
MAT 5:37 But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.
MAT 5:38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’
MAT 5:39 But I tell you, don’t resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
MAT 5:40 If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.
MAT 5:41 Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
MAT 5:42 Give to him who asks you, and don’t turn away him who desires to borrow from you.
MAT 5:43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall show agapao ·total devoted love· to your neighbor and hate and detest your enemy.’
MAT 5:44 But I tell you, show agapao ·total devoted love· to your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate and detest you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,
MAT 5:45 that you may be children of 'Avikah shebashamayim ·your Father in Heaven·. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
MAT 5:46 For if you show agapao ·total devoted love· those who show agapao ·total devoted love· to you, what reward do you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?
MAT 5:47 If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same?
MAT 5:48 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as 'Avikah shebashamayim ·your Father in Heaven· is perfect.
MAT 6:1 “Be careful that you don’t do your charitable giving before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from 'Avikah shebashamayim ·your Father in Heaven·.
MAT 6:2 Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don’t sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
MAT 6:3 But when you do merciful deeds, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand does,
MAT 6:4 so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then 'Avikah ·your Father· who sees in secret will reward you openly.
MAT 6:5 “When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard· to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.
MAT 6:6 But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to 'Avikah ·your Father· who is in secret, and 'Avikah ·your Father· who sees in secret will reward you openly.
MAT 6:7 In praying, don’t use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
MAT 6:8 Therefore don’t be like them, for 'Avikah ·your Father· knows what things you need, before you ask him.
MAT 6:9 Pray like this: Avinu shebashamayim ·our Father in Heaven·, may your name be kept holy.
MAT 6:10 Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
MAT 6:11 Provide us today our daily bread.
MAT 6:12 Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
MAT 6:13 Do not lead us into hard testing, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen ·So be it·.’
MAT 6:14 “For if you forgive men their lapse and deviation from truth, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
MAT 6:15 But if you don’t forgive men their lapse and deviation from truth, neither will 'Avikah ·your Father· forgive your lapse and deviation from truth.
MAT 6:16 “Moreover when you fast, don’t be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
MAT 6:17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;
MAT 6:18 so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by 'Avikah ·your Father· who is in secret, and 'Avikah ·your Father·, who sees in secret, will reward you.
MAT 6:19 “Don’t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
MAT 6:20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don’t break through and steal;
MAT 6:21 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
MAT 6:22 “The lamp candle of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
MAT 6:23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
MAT 6:24 “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and have agapao ·total devotion love· to the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can’t serve both God and Mammon ·Wealth·.
MAT 6:25 Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
MAT 6:26 See the birds of the sky, that they don’t sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you of much more value than they?
MAT 6:27 “Which of you, by being anxious, can add one cubit [18 in; 45.72 cm] to his lifespan?
MAT 6:28 Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin,
MAT 6:29 yet I tell you that even Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense] in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.
MAT 6:30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little trusting faith?
MAT 6:31 “Therefore don’t be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’
MAT 6:32 For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
MAT 6:33 But seek first God’s Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.
MAT 6:34 Therefore don’t be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day’s own evil is sufficient.
MAT 7:1 “Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged.
MAT 7:2 For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.
MAT 7:3 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?
MAT 7:4 Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye;’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye?
MAT 7:5 You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.
MAT 7:6 “Don’t give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
MAT 7:7 “Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.
MAT 7:8 For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
MAT 7:9 Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
MAT 7:10 Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?
MAT 7:11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will 'Avikah shebashamayim ·your Father in Heaven· give good things to those who ask him!
MAT 7:12 Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the Torah ·Teaching· and the Prophets.
MAT 7:13 “Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.
MAT 7:14 How narrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.
MAT 7:15 “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
MAT 7:16 By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
MAT 7:17 Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.
MAT 7:18 A good tree can’t produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.
MAT 7:19 Every tree that does not grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.
MAT 7:20 Therefore by their fruits you will know them.
MAT 7:21 Not everyone who says to me, ‘Master, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven (God); but he who does the will of 'Avi shebashamayim ·my Father in Heaven·.
MAT 7:22 Many will tell me in that day, ‘Master, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?’
MAT 7:23 Then I will tell them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work illegally ·to be without Torah (ignorant or intentional violation of law)·.’
MAT 7:24 “Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.
MAT 7:25 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn’t fall, for it was founded on the rock.
MAT 7:26 Everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand.
MAT 7:27 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell— and great was its fall.”
MAT 7:28 When Yeshua [Salvation] had finished saying these things, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
MAT 7:29 for he taught them with authority, and not like the Torah-Teachers.
MAT 8:1 When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
MAT 8:2 Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”
MAT 8:3 Yeshua [Salvation] stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately his tzara'at ·leprosy· was cleansed.
MAT 8:4 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses [Drawn out] commanded, as a testimony to them.”
MAT 8:5 When he came into Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], a centurion came to him, asking him,
MAT 8:6 and saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”
MAT 8:7 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “I will come and heal him.”
MAT 8:8 The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
MAT 8:9 For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
MAT 8:10 When Yeshua [Salvation] heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, “Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a trusting faith, not even in Israel [God prevails].
MAT 8:11 I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham [Father of a multitude], Isaac [Laughter], and Jacob [Supplanter] in the Kingdom of Heaven (God),
MAT 8:12 but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
MAT 8:13 Yeshua [Salvation] said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have trusted.” His servant was healed in that hour.
MAT 8:14 When Yeshua [Salvation] came into Peter [Rock]’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.
MAT 8:15 He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him.
MAT 8:16 When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;
MAT 8:17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”
MAT 8:18 Now when Yeshua [Salvation] saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.
MAT 8:19 A scribe came, and said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, I will follow you wherever you go.”
MAT 8:20 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
MAT 8:21 Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
MAT 8:22 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”
MAT 8:23 When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.
MAT 8:24 Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.
MAT 8:25 They came to him, and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”
MAT 8:26 He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little trusting faith?” Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
MAT 8:27 The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
MAT 8:28 When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.
MAT 8:29 Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Yeshua [Salvation], Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”
MAT 8:30 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
MAT 8:31 The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”
MAT 8:32 He said to them, “Go!” They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
MAT 8:33 Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.
MAT 8:34 Behold, all the city came out to meet Yeshua [Salvation]. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.
MAT 9:1 He entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.
MAT 9:2 Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Yeshua [Salvation], seeing their trusting faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, cheer up! Your abstract sins ·miss the marks· are forgiven you.”
MAT 9:3 Behold, some of the Torah-Teachers said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.”
MAT 9:4 Yeshua [Salvation], knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?
MAT 9:5 For which is easier, to say, ‘Your abstract sins ·miss the marks· are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk?’
MAT 9:6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive abstract sins ·miss the marks·,” (then he said to the paralytic), “Get up, and take up your mat, and go to your house.”
MAT 9:7 He arose and departed to his house.
MAT 9:8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
MAT 9:9 As Yeshua [Salvation] passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew [Gift of Yah] sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, “Follow me.” He got up and followed him.
MAT 9:10 As he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· came and sat down with Yeshua [Salvation] and his disciples.
MAT 9:11 When the Pharisees [Separated] saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why does your Rabbi ·Teacher· eat with tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·?”
MAT 9:12 When Yeshua [Salvation] heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
MAT 9:13 But you go and learn what this means: ‘I desire eleos ·merciful compassion in action·, not sacrifice,’ for I came not to call the upright, but sinners devoted to sin ·miss the marks and be without share in the goal (and stained by definite crime vice)· to teshuvah ·complete repentance·.”
MAT 9:14 Then John [Yah is gracious]’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees [Separated] fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?”
MAT 9:15 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
MAT 9:16 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.
MAT 9:17 Neither do people put new wine into old wine skins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved.”
MAT 9:18 While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
MAT 9:19 Yeshua [Salvation] got up and followed him, as did his disciples.
MAT 9:20 Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the tzitzit ·fringes· on his outer garment;
MAT 9:21 for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”
MAT 9:22 But Yeshua [Salvation], turning around and seeing her, said, “Daughter, cheer up! Your trusting faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.
MAT 9:23 When Yeshua [Salvation] came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
MAT 9:24 he said to them, “Make room, because the girl is not dead, but sleeping.” They were ridiculing him.
MAT 9:25 But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
MAT 9:26 The report of this went out into all that land.
MAT 9:27 As Yeshua [Salvation] passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David [Beloved]!”
MAT 9:28 When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Do you trust that I am able to do this?” They told him, “Yes, Lord.”
MAT 9:29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your trusting faith be it done to you.”
MAT 9:30 Their eyes were opened. Yeshua [Salvation] strictly commanded them, saying, “See that no one knows about this.”
MAT 9:31 But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
MAT 9:32 As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him.
MAT 9:33 When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel [God prevails]!”
MAT 9:34 But the Pharisees [Separated] said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.”
MAT 9:35 Yeshua [Salvation] went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
MAT 9:36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
MAT 9:37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
MAT 9:38 Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest.”
MAT 10:1 He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
MAT 10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simeon [Hearing], who is called Peter [Rock]; Andrew [Manly], his brother; James son of Zebedee [Surplanter son of Yah Has Bestowed]; John [Yah is gracious], his brother;
MAT 10:3 Philip [Loves horses]; Bartholomew [Son who suspends waters]; Thomas [Seeker of truth]; Matthew [Gift of Yah] the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus [Surplanter son-of Changing]; Lebbaeus [Child of courage], who was also called Thaddaeus [Child of heart];
MAT 10:4 Simeon [Hearing] the Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled]; and Judas Iscariot [Praised Dagger-man], who also betrayed him.
MAT 10:5 Yeshua [Salvation] sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans [people from Watch-mountain] .
MAT 10:6 Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel [God prevails].
MAT 10:7 As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven (God) is at hand!’
MAT 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the people afflicted with tzara'at ·leprosy·, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.
MAT 10:9 Don’t take any gold, silver, or brass in your money belts.
MAT 10:10 Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
MAT 10:11 Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.
MAT 10:12 As you enter into the household, say “Shalom aleikhem! ·Complete peace my family·!.
MAT 10:13 If the household deserves it, let your shalom ·complete peace· come on it, but if it is not, let your shalom ·complete peace· make teshuvah ·complete return· to you.
MAT 10:14 Whoever does not receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.
MAT 10:15 Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants] in the day of judgment than for that city.
MAT 10:16 “Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
MAT 10:17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
MAT 10:18 Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
MAT 10:19 But when they deliver you up, don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.
MAT 10:20 For it is not you who speak, but haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] of 'Avikah ·your Father· who speaks in you.
MAT 10:21 “Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
MAT 10:22 You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.
MAT 10:23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel [God prevails], until the Son of Man has come.
MAT 10:24 “A disciple is not above his Rabbi ·Teacher·, nor a servant above his lord.
MAT 10:25 It is enough for the disciple that he be like his Rabbi ·Teacher·, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Ba'al-Zibbul [Lord of Flies], how much more those of his household!
MAT 10:26 Therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.
MAT 10:27 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
MAT 10:28 Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead).
MAT 10:29 “Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion coin (a trivial cost)? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from 'Avikah ·your Father·’s will,
MAT 10:30 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
MAT 10:31 Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
MAT 10:32 Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before 'Avi shebashamayim ·my Father in Heaven·.
MAT 10:33 But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before 'Avi shebashamayim ·my Father in Heaven·.
MAT 10:34 “Don’t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn’t come to send peace, but a machaira ·machete, small sword knife·.
MAT 10:35 For I came to set a son at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
MAT 10:36 A man’s foes will be those of his own household.
MAT 10:37 He who phileo ·affectionately loves, has high regard, approval of· father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who phileo ·affectionately loves, has high regard, approval of· son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
MAT 10:38 He who does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
MAT 10:39 He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
MAT 10:40 He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
MAT 10:41 He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. He who receives a upright man in the name of a upright man will receive a upright man’s reward.
MAT 10:42 Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward.”
MAT 11:1 When Yeshua [Salvation] had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
MAT 11:2 Now when John [Yah is gracious] heard in the prison the works of Messiah [Anointed one], he sent two of his disciples
MAT 11:3 and said to him, “Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?”
MAT 11:4 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Go and tell John [Yah is gracious] the things which you hear and see:
MAT 11:5 the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the people afflicted with tzara'at ·leprosy· are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are being raised, and the poor have good news preached to them.
MAT 11:6 Blessed is he who finds no occasion for being scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· in me.”
MAT 11:7 As these went their way, Yeshua [Salvation] began to say to the multitudes concerning John [Yah is gracious], “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
MAT 11:8 But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.
MAT 11:9 But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
MAT 11:10 For this is he, of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’
MAT 11:11 Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is greater than he.
MAT 11:12 From the days of John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser until now, the Kingdom of Heaven (God) suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
MAT 11:13 For all the prophets and the Torah ·Teaching· prophesied until John [Yah is gracious].
MAT 11:14 If you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah [My God Yah] whose coming was predicted.
MAT 11:15 He who has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·.
MAT 11:16 “But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions
MAT 11:17 and say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’
MAT 11:18 For John [Yah is gracious] came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
MAT 11:19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”
MAT 11:20 Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didn’t teshuvah ·turn repent·.
MAT 11:21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have make teshuvah ·complete repentance· long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
MAT 11:22 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
MAT 11:23 You, Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will go down to Hades / Sh'ol ·Place of the dead·. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom [Burning] which were done in you, it would have remained until today.
MAT 11:24 But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom [Burning], on the day of judgment, than for you.”
MAT 11:25 At that time, Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “I thank you, Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants.
MAT 11:26 Yes, Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
MAT 11:27 All things have been delivered to me by 'Avi ·my Father·. No one knows the Son, except the Abba ·Father·; neither does anyone know the Abba ·Father·, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him.
MAT 11:28 “Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest .
MAT 11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
MAT 11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
MAT 12:1 At that time, Yeshua [Salvation] went on the Sabbath ·To cease· day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
MAT 12:2 But the Pharisees [Separated], when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ·To cease·.”
MAT 12:3 But he said to them, “Haven’t you read what David [Beloved] did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
MAT 12:4 how he entered in the house of MarYah [Master Yahweh], and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
MAT 12:5 Or have you not read in the Torah ·Teaching·, that on the Sabbath ·To cease· day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath ·To cease·, and are guiltless?
MAT 12:6 But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
MAT 12:7 But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire eleos ·merciful compassion in action·, not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.
MAT 12:8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath ·To cease·.”
MAT 12:9 He departed there, and went into their synagogue.
MAT 12:10 And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ·To cease· day?” that they might accuse him.
MAT 12:11 He said to them, “What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath ·To cease· day, won’t he grab on to it, and lift it out?
MAT 12:12 Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath ·To cease· day.”
MAT 12:13 Then he told the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.
MAT 12:14 But the Pharisees [Separated] went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.
MAT 12:15 Yeshua [Salvation], perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,
MAT 12:16 and commanded them that they should not make him known:
MAT 12:17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet, saying,
MAT 12:18 “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· on him. He will proclaim justice to the nations.
MAT 12:19 He will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
MAT 12:20 He won’t break a bruised reed. He won’t quench a smoking flax, until he leads justice to victory.
MAT 12:21 In his name, the nations will hope.”
MAT 12:22 Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.
MAT 12:23 All the multitudes were amazed, and said, “Can this be the son of David [Beloved]?”
MAT 12:24 But when the Pharisees [Separated] heard it, they said, “This man does not cast out demons, except by Ba'al-Zibbul [Lord of Flies], the prince of the demons.”
MAT 12:25 Knowing their thoughts, Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
MAT 12:26 If Satan [Adversary] casts out Satan [Adversary], he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
MAT 12:27 If I by Ba'al-Zibbul [Lord of Flies] cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
MAT 12:28 But if I by Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· of God cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come upon you.
MAT 12:29 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.
MAT 12:30 “He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters .
MAT 12:31 Therefore I tell you, every abstract sin ·miss the mark· and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] will not be forgiven men.
MAT 12:32 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness], it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.
MAT 12:33 “Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.
MAT 12:34 You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
MAT 12:35 The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things.
MAT 12:36 I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
MAT 12:37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”
MAT 12:38 Then certain of the Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated] answered, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we want to see a sign from you.”
MAT 12:39 But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah [Dove] the prophet.
MAT 12:40 For as Jonah [Dove] was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
MAT 12:41 The men of Nineveh [Offspring’s Habitation] will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they make teshuvah ·complete repentance· at the preaching of Jonah [Dove]; and behold, someone greater than Jonah [Dove] is here.
MAT 12:42 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense]; and behold, someone greater than Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense] is here.”
MAT 12:43 “When an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.
MAT 12:44 Then he says, ‘I will teshuvah ·completely return· into my house from which I came out,’ and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.
MAT 12:45 Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation.”
MAT 12:46 While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
MAT 12:47 One said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.”
MAT 12:48 But he answered him who spoke to him, “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”
MAT 12:49 He stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!
MAT 12:50 For whoever does the will of 'Avi shebashamayim ·my Father in Heaven·, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.”
MAT 13:1 On that day Yeshua [Salvation] went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
MAT 13:2 Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.
MAT 13:3 He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, “Behold, a farmer went out to sow.
MAT 13:4 As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.
MAT 13:5 Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.
MAT 13:6 When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.
MAT 13:7 Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.
MAT 13:8 Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
MAT 13:9 He who has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·.”
MAT 13:10 The disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
MAT 13:11 He answered them, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven (God), but it is not given to them.
MAT 13:12 For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.
MAT 13:13 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear, neither do they understand.
MAT 13:14 In them the prophecy of Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] is fulfilled, which says, ‘You will keep on hearing, but will in no way understand; and keep on seeing, but will in no way perceive,
MAT 13:15 for the heart of this people has grown callous, their ears bearly hear, they have closed their eyes; so as to not see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would make teshuvah ·complete return in repentance· again; so that I could heal them.’
MAT 13:16 “But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
MAT 13:17 For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and upright men desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.
MAT 13:18 “Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.
MAT 13:19 When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and does not understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.
MAT 13:20 What was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
MAT 13:21 yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he is scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·.
MAT 13:22 What was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
MAT 13:23 What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”
MAT 13:24 He set another parable before them, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,
MAT 13:25 but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away.
MAT 13:26 But when the blade sprang up and produced fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.
MAT 13:27 The servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?’
MAT 13:28 “He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ “The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’
MAT 13:29 “But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.
MAT 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”
MAT 13:31 He set another parable before them, saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;
MAT 13:32 which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.”
MAT 13:33 He spoke another parable to them. “The Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.”
MAT 13:34 Yeshua [Salvation] spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them,
MAT 13:35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”
MAT 13:36 Then Yeshua [Salvation] sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.”
MAT 13:37 He answered them, “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
MAT 13:38 the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.
MAT 13:39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil [Accuser]. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
MAT 13:40 As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.
MAT 13:41 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause people to sin ·scandal, trap snare, entrapment· and all the people who are far from Torah ·Teaching·, and those who do illegally ·to be without Torah (ignorant or intentional violation of law)·,
MAT 13:42 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
MAT 13:43 Then the upright will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·. He who has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·.
MAT 13:44 “Again, the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
MAT 13:45 “Again, the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,
MAT 13:46 who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
MAT 13:47 “Again, the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,
MAT 13:48 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.
MAT 13:49 So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the upright,
MAT 13:50 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.”
MAT 13:51 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Have you understood all these things?” They answered him, “Yes, Lord.”
MAT 13:52 He said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”
MAT 13:53 When Yeshua [Salvation] had finished these parables, he departed from there.
MAT 13:54 Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?
MAT 13:55 Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary [Rebellion], and his brothers, James [Surplanter], Joses, Simeon [Hearing], and Judas [Praised]?
MAT 13:56 Are not all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?”
MAT 13:57 They were scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· by him. But Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”
MAT 13:58 He didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
MAT 14:1 At that time, Herod [Heroic] the tetrarch (one of four co-emperors) heard the report concerning Yeshua [Salvation],
MAT 14:2 and said to his servants, “This is John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.”
MAT 14:3 For Herod [Heroic] had laid hold of John [Yah is gracious], and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip [Loves horses]’s wife.
MAT 14:4 For John [Yah is gracious] said to him, “It violates the Torah ·Teaching· for you to have her as your wife.”
MAT 14:5 When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
MAT 14:6 But when Herod [Heroic]’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod [Heroic].
MAT 14:7 There he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.
MAT 14:8 She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser.”
MAT 14:9 The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,
MAT 14:10 and he sent and beheaded John [Yah is gracious] in the prison.
MAT 14:11 His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.
MAT 14:12 His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Yeshua [Salvation].
MAT 14:13 Now when Yeshua [Salvation] heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
MAT 14:14 Yeshua [Salvation] went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
MAT 14:15 When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”
MAT 14:16 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
MAT 14:17 They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”
MAT 14:18 He said, “Bring them here to me.”
MAT 14:19 He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
MAT 14:20 They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.
MAT 14:21 Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT 14:22 Immediately Yeshua [Salvation] made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
MAT 14:23 After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.
MAT 14:24 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, a stadious’ distance [1/8 mi; 660 ft; 201.2 m, Greek race track distance], distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
MAT 14:25 It was about four o'clock in the morning, Yeshua [Salvation] came to them, walking on the sea.
MAT 14:26 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear.
MAT 14:27 But immediately Yeshua [Salvation] spoke to them, saying, “Take heart! Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)]! Don’t be afraid.”
MAT 14:28 Peter [Rock] answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.”
MAT 14:29 He said, “Come!” Peter [Rock] stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Yeshua [Salvation].
MAT 14:30 But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”
MAT 14:31 Immediately Yeshua [Salvation] stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, “You of little trusting faith, why did you doubt?”
MAT 14:32 When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
MAT 14:33 Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·!”
MAT 14:34 When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
MAT 14:35 When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick;
MAT 14:36 and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.
MAT 15:1 Then Pharisees [Separated] and Torah-Teachers came to Yeshua [Salvation] from Jerusalem [City of peace], saying,
MAT 15:2 “Why do your disciples disobey ·to be contrary, to violate and overstep command, to pass over without touching anything· the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”
MAT 15:3 He answered them, “Why do you also disobey ·to be contrary, to violate and overstep command, to pass over without touching anything· the commandment of God because of your tradition?
MAT 15:4 For God enjoins these words, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’
MAT 15:5 But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”
MAT 15:6 then he is rid of his duty to honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
MAT 15:7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] prophesy of you, saying,
MAT 15:8 ‘These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
MAT 15:9 In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”
MAT 15:10 He summoned the multitude, and said to them, “Hear, and understand.
MAT 15:11 That which enters into the mouth does not defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”
MAT 15:12 Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees [Separated] were scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, when they heard this saying?”
MAT 15:13 But he answered, “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.
MAT 15:14 Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
MAT 15:15 Peter [Rock] answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”
MAT 15:16 So Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Do you also still not understand?
MAT 15:17 Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
MAT 15:18 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.
MAT 15:19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, moicheiai ·adulteries·, porhneia ·sexual immorality·, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.
MAT 15:20 These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with ritually unwashed hands does not defile the man.”
MAT 15:21 Yeshua [Salvation] went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
MAT 15:22 Behold, a Canaanite [Descendant of Humbled] woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David [Beloved]! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”
MAT 15:23 But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”
MAT 15:24 But he answered, “I was not sent to just anyone but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel [God prevails].”
MAT 15:25 But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
MAT 15:26 But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”
MAT 15:27 But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
MAT 15:28 Then Yeshua [Salvation] answered her, “Woman, great is your trusting faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.
MAT 15:29 Yeshua [Salvation] departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee [District, Circuit]; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.
MAT 15:30 Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
MAT 15:31 so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing— and they glorified the God of Israel [God prevails].
MAT 15:32 Yeshua [Salvation] summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”
MAT 15:33 The disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”
MAT 15:34 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
MAT 15:35 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
MAT 15:36 and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
MAT 15:37 They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
MAT 15:38 Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT 15:39 Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
MAT 16:1 The Pharisees [Separated] and Sadducees [Morally-upright] came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
MAT 16:2 But he answered them, “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’
MAT 16:3 In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times!
MAT 16:4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah [Dove].” He left them, and departed.
MAT 16:5 The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.
MAT 16:6 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Take heed and beware of the hametz ·leaven· of the Pharisees [Separated] and Sadducees [Morally-upright].”
MAT 16:7 They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”
MAT 16:8 Yeshua [Salvation], perceiving it, said, “Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little trusting faith, ‘because you have brought no bread?’
MAT 16:9 Don’t you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
MAT 16:10 Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
MAT 16:11 How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the hametz ·leaven· of the Pharisees [Separated] and Sadducees [Morally-upright].”
MAT 16:12 Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the hametz ·leaven· of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees [Separated] and Sadducees [Morally-upright].
MAT 16:13 Now when Yeshua [Salvation] came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi [Ruler Loves horses], he asked his disciples, saying, “Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”
MAT 16:14 They said, “Some say John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser, some say Elijah [My God Yah], and others say Jeremiah [Yah lifts up], or one of the prophets.”
MAT 16:15 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”
MAT 16:16 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] answered, “You are the Messiah [Anointed one], haBen haElohim Chayim [the Son of the God Living].”
MAT 16:17 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Blessed are you, Simeon Bar Jonah [Hearing son of Dove], for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but 'Avi shebashamayim ·my Father in Heaven·.
MAT 16:18 I also tell you that you are Peter [Rock], and on this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades / Sh'ol ·Place of the dead· will not prevail against it.
MAT 16:19 I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven (God), and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”
MAT 16:20 Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Yeshua the Messiah [Salvation the Anointed one].
MAT 16:21 From that time, Yeshua [Salvation] began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem [City of peace] and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and Torah-Teachers, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
MAT 16:22 Peter [Rock] took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.”
MAT 16:23 But he turned, and said to Peter [Rock], “Get behind me, Satan [Adversary]! You are a sin ·scandal, trap snare, entrapment· to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.”
MAT 16:24 Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to his disciples, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his execution-stake, and follow me.
MAT 16:25 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.
MAT 16:26 For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?
MAT 16:27 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of 'Aviv ·his Father· with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds.
MAT 16:28 Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.”
MAT 17:1 After six days, Yeshua [Salvation] took with him Peter [Rock], James [Surplanter], and John [Yah is gracious] his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
MAT 17:2 He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light.
MAT 17:3 Behold, Moses [Drawn out] and Elijah [My God Yah] appeared to them talking with him.
MAT 17:4 Peter [Rock] answered, and said to Yeshua [Salvation], “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses [Drawn out], and one for Elijah [My God Yah].”
MAT 17:5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”
MAT 17:6 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
MAT 17:7 Yeshua [Salvation] came and touched them and said, “Get up, and don’t be afraid.”
MAT 17:8 Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Yeshua [Salvation] alone.
MAT 17:9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Yeshua [Salvation] enjoined them, saying, “Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
MAT 17:10 His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the Torah-Teachers say that Elijah [My God Yah] must come first?”
MAT 17:11 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Elijah [My God Yah] indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
MAT 17:12 but I tell you that Elijah [My God Yah] has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.”
MAT 17:13 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser.
MAT 17:14 When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, and saying,
MAT 17:15 “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
MAT 17:16 So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.”
MAT 17:17 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”
MAT 17:18 Yeshua [Salvation] rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
MAT 17:19 Then the disciples came to Yeshua [Salvation] privately, and said, “Why were we not able to cast it out?”
MAT 17:20 He said to them, “Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have trusting faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.
MAT 17:21 But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.”
MAT 17:22 While they were staying in Galilee [District, Circuit], Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,
MAT 17:23 and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.” They were exceedingly sorry.
MAT 17:24 When they had come to Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], those who collected the half-shekel coin came to Peter [Rock], and said, “Does not your Rabbi ·Teacher· pay the Temple Tax?”
MAT 17:25 He said, “Yes.” When he came into the house, Yeshua [Salvation] anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simeon [Hearing]? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”
MAT 17:26 Peter [Rock] said to him, “From strangers.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Therefore the children are exempt.
MAT 17:27 But, lest we cause them to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a shekel [0.4 oz; 11.34 kg]. Take that, and give it to them for me and you.”
MAT 18:1 In that hour the disciples came to Yeshua [Salvation], saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven (God)?”
MAT 18:2 Yeshua [Salvation] called a little child to himself, and set him in the middle of them,
MAT 18:3 and said, “Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven (God).
MAT 18:4 Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven (God).
MAT 18:5 Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,
MAT 18:6 but whoever causes one of these little ones who trust in me to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· , it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea.
MAT 18:7 “Woe to the world because of occasions of sin ·scandal, trap snare, entrapment·! For it must be that the sins ·scandals, trap snares, entrapments· come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!
MAT 18:8 If your hand or your foot causes you to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
MAT 18:9 If your eye causes you to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead) of fire.
MAT 18:10 See that you don’t despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of 'Avi shebashamayim ·my Father in Heaven·.
MAT 18:11 For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
MAT 18:12 “What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does not he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
MAT 18:13 If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
MAT 18:14 Even so it is not the will of 'Avikah shebashamayim ·your Father in Heaven· that one of these little ones should perish.
MAT 18:15 “If your brother commits sin ·miss the mark and be without share· against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.
MAT 18:16 But if he does not listen, take one or two more with you so that every accusation can be supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
MAT 18:17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.
MAT 18:18 Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
MAT 18:19 Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by 'Avi shebashamayim ·my Father in Heaven·.
MAT 18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the middle of them.”
MAT 18:21 Then Peter [Rock] came and said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, how often shall my brother commit sin ·miss the mark and be without share· against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?”
MAT 18:22 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.
MAT 18:23 Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.
MAT 18:24 When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
MAT 18:25 But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
MAT 18:26 The servant therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’
MAT 18:27 The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
MAT 18:28 “But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii (100 days wages), and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’
MAT 18:29 “So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’
MAT 18:30 He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.
MAT 18:31 So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.
MAT 18:32 Then his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
MAT 18:33 Should not you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’
MAT 18:34 His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.
MAT 18:35 So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his lapse and deviation from truth.”
MAT 19:1 When Yeshua [Salvation] had finished these words, he departed from Galilee [District, Circuit], and came into the borders of Judea [Praise] beyond the Jordan [Descender].
MAT 19:2 Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT 19:3 Pharisees [Separated] came to him, testing him, and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
MAT 19:4 He answered, “Haven’t you read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female,
MAT 19:5 and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh’ ?
MAT 19:6 So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.”
MAT 19:7 They asked him, “Why then did Moses [Drawn out] enjoin us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?”
MAT 19:8 He said to them, “Moses [Drawn out], because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.
MAT 19:9 I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for porhneia ·sexual immorality·, and marries another, commits moichao ·act of adultery·; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits moichao ·act of adultery·.”
MAT 19:10 His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.”
MAT 19:11 But he said to them, “Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.
MAT 19:12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s (God’s) sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.”
MAT 19:13 Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
MAT 19:14 But Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Allow the little children, and don’t forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven (God) belongs to ones like these.”
MAT 19:15 He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.
MAT 19:16 Behold, one came to him and said, “Good Rabbi ·Teacher·, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?”
MAT 19:17 He said to him, “Why do you call me good? There is One who is good, that is God’s Torah ·Teaching·. But if you want to enter into life, observe the mitzvot ·instructions·.”
MAT 19:18 He said to him, “Which ones?” Yeshua [Salvation] said, “‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall not moicheuo ·commit adultery·.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not offer false testimony.’
MAT 19:19 ‘Honor your father and your mother.’ And, ‘You shall show agapao ·total devoted love· to your neighbor as yourself.’”
MAT 19:20 The young man said to him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?”
MAT 19:21 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”
MAT 19:22 But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.
MAT 19:23 Yeshua [Salvation] said to his disciples, “Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven (God) with difficulty.
MAT 19:24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye (small door of city gate), than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”
MAT 19:25 When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”
MAT 19:26 Looking at them, Yeshua [Salvation] said, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
MAT 19:27 Then Peter [Rock] answered, “Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?”
MAT 19:28 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel [God prevails].
MAT 19:29 Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.
MAT 19:30 But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.
MAT 20:1 “For the Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
MAT 20:2 When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius [one day’s wage] a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
MAT 20:3 He went out about nine in the morning, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
MAT 20:4 He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went their way.
MAT 20:5 Again he went out about noon and three in the afternoon, and did likewise.
MAT 20:6 About a hour before sunset he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, ‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’
MAT 20:7 “They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ “He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’
MAT 20:8 When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’
MAT 20:9 “When those who were hired a hour before sunset came, they each received a denarius [one day’s wage].
MAT 20:10 When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius [one day’s wage].
MAT 20:11 When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,
MAT 20:12 saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’
MAT 20:13 “But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no unjust criminal action sin ·miss the mark and is without share in the goal·. Didn’t you agree with me for a denarius [one day’s wage]?
MAT 20:14 Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
MAT 20:15 Is not it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good? Do you begrudge my generosity?’
MAT 20:16 So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.”
MAT 20:17 As Yeshua [Salvation] was going up to Jerusalem [City of peace], he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
MAT 20:18 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem [City of peace], and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and Torah-Teachers, and they will condemn him to death,
MAT 20:19 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up.”
MAT 20:20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah] came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.
MAT 20:21 He said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.”
MAT 20:22 But Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with?” They said to him, “We are able.”
MAT 20:23 He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with, but to sit at my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by 'Avi ·my Father·.”
MAT 20:24 When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
MAT 20:25 But Yeshua [Salvation] summoned them, and said, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
MAT 20:26 It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.
MAT 20:27 Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bond-servant,
MAT 20:28 even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
MAT 20:29 As they went out from Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], a great multitude followed him.
MAT 20:30 Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Yeshua [Salvation] was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David [Beloved]!”
MAT 20:31 The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David [Beloved]!”
MAT 20:32 Yeshua [Salvation] stood still, and called them, and asked, “What do you want me to do for you?”
MAT 20:33 They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”
MAT 20:34 Yeshua [Salvation], being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him.
MAT 21:1 When they came near to Jerusalem [City of peace] (at the beginning of the first month ofNissan ·Miracles (in Aramaic), 1·), and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Yeshua [Salvation] sent two disciples,
MAT 21:2 saying to them, “Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me.
MAT 21:3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”
MAT 21:4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
MAT 21:5 “Tell the daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking], behold, your King comes to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”
MAT 21:6 The disciples went, and did just as Yeshua [Salvation] commanded them,
MAT 21:7 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.
MAT 21:8 A very great multitude carpeted the road with their clothing, while others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.
MAT 21:9 The multitudes who went in front of him, and those who followed, kept shouting, “ Hosanna ·Save now· to the son of David [Beloved]! Blessed is he who comes in the name of MarYah [Master Yahweh]! Hosanna ·Save now· in the highest!”
MAT 21:10 When he had come into Jerusalem [City of peace], all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”
MAT 21:11 The multitudes said, “This is the prophet (promised Messiah), Yeshua [Salvation], from Nazareth [Branch, Separated one] of Galilee [District, Circuit].”
MAT 21:12 Yeshua [Salvation] entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
MAT 21:13 He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it a den of robbers!”
MAT 21:14 The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
MAT 21:15 But when the chief priests and the Torah-Teachers saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, “ Hosanna ·Save now· to the son of David [Beloved]!” they were indignant,
MAT 21:16 and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Yes. Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?’”
MAT 21:17 He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany [House of affliction], and camped there.
MAT 21:18 Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
MAT 21:19 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, “Let there be no fruit from you forever!” Immediately the fig tree withered away.
MAT 21:20 When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”
MAT 21:21 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Most certainly I tell you, if you have trusting faith, and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.
MAT 21:22 All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”
MAT 21:23 When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
MAT 21:24 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAT 21:25 The mikvah ·ritual washing baptism· of John [Yah is gracious], where was it from? From heaven or from men?” They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not trust him?’
MAT 21:26 But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John [Yah is gracious] as a prophet.”
MAT 21:27 They answered Yeshua [Salvation], and said, “We don’t know.” He also said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAT 21:28 But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’
MAT 21:29 He answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he had remorse ·to care afterwards, regret into repent·, changed his mind, and went.
MAT 21:30 He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but he didn’t go.
MAT 21:31 Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said to him, “The first.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you.
MAT 21:32 For John [Yah is gracious] came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t trust him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes trusted him. When you saw it, you didn’t even have remorse ·to care afterwards, regret into repent· or teshuvah ·turn repent· afterward, that you might trust him.
MAT 21:33 “Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a wall about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.
MAT 21:34 When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
MAT 21:35 The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
MAT 21:36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.
MAT 21:37 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
MAT 21:38 But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and seize his inheritance.’
MAT 21:39 So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
MAT 21:40 When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”
MAT 21:41 They told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season.”
MAT 21:42 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner. This was from Adonai . It is marvelous in our eyes?’
MAT 21:43 “Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing its fruit.
MAT 21:44 He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but if it falls on him, he will crushed to dust.”
MAT 21:45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees [Separated] heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.
MAT 21:46 When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.
MAT 22:1 Yeshua [Salvation] answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
MAT 22:2 “The Kingdom of Heaven (God) is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
MAT 22:3 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.
MAT 22:4 Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!”’
MAT 22:5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,
MAT 22:6 and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
MAT 22:7 When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
MAT 22:8 “Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
MAT 22:9 Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.’
MAT 22:10 Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.
MAT 22:11 But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing,
MAT 22:12 and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless.
MAT 22:13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’
MAT 22:14 For many are called, but few chosen.”
MAT 22:15 Then the Pharisees [Separated] went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.
MAT 22:16 They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you are not partial to anyone.
MAT 22:17 Tell us what you think: Does Torah ·Teaching· permit paying taxes to Caesar [Ruler], or not?”
MAT 22:18 But Yeshua [Salvation] perceived their wickedness, and said, “Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
MAT 22:19 Show me the tax money.” They brought to him a denarius [one day’s wage].
MAT 22:20 He asked them, “Whose is this image and inscription?”
MAT 22:21 They said to him, “Caesar’s [Ruler]’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to Caesar [Ruler] the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
MAT 22:22 When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.
MAT 22:23 On that day Sadducees [Morally-upright] (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him hard questions,
MAT 22:24 saying, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, Moses [Drawn out] said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’
MAT 22:25 Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.
MAT 22:26 In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
MAT 22:27 After them all, the woman died.
MAT 22:28 In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”
MAT 22:29 But Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
MAT 22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven.
MAT 22:31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
MAT 22:32 ‘I am the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], and the God of Isaac [Laughter], and the God of Jacob [Supplanter]?’ God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”
MAT 22:33 When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
MAT 22:34 But the Pharisees [Separated], when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees [Morally-upright], gathered themselves together.
MAT 22:35 One of them, a Torah-expert, asked him a question, testing him.
MAT 22:36 “Rabbi ·Teacher·, which of the mitzvot ·instructions· in the Torah ·Teaching· is the most important?”
MAT 22:37 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “‘You shall have agapao ·total devotion love· to MarYah [Master Yahweh] your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’
MAT 22:38 This is the greatest and most important mitzvah ·instruction·.
MAT 22:39 A second likewise is this, ‘You shall show agapao ·total devoted love· to your neighbor as yourself.’
MAT 22:40 All of the Torah ·Teaching· and the Prophets depend on these two mitzvot ·instructions·.”
MAT 22:41 Now while the Pharisees [Separated] were gathered together, Yeshua [Salvation] asked them a question,
MAT 22:42 saying, “What do you think of the Messiah [Anointed one]? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “Of David [Beloved].”
MAT 22:43 He said to them, “How then does David [Beloved] in haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] call him MarYah [Master Yahweh], saying,
MAT 22:44 ‘Yahweh said to 'adoni ·my Lord·, sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet’ ?
MAT 22:45 “If then David [Beloved] calls him MarYah [Master Yahweh], in what way can he be his son?”
MAT 22:46 No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more hard questions from that day forward.
MAT 23:1 Then Yeshua [Salvation] spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
MAT 23:2 saying, “The Torah-Teachers and the Pharisees [Separated] sat on Moses [Drawn out]’ seat.
MAT 23:3 All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don’t do their works; for they say, and don’t do.
MAT 23:4 For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them.
MAT 23:5 But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, enlarge the tzitziyot ·tassles· of their garments,
MAT 23:6 and phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,
MAT 23:7 the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi ·Teacher·' by men.
MAT 23:8 But don’t you be called ‘Rabbi ·Teacher·,’ for one is your Rabbi ·Teacher·, the Messiah [Anointed one], and all of you are brothers.
MAT 23:9 Call no man on the earth 'Avikah ·your Father·, for one is 'Avikah ·your Father·, he who is in heaven.
MAT 23:10 Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Messiah [Anointed one].
MAT 23:11 But he who is greatest among you will be your servant.
MAT 23:12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
MAT 23:13 “Woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
MAT 23:14 “But woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven (God) against men; for you don’t enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter.
MAT 23:15 Woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one convert; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead) as yourselves.
MAT 23:16 “Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.’
MAT 23:17 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
MAT 23:18 ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?’
MAT 23:19 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
MAT 23:20 He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.
MAT 23:21 He who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who was living in it.
MAT 23:22 He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.
MAT 23:23 “Woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the Torah ·Teaching·: justice, eleos ·merciful compassion in action·, and faithfulness. These are the things you should have attended to, without neglecting the others!
MAT 23:24 You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
MAT 23:25 “Woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.
MAT 23:26 You blind Pharisee [Separated], first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also.
MAT 23:27 “Woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
MAT 23:28 Even so you also outwardly appear upright to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and illegally ·to be without Torah ·Teaching· (ignorant or intentional violation of law)·.
MAT 23:29 “Woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the upright,
MAT 23:30 and say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn’t have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.’
MAT 23:31 Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.
MAT 23:32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
MAT 23:33 You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead)?
MAT 23:34 Therefore behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and Torah-Teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
MAT 23:35 that on you may come all the upright blood shed on the earth, from the blood of upright Abel [Vanity, Mourning] to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
MAT 23:36 Most certainly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.
MAT 23:37 “Jerusalem [City of peace], Jerusalem [City of peace], who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!
MAT 23:38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
MAT 23:39 For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of MarYah [Master Yahweh]!’”
MAT 24:1 Yeshua [Salvation] went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
MAT 24:2 But he answered them, “You see all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.”
MAT 24:3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?”
MAT 24:4 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.
MAT 24:5 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], the Messiah [Anointed one],’ and will lead many astray.
MAT 24:6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.
MAT 24:7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.
MAT 24:8 But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
MAT 24:9 Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name’s sake.
MAT 24:10 Then many will be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.
MAT 24:11 Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.
MAT 24:12 Because of increased illegally ·to be without Torah ·Teaching· (ignorant or intentional violation of law)·, many people’s agape ·unconditional love· will grow cold.
MAT 24:13 But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
MAT 24:14 This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
MAT 24:15 “When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel [My judge is God] the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
MAT 24:16 then let those who are in Judea [Praise] flee to the mountains.
MAT 24:17 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house.
MAT 24:18 Let him who is in the field not teshuvah ·completely return· back to get his clothes.
MAT 24:19 But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!
MAT 24:20 Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath ·To cease·,
MAT 24:21 for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
MAT 24:22 Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.
MAT 24:23 “Then if any man tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Messiah [Anointed one],’ or, ‘There,’ don’t trust it.
MAT 24:24 For there will arise false Messiahs [Anointed ones], and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
MAT 24:25 “Behold, I have told you beforehand.
MAT 24:26 If therefore they tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ don’t go out; ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ don’t trust it.
MAT 24:27 For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
MAT 24:28 For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together.
MAT 24:29 But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;
MAT 24:30 and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
MAT 24:31 He will send out his angels with a great sound of a shofar ·ram horn·, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
MAT 24:32 “Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and produces its leaves, you know that the summer is near.
MAT 24:33 Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
MAT 24:34 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.
MAT 24:35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
MAT 24:36 But when that day and hour will come, no one knows— not the angels in heaven, not the Son, only Abba Father.
MAT 24:37 “For the Son of Man’s coming will be just as it was in the days of Noah [Rest].
MAT 24:38 For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah [Rest] entered into the ship,
MAT 24:39 and they didn’t know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
MAT 24:40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left;
MAT 24:41 two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left.
MAT 24:42 Watch therefore, for you don’t know in what hour your Lord comes.
MAT 24:43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
MAT 24:44 Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don’t expect, the Son of Man will come.
MAT 24:45 “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
MAT 24:46 Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.
MAT 24:47 Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.
MAT 24:48 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his coming,’
MAT 24:49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,
MAT 24:50 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not expect it, and in an hour when he does not know it,
MAT 24:51 and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.
MAT 25:1 “Then the Kingdom of Heaven (God) will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.
MAT 25:2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
MAT 25:3 Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,
MAT 25:4 but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.
MAT 25:5 Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
MAT 25:6 But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’
MAT 25:7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
MAT 25:8 The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’
MAT 25:9 But the wise answered, saying, ‘What if there is not enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’
MAT 25:10 While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
MAT 25:11 Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Master, Lord, open to us.’
MAT 25:12 But he answered, ‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
MAT 25:13 Watch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
MAT 25:14 “For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.
MAT 25:15 To one he gave five talents [30,000 denarii; 2,587 lb; 117 kg], to another two talents [12,000 denarii; 1,035 lb; 46.8 kg], to another one talent [6,000 denarii; 517.5 lb; 23.4 kg]; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.
MAT 25:16 Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
MAT 25:17 In the same way, he also who got the two talents gained another two talents.
MAT 25:18 But he who received the one talent [6,000 denarii; 517.5 lb; 23.4 kg] went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
MAT 25:19 “Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.
MAT 25:20 He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents [30,000 denarii; 2,587 lb; 117 kg]. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them [a total of 60,000 denarii; 5,175 lb; 234 kg].’
MAT 25:21 “His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’
MAT 25:22 “He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents [12,000 denarii; 1,035 lb; 46.8 kg]. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them [a total of 24,000 denarii; 2,070 lb; 93.6 kg].’
MAT 25:23 “His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’
MAT 25:24 “He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
MAT 25:25 I was afraid, and went away and hid your single talent [6,000 denarii; 517.5 lb; 23.4 kg] in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’
MAT 25:26 “But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter.
MAT 25:27 You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.
MAT 25:28 Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.
MAT 25:29 For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.
MAT 25:30 Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
MAT 25:31 “But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
MAT 25:32 Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
MAT 25:33 He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
MAT 25:34 Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of 'Avi ·my Father·, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
MAT 25:35 for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.
MAT 25:36 I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.’
MAT 25:37 “Then the upright will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
MAT 25:38 When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?
MAT 25:39 When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?’
MAT 25:40 “The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’
MAT 25:41 Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil [Accuser] and his angels;
MAT 25:42 for I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
MAT 25:43 I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’
MAT 25:44 “Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’
MAT 25:45 “Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you didn’t do it to one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’
MAT 25:46 These will go away into eternal punishment, but the upright into eternal life.”
MAT 26:1 When Yeshua [Salvation] had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
MAT 26:2 “You know that the Pesac ·Passover· is two days away (Nissan 12), and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be nailed to the execution-stake.”
MAT 26:3 Then the chief priests, the Torah-Teachers, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out].
MAT 26:4 They took counsel together that they might take Yeshua [Salvation] by deceit, and kill him.
MAT 26:5 But they said, “Not during the festival of Passover, lest a riot occur among the people.”
MAT 26:6 Now when Yeshua [Salvation] was in Bethany [House of affliction], in the house of Simeon [Hearing] the leper,
MAT 26:7 a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.
MAT 26:8 But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste?
MAT 26:9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.”
MAT 26:10 However, knowing this, Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me.
MAT 26:11 For you always have the poor with you; but you don’t always have me.
MAT 26:12 For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
MAT 26:13 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”
MAT 26:14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot [Praised Dagger-man], went to the chief priests,
MAT 26:15 and said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.
MAT 26:16 From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
MAT 26:17 Now on the first of Matzah ·Unleavened bread· (Nissan 14), the disciples came to Yeshua [Salvation], saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare your Seder ·Order / Passover meal·?”
MAT 26:18 He said, “Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Rabbi ·Teacher· says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Pesac ·Passover· at your house with my disciples.”’”
MAT 26:19 The disciples did as Yeshua [Salvation] commanded them, and they prepared the Seder ·Order / Passover meal·.
MAT 26:20 Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
MAT 26:21 As they were eating, he said, “Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”
MAT 26:22 They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It is not me, is it, Lord?”
MAT 26:23 He answered, “He who dipped his matzah ·unleavened bread· with me in the dish (of bitter herbs), the same will betray me.
MAT 26:24 The Son of Man will die just as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”
MAT 26:25 Judas [Praised], who betrayed him, answered, “It is not me, is it, Rabbi ·Teacher·?” He said to him, “You said it.”
MAT 26:26 As they were eating, Yeshua [Salvation] took matzah ·unleavened bread·, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
MAT 26:27 He took the (third) cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, “All of you drink it,
MAT 26:28 for this is my blood of the new covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, which is poured out for many for the remission of abstract sins ·miss the marks·.
MAT 26:29 But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in 'Avi ·my Father·’s Kingdom.”
MAT 26:30 When they had sung the Hallel Psalms [Praise Praises], they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT 26:31 Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “All of you will be made to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
MAT 26:32 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee [District, Circuit].”
MAT 26:33 But Peter [Rock] answered him, “Even if all men feel scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· because of you, I will never be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, never.”
MAT 26:34 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”
MAT 26:35 Peter [Rock] said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise.
MAT 26:36 Then Yeshua [Salvation] came with them to a place called Gethsemane [Olive oil press], and said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go there and pray.”
MAT 26:37 He took with him Peter [Rock] and the two sons of Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah], and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
MAT 26:38 Then he said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”
MAT 26:39 He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, “ 'Avi ·my Father·, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”
MAT 26:40 He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter [Rock], “What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour?
MAT 26:41 Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
MAT 26:42 Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, “'Avi ·my Father·, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.”
MAT 26:43 He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
MAT 26:44 He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
MAT 26:45 Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, “Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·.
MAT 26:46 Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”
MAT 26:47 While he was still speaking, behold, Judas [Praised], one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with machairon ·machetes, small sword knives· and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
MAT 26:48 Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I phileo ·affectionately love, kiss·, he is the one. Seize him.”
MAT 26:49 Immediately he came to Yeshua [Salvation], and said, “ Shalom ·Complete peace·, Rabbi ·Teacher·!” and kissed him.
MAT 26:50 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid hands on Yeshua [Salvation], and took him.
MAT 26:51 Behold, one of those who were with Yeshua [Salvation] stretched out his hand, and drew his machaira ·machete, small sword knife·, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
MAT 26:52 Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Put your machaira ·machete, small sword knife· back into its place, for all those who take the machaira ·machete, small sword knife· will die by the machaira ·machete, small sword knife·.
MAT 26:53 Or do you think that I couldn’t ask 'Avi ·my Father·, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
MAT 26:54 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?”
MAT 26:55 In that hour Yeshua [Salvation] said to the multitudes, “Have you come out as against a robber with machairon ·machetes, small sword knives· and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me.
MAT 26:56 But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
MAT 26:57 Those who had taken Yeshua [Salvation] led him away to Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out] the high priest, where the Torah-Teachers and the elders were gathered together.
MAT 26:58 But Peter [Rock] followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.
MAT 26:59 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Yeshua [Salvation], that they might put him to death;
MAT 26:60 and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,
MAT 26:61 and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”
MAT 26:62 The high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?”
MAT 26:63 But Yeshua [Salvation] held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the Elohim Chayim [Living God], that you tell us whether you are the Messiah [Anointed one], the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.”
MAT 26:64 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”
MAT 26:65 Then the high priest tore his, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.
MAT 26:66 What do you think?” They answered, “He is worthy of death!”
MAT 26:67 Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,
MAT 26:68 saying, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah [Anointed one]! Who hit you?”
MAT 26:69 Now Peter [Rock] was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Yeshua [Salvation], the Galilean!”
MAT 26:70 But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”
MAT 26:71 When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Yeshua [Salvation] of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one].”
MAT 26:72 Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.”
MAT 26:73 After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter [Rock], “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.”
MAT 26:74 Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” Immediately the rooster crowed.
MAT 26:75 Peter [Rock] remembered the word which Yeshua [Salvation] had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and wept bitterly.
MAT 27:1 Now early in the morning (Nissan 14), all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Yeshua [Salvation] to put him to death:
MAT 27:2 and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate [Armed with javelin], the governor.
MAT 27:3 Then Judas [Praised], who betrayed him, when he saw that Yeshua [Salvation] was condemned, felt remorse ·to care afterwards, regret into repent·, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
MAT 27:4 saying, “I have committed sin ·missed the mark and being without share· in that I betrayed innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”
MAT 27:5 He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.
MAT 27:6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”
MAT 27:7 They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in.
MAT 27:8 Therefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day.
MAT 27:9 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah [Yah lifts up] the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “They took the thirty pieces of silver, which was the price the people of Israel [God prevails] had agreed to pay him,
MAT 27:10 and used them to buy the potter’s field just as MarYah [Master Yahweh] commanded me.”
MAT 27:11 Now Yeshua [Salvation] stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews [Praisers]?” Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “So you say.”
MAT 27:12 When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
MAT 27:13 Then Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”
MAT 27:14 He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
MAT 27:15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.
MAT 27:16 They had then a notable prisoner, called Bar-Abba [Son Father].
MAT 27:17 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Bar-Abba [Son Father], or Yeshua [Salvation], who is called Messiah [Anointed one]?”
MAT 27:18 For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
MAT 27:19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that upright man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”
MAT 27:20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Bar-Abba [Son Father], and destroy Yeshua [Salvation].
MAT 27:21 But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” They said, “Bar-Abba [Son Father]!”
MAT 27:22 Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “What then shall I do to Yeshua [Salvation], who is called Messiah [Anointed one]?” They all said to him, “Put him to death on the stake!”
MAT 27:23 But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Death on the stake!”
MAT 27:24 So when Pilate [Armed with javelin] saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this upright person. You see to it.”
MAT 27:25 All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”
MAT 27:26 Then he released to them Bar-Abba [Son Father], but Yeshua [Salvation] he flogged and delivered to be nailed to the execution-stake.
MAT 27:27 Then the governor’s soldiers took Yeshua [Salvation] into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.
MAT 27:28 They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.
MAT 27:29 They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they knelt down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews [Praisers]!”
MAT 27:30 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.
MAT 27:31 When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
MAT 27:32 As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simeon [Hearing] by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his execution-stake.
MAT 27:33 When they came to a place called “Golgotha ,” that means, “[The place of a skull],”
MAT 27:34 they gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
MAT 27:35 When they had nailed him to the stake, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,
MAT 27:36 and they sat and watched him there.
MAT 27:37 They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “This Is Yeshua [Salvation], The King of The Jews [Praisers].”
MAT 27:38 Then there were two robbers placed on execution-stakes with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.
MAT 27:39 Those who passed by blasphemed him, shaking their heads,
MAT 27:40 and saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·, come down from the execution-stake!”
MAT 27:41 Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the Torah-Teachers, the Pharisees [Separated], and the elders, said,
MAT 27:42 “He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the Melek Isra'el [King of God prevails], let him come down from the execution-stake now, and we will trust in him.
MAT 27:43 He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.’”
MAT 27:44 The robbers also who were placed on execution-stakes with him cast on him the same reproach.
MAT 27:45 Now from noon until three o'clock there was darkness over all the land.
MAT 27:46 About three o'clock in the afternoon, Yeshua [Salvation] cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?” That is, “·My God, my God, why have you forsaken me·?”
MAT 27:47 Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah [My God Yah].”
MAT 27:48 Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
MAT 27:49 The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah [My God Yah] comes to save him.”
MAT 27:50 Yeshua [Salvation] cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
MAT 27:51 Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
MAT 27:52 The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
MAT 27:53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
MAT 27:54 Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Yeshua [Salvation], when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.”
MAT 27:55 Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Yeshua [Salvation] from Galilee [District, Circuit], serving him.
MAT 27:56 Among them were Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower], Mary [Rebellion] the mother of James [Surplanter] and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah].
MAT 27:57 When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph [May he add], who himself was also Yeshua's [Salvation]'s disciple came.
MAT 27:58 This man went to Pilate [Armed with javelin], and asked for Yeshua [Salvation]’s body (Nissan 14). Then Pilate [Armed with javelin] commanded the body to be given up.
MAT 27:59 Joseph [May he add] took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
MAT 27:60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
MAT 27:61 Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower] was there, and the other Mary [Rebellion], sitting opposite the tomb.
MAT 27:62 Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day (Nissan 15), the chief priests and the Pharisees [Separated] were gathered together to Pilate [Armed with javelin],
MAT 27:63 saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’
MAT 27:64 Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last sin ·abstractly deceive, straying from orthodox beliefs· will be worse than the first.”
MAT 27:65 Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”
MAT 27:66 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
MAT 28:1 Now after the second Sabbath ·To cease· (Nissan 17), it was the first day of the week, (the day of First Fruits #1), and it was starting to dawn, Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower] and the other Mary [Rebellion] came to see the tomb.
MAT 28:2 Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of MarYah [Master Yahweh] descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
MAT 28:3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
MAT 28:4 For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.
MAT 28:5 The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Yeshua [Salvation], who was executed on the stake.
MAT 28:6 He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Master was lying.
MAT 28:7 Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee [District, Circuit]; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”
MAT 28:8 They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
MAT 28:9 As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Yeshua [Salvation] met them, saying, “Shalom ·Complete peace·!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
MAT 28:10 Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee [District, Circuit], and there they will see me.”
MAT 28:11 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.
MAT 28:12 When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
MAT 28:13 saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
MAT 28:14 If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”
MAT 28:15 So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews [Praisers], and continues until today.
MAT 28:16 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee [District, Circuit], to the mountain where Yeshua [Salvation] had sent them.
MAT 28:17 When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.
MAT 28:18 Yeshua [Salvation] came to them and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
MAT 28:19 Go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Abba ·Father· and of the Son and of Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness],
MAT 28:20 teaching them to observe all things that I have enjoined unto you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen ·So be it·.
MAR 1:1 The beginning of the Good News of Yeshua Messiah [Salvation Anointed one], the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.
MAR 1:2 As it is written in the prophets, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you:
MAR 1:3 the voice of one crys out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of MarYah [Master Yahweh]! Make his paths straight!’”
MAR 1:4 John [Yah is gracious] came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the mikvah ·ritual washing baptism· of teshuvah ·complete repentance· for forgiveness of abstract sins ·miss the marks·.
MAR 1:5 All the country of Judea [Praise] and all those of Jerusalem [City of peace] went out to him. They were immersed by him in the Jordan [Descender] river, confessing their abstract sins ·miss the marks·.
MAR 1:6 John [Yah is gracious] was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
MAR 1:7 He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.
MAR 1:8 I immersed you in water, but he will mikvah ·baptise· you in Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness].”
MAR 1:9 In those days, Yeshua [Salvation] came from Nazareth [Branch, Separated one] of Galilee [District, Circuit], and was immersed by John [Yah is gracious] in the Jordan [Descender].
MAR 1:10 Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] descending on him like a dove.
MAR 1:11 A voice came out of the sky, “You are my agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
MAR 1:12 Immediately haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] drove him out into the wilderness.
MAR 1:13 He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan [Adversary]. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.
MAR 1:14 Now after John [Yah is gracious] was taken into custody, Yeshua [Salvation] came into Galilee [District, Circuit], preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom,
MAR 1:15 and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Teshuvah ·Turn repent·, and trust in the Good News.”
MAR 1:16 Passing along by the sea of Galilee [District, Circuit], he saw Simeon [Hearing] and Andrew [Manly] the brother of Simeon [Hearing] casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
MAR 1:17 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”
MAR 1:18 Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
MAR 1:19 Going on a little further from there, he saw James son of Zebedee [Surplanter son of Yah Has Bestowed], and John [Yah is gracious], his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
MAR 1:20 Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah], in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
MAR 1:21 They went into Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], and immediately on the Sabbath ·To cease· day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
MAR 1:22 They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the Torah-Teachers.
MAR 1:23 Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
MAR 1:24 saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Yeshua [Salvation], you Nazarene [person from Branch, Separated one]? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: haKadosh Elohim [the Holy One of God]!”
MAR 1:25 Yeshua [Salvation] rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”
MAR 1:26 The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
MAR 1:27 They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”
MAR 1:28 The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee [District, Circuit] and its surrounding area.
MAR 1:29 Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simeon [Hearing] and Andrew [Manly], with James [Surplanter] and John [Yah is gracious].
MAR 1:30 Now Simeon [Hearing]’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
MAR 1:31 He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.
MAR 1:32 At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons.
MAR 1:33 All the city was gathered together at the door.
MAR 1:34 He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.
MAR 1:35 Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.
MAR 1:36 Simeon [Hearing] and those who were with him followed after him;
MAR 1:37 and they found him, and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”
MAR 1:38 He said to them, “Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”
MAR 1:39 He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee [District, Circuit], preaching and casting out demons.
MAR 1:40 A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”
MAR 1:41 Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, “I want to. Be made clean.”
MAR 1:42 When he had said this, immediately the tzara'at ·leprosy· departed from him, and he was made clean.
MAR 1:43 He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,
MAR 1:44 and said to him, “See you say nothing to anybody; instead, as a testimony to the people, go and let the priest examine you, and make an offer for your cleansing, as Moses [Drawn out] commanded.”
MAR 1:45 But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Yeshua [Salvation] could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.
MAR 2:1 When he entered again into Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion] after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.
MAR 2:2 Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.
MAR 2:3 Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.
MAR 2:4 When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.
MAR 2:5 Yeshua [Salvation], seeing their trusting faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, your abstract sins ·miss the marks· are forgiven you.”
MAR 2:6 But there were some of the Torah-Teachers sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
MAR 2:7 “Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive abstract sins ·miss the marks· but God alone?”
MAR 2:8 Immediately Yeshua [Salvation], perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
MAR 2:9 Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your abstract sins ·miss the marks· are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?’
MAR 2:10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive abstract sins ·miss the marks·”— he said to the paralytic—
MAR 2:11 “I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.”
MAR 2:12 He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”
MAR 2:13 He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
MAR 2:14 As he passed by, he saw Levi [United with], the son of Alphaeus [Changing], sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he arose and followed him.
MAR 2:15 He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· sat down with Yeshua [Salvation] and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.
MAR 2:16 The Torah-Teachers and the Pharisees [Separated], when they saw that he was eating with the sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·?”
MAR 2:17 When Yeshua [Salvation] heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the upright, but sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· to teshuvah ·complete repentance·.”
MAR 2:18 John [Yah is gracious]’s disciples and the Pharisees [Separated] were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do John [Yah is gracious]’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees [Separated] fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”
MAR 2:19 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.
MAR 2:20 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.
MAR 2:21 No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.
MAR 2:22 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins.”
MAR 2:23 He was going on the Sabbath ·To cease· day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.
MAR 2:24 The Pharisees [Separated] said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath ·To cease· day?”
MAR 2:25 He said to them, “Did you never read what David [Beloved] did, when he had need, and was hungry— he, and those who were with him?
MAR 2:26 How he entered into God’s house when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread from the altar of Yahweh, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”
MAR 2:27 He said to them, “The Sabbath ·To cease· was made for man, not man for the Sabbath ·To cease·.
MAR 2:28 Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath ·To cease·.”
MAR 3:1 He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
MAR 3:2 They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath ·To cease· day, that they might accuse him.
MAR 3:3 He said to the man who had his hand withered, “Stand up.”
MAR 3:4 He said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath ·To cease· day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?” But they were silent .
MAR 3:5 When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.
MAR 3:6 The Pharisees [Separated] went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
MAR 3:7 Yeshua [Salvation] withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee [District, Circuit], from Judea [Praise],
MAR 3:8 from Jerusalem [City of peace], from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan [Descender], and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
MAR 3:9 He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they would not press on him.
MAR 3:10 For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.
MAR 3:11 The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·!”
MAR 3:12 He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
MAR 3:13 He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.
MAR 3:14 He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
MAR 3:15 and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
MAR 3:16 Simeon [Hearing], to whom he gave the name Peter [Rock];
MAR 3:17 James son of Zebedee [Surplanter son of Yah Has Bestowed]; John [Yah is gracious], the brother of James [Surplanter], and he called them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder;
MAR 3:18 Andrew [Manly]; Philip [Loves horses]; Bartholomew [Son who suspends waters]; Matthew [Gift of Yah]; Thomas [Seeker of truth]; James [Surplanter], the son of Alphaeus [Changing]; Thaddaeus [Child of heart]; Simeon [Hearing] the Zealot [Zealous follower];
MAR 3:19 and Judas Iscariot [Praised Dagger-man], who also betrayed him. He came into a house.
MAR 3:20 The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
MAR 3:21 When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.”
MAR 3:22 The Torah-Teachers who came down from Jerusalem [City of peace] said, “He has Ba'al-Zibbul [Lord of Flies],” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”
MAR 3:23 He summoned them, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan [Adversary] cast out Satan [Adversary]?
MAR 3:24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
MAR 3:25 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
MAR 3:26 If Satan [Adversary] has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end.
MAR 3:27 But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.
MAR 3:28 Most certainly I tell you, all sins ·concrete evil deeds that misses the mark and is without share in the goal· of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;
MAR 3:29 but whoever may blaspheme against Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”
MAR 3:30 Because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”
MAR 3:31 His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.
MAR 3:32 A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you.”
MAR 3:33 He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”
MAR 3:34 Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!
MAR 3:35 For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”
MAR 4:1 Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.
MAR 4:2 He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,
MAR 4:3 “Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,
MAR 4:4 and as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.
MAR 4:5 Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.
MAR 4:6 When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
MAR 4:7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
MAR 4:8 Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”
MAR 4:9 He said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·.”
MAR 4:10 When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
MAR 4:11 He said to them, “To you is given the mystery of God’s Kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,
MAR 4:12 that ‘they may be always looking but never seeing; always listening but never understanding. Otherwise, they might turn and their sins ·concrete evil deeds that misses the mark and is without share in the goal· be forgiven.’”
MAR 4:13 He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?
MAR 4:14 The farmer sows the word.
MAR 4:15 The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan [Adversary] comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.
MAR 4:16 These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.
MAR 4:17 They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they are scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·.
MAR 4:18 Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,
MAR 4:19 and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the epithumia ·lusts· of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
MAR 4:20 Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”
MAR 4:21 He said to them, “Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is not it put on a stand?
MAR 4:22 For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.
MAR 4:23 If any man has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·.”
MAR 4:24 He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.
MAR 4:25 For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”
MAR 4:26 He said, “God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,
MAR 4:27 and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he does not know how.
MAR 4:28 For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
MAR 4:29 But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”
MAR 4:30 He said, “How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?
MAR 4:31 It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,
MAR 4:32 yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”
MAR 4:33 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.
MAR 4:34 Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
MAR 4:35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side.”
MAR 4:36 Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.
MAR 4:37 A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.
MAR 4:38 He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, don’t you care that we are dying?”
MAR 4:39 He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
MAR 4:40 He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no trusting faith?”
MAR 4:41 They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
MAR 5:1 They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
MAR 5:2 When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs.
MAR 5:3 He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,
MAR 5:4 because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.
MAR 5:5 Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
MAR 5:6 When he saw Yeshua [Salvation] from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,
MAR 5:7 and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Yeshua [Salvation], you Son of the Elyon El [Most High God]? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.”
MAR 5:8 For he said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”
MAR 5:9 He asked him, “What is your name?” He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”
MAR 5:10 He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
MAR 5:11 Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.
MAR 5:12 All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”
MAR 5:13 At once Yeshua [Salvation] gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
MAR 5:14 Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had happened.
MAR 5:15 They came to Yeshua [Salvation], and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.
MAR 5:16 Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
MAR 5:17 They began to beg him to depart from their region.
MAR 5:18 As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.
MAR 5:19 He didn’t allow him, but said to him, “Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things MarYah [Master Yahweh] has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.”
MAR 5:20 He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Yeshua [Salvation] had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.
MAR 5:21 When Yeshua [Salvation] had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
MAR 5:22 Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
MAR 5:23 and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”
MAR 5:24 He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
MAR 5:25 A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
MAR 5:26 and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,
MAR 5:27 having heard the things concerning Yeshua [Salvation], came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.
MAR 5:28 For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”
MAR 5:29 Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
MAR 5:30 Immediately Yeshua [Salvation], perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”
MAR 5:31 His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”
MAR 5:32 He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
MAR 5:33 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
MAR 5:34 He said to her, “Daughter, your trusting faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”
MAR 5:35 While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Rabbi ·Teacher· any more?”
MAR 5:36 But Yeshua [Salvation], when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Don’t be afraid, only trust.”
MAR 5:37 He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter [Rock], James [Surplanter], and John [Yah is gracious] the brother of James [Surplanter].
MAR 5:38 He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.
MAR 5:39 When he had entered in, he said to them, “Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”
MAR 5:40 They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
MAR 5:41 Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “Talita kumi! ·Little girl, I tell you, get up·!”
MAR 5:42 Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.
MAR 5:43 He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.
MAR 6:1 He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.
MAR 6:2 When the Sabbath ·To cease· had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things?” and, “What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?
MAR 6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary [Rebellion], and brother of James [Surplanter], Joses, Judah [Praised], and Simeon [Hearing]? Are not his sisters here with us?” They were scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· at him.
MAR 6:4 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”
MAR 6:5 He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them.
MAR 6:6 He marveled because of their unbelief. He went around the villages teaching.
MAR 6:7 He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
MAR 6:8 He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no brass coin money in their purse,
MAR 6:9 but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.
MAR 6:10 He said to them, “Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.
MAR 6:11 Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom [Burning] and Gomorrah [Rebellious people, Tyrants] in the day of judgment than for that city!”
MAR 6:12 They went out and preached that people should teshuvah ·turn repent·.
MAR 6:13 They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them.
MAR 6:14 King Herod [Heroic] heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, “John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.”
MAR 6:15 But others said, “He is Elijah [My God Yah].” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.”
MAR 6:16 But Herod [Heroic], when he heard this, said, “This is John [Yah is gracious], whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.”
MAR 6:17 For Herod [Heroic] himself had sent out and arrested John [Yah is gracious], and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip [Loves horses]’s wife, for he had married her.
MAR 6:18 For John [Yah is gracious] said to Herod [Heroic], “It violates the Torah ·Teaching· for you to marry your brother’s wife.”
MAR 6:19 Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t,
MAR 6:20 for Herod [Heroic] feared John [Yah is gracious], knowing that he was a upright and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.
MAR 6:21 Then a convenient day came, that Herod [Heroic] on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee [District, Circuit].
MAR 6:22 When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod [Heroic] and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”
MAR 6:23 He swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”
MAR 6:24 She went out, and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” She said, “The head of John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser.”
MAR 6:25 She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, “I want you to give me right now the head of John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser on a platter.”
MAR 6:26 The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· her.
MAR 6:27 Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John [Yah is gracious]’s head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
MAR 6:28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.
MAR 6:29 When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
MAR 6:30 The apostles gathered themselves together to Yeshua [Salvation], and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.
MAR 6:31 He said to them, “You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile.” For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
MAR 6:32 They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
MAR 6:33 They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.
MAR 6:34 Yeshua [Salvation] came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.
MAR 6:35 When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.
MAR 6:36 Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”
MAR 6:37 But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii (200 days wages) worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”
MAR 6:38 He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go see.” When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”
MAR 6:39 He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.
MAR 6:40 They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
MAR 6:41 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.
MAR 6:42 They all ate, and were filled.
MAR 6:43 They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.
MAR 6:44 Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
MAR 6:45 Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.
MAR 6:46 After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.
MAR 6:47 When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
MAR 6:48 Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about four o'clock in the morning he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,
MAR 6:49 but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
MAR 6:50 for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, “Take heart! Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)]! Don’t be afraid.”
MAR 6:51 He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;
MAR 6:52 for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
MAR 6:53 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.
MAR 6:54 When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,
MAR 6:55 and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.
MAR 6:56 Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.
MAR 7:1 Then the Pharisees [Separated] and some of the Torah-Teachers gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem [City of peace].
MAR 7:2 Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found this reprovable.
MAR 7:3 (For the Pharisees [Separated] and all the Jews [Praisers], don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.
MAR 7:4 They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)
MAR 7:5 The Pharisees [Separated] and the Torah-Teachers asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”
MAR 7:6 He answered them, “Well did Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
MAR 7:7 But they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’
MAR 7:8 “For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men— the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”
MAR 7:9 He said to them, “Full well do you refuse ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.
MAR 7:10 For Moses [Drawn out] said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’
MAR 7:11 But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God”’;
MAR 7:12 then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,
MAR 7:13 making void ha D'var Elohim ·the Word of God· by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”
MAR 7:14 He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.
MAR 7:15 There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
MAR 7:16 If anyone has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·!”
MAR 7:17 When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.
MAR 7:18 He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,
MAR 7:19 because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”
MAR 7:20 He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.
MAR 7:21 For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, moicheiai ·adulteries·, porhneia ·sexual immorality·, murders, thefts,
MAR 7:22 covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.
MAR 7:23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”
MAR 7:24 From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.
MAR 7:25 For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
MAR 7:26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.
MAR 7:27 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”
MAR 7:28 But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”
MAR 7:29 He said to her, “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”
MAR 7:30 She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.
MAR 7:31 Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee [District, Circuit], through the middle of the region of Decapolis.
MAR 7:32 They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.
MAR 7:33 He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.
MAR 7:34 Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “ Hippatach! ·Be opened·!”
MAR 7:35 Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
MAR 7:36 He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.
MAR 7:37 They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!”
MAR 8:1 In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Yeshua [Salvation] called his disciples to himself, and said to them,
MAR 8:2 “I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.
MAR 8:3 If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.”
MAR 8:4 His disciples answered him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?”
MAR 8:5 He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”
MAR 8:6 He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.
MAR 8:7 They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.
MAR 8:8 They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
MAR 8:9 Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.
MAR 8:10 Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
MAR 8:11 The Pharisees [Separated] came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.
MAR 8:12 He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”
MAR 8:13 He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.
MAR 8:14 They forgot to take bread; and they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.
MAR 8:15 He warned them, saying, “Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees [Separated] and the yeast of Herod [Heroic].”
MAR 8:16 They reasoned with one another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”
MAR 8:17 Yeshua [Salvation], perceiving it, said to them, “Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?
MAR 8:18 Having eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you remember?
MAR 8:19 When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Twelve.”
MAR 8:20 “When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Seven.”
MAR 8:21 He asked them, “Don’t you understand, yet?”
MAR 8:22 He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.
MAR 8:23 He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
MAR 8:24 He looked up, and said, “I see men; for I see them like trees walking.”
MAR 8:25 Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.
MAR 8:26 He sent him away to his house, saying, “Don’t enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village.”
MAR 8:27 Yeshua [Salvation] went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi [Ruler Loves horses]. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do men say that I am?”
MAR 8:28 They told him, “John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser, and others say Elijah [My God Yah], but others: one of the prophets.”
MAR 8:29 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter [Rock] answered, “You are the Messiah [Anointed one].”
MAR 8:30 He commanded them that they should tell no one about him.
MAR 8:31 He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the Torah-Teachers, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
MAR 8:32 He spoke to them openly. Peter [Rock] took him, and began to rebuke him.
MAR 8:33 But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter [Rock], and said, “Get behind me, Satan [Adversary]! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.”
MAR 8:34 He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, “Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his execution-stake, and follow me.
MAR 8:35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.
MAR 8:36 For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
MAR 8:37 For what will a man give in exchange for his life?
MAR 8:38 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and generation of sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in 'Aviv ·his Father·’s glory, with the holy angels.”
MAR 9:1 He said to them, “Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see God’s Kingdom come with power.”
MAR 9:2 After six days Yeshua [Salvation] took with him Peter [Rock], James [Surplanter], and John [Yah is gracious], and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them.
MAR 9:3 His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
MAR 9:4 Elijah [My God Yah] and Moses [Drawn out] appeared to them, and they were talking with Yeshua [Salvation].
MAR 9:5 Peter [Rock] answered Yeshua [Salvation], “Rabbi ·Teacher·, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses [Drawn out], and one for Elijah [My God Yah].”
MAR 9:6 For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.
MAR 9:7 A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· Son. Listen to him.”
MAR 9:8 Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Yeshua [Salvation] only.
MAR 9:9 As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
MAR 9:10 They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.
MAR 9:11 They asked him, saying, “Why do the Torah-Teachers say that Elijah [My God Yah] must come first?”
MAR 9:12 He said to them, “Elijah [My God Yah] indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?
MAR 9:13 But I tell you that Elijah [My God Yah] has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.”
MAR 9:14 Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and Torah-Teachers questioning them.
MAR 9:15 Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him.
MAR 9:16 He asked the Torah-Teachers, “What are you asking them?”
MAR 9:17 One of the multitude answered, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;
MAR 9:18 and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.”
MAR 9:19 He answered him, “Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.”
MAR 9:20 They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.
MAR 9:21 He asked 'Aviv [his father], “How long has it been since this has come to him?” He said, “From childhood.
MAR 9:22 Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.”
MAR 9:23 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “If you can trust, all things are possible to him who trusts.”
MAR 9:24 Immediately the Abba father of the child cried out with tears, “I trust. Help my unbelief!”
MAR 9:25 When Yeshua [Salvation] saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, “You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!”
MAR 9:26 Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, “He is dead.”
MAR 9:27 But Yeshua [Salvation] took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
MAR 9:28 When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”
MAR 9:29 He said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.”
MAR 9:30 They went out from there, and passed through Galilee [District, Circuit]. He didn’t want anyone to know it.
MAR 9:31 For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, “The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.”
MAR 9:32 But they didn’t understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
MAR 9:33 He came to Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], and when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?”
MAR 9:34 But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest.
MAR 9:35 He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, “If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.”
MAR 9:36 He took a little child, and set him in the middle of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
MAR 9:37 “Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.”
MAR 9:38 John [Yah is gracious] said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.”
MAR 9:39 But Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Don’t forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
MAR 9:40 For whoever is not against us is on our side.
MAR 9:41 For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Messiah [Anointed one]’s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.
MAR 9:42 Whoever will cause one of these little ones who trust in me to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.
MAR 9:43 If your hand causes you to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead), into the unquenchable fire,
MAR 9:44 ‘where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.’
MAR 9:45 If your foot causes you to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead), into the fire that will never be quenched—
MAR 9:46 ‘where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.’
MAR 9:47 If your eye causes you to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into God’s Kingdom with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead) of fire,
MAR 9:48 ‘where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.’
MAR 9:49 For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.
MAR 9:50 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”
MAR 10:1 He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea [Praise] and beyond the Jordan [Descender]. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.
MAR 10:2 Pharisees [Separated] came to him testing him, and asked him, “Does the Torah ·Teaching· permit a man to divorce his wife?”
MAR 10:3 He answered, “What did Moses [Drawn out] enjoin unto you?”
MAR 10:4 They said, “Moses [Drawn out] allowed a certificate of divorce to be written , and to divorce her.”
MAR 10:5 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment.
MAR 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.
MAR 10:7 For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,
MAR 10:8 and the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.
MAR 10:9 What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”
MAR 10:10 In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter.
MAR 10:11 He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits moichao ·act of adultery· against her.
MAR 10:12 If a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits moichao ·act of adultery·.”
MAR 10:13 They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.
MAR 10:14 But when Yeshua [Salvation] saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, “Allow the little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these.
MAR 10:15 Most certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”
MAR 10:16 He took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.
MAR 10:17 As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Rabbi ·Teacher·, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”
MAR 10:18 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except one— God’s Torah ·Teaching·.
MAR 10:19 You know the mitzvot ·instructions·: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not moicheuo ·commit adultery·,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”
MAR 10:20 He said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, I have observed all these things from my youth.”
MAR 10:21 Looking at him, Yeshua [Salvation] felt agapao ·total devoted love· towards him, and said to him, “One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the execution-stake.”
MAR 10:22 But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.
MAR 10:23 Yeshua [Salvation] looked around, and said to his disciples, “How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!”
MAR 10:24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Yeshua [Salvation] answered again, “Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!
MAR 10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye (small door of city gate), than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”
MAR 10:26 They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”
MAR 10:27 Yeshua [Salvation], looking at them, said, “With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”
MAR 10:28 Peter [Rock] began to tell him, “Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.”
MAR 10:29 Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,
MAR 10:30 but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.
MAR 10:31 But many who are first will be last; and the last first.”
MAR 10:32 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem [City of peace]; and Yeshua [Salvation] was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him.
MAR 10:33 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem [City of peace]. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the Torah-Teachers. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles.
MAR 10:34 They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”
MAR 10:35 James [Surplanter] and John [Yah is gracious], the sons of Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah], came near to him, saying, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask.”
MAR 10:36 He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
MAR 10:37 They said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory.”
MAR 10:38 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with?”
MAR 10:39 They said to him, “We are able.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with;
MAR 10:40 but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.”
MAR 10:41 When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards James [Surplanter] and John [Yah is gracious].
MAR 10:42 Yeshua [Salvation] summoned them, and said to them, “You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
MAR 10:43 But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.
MAR 10:44 Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bond-servant of all.
MAR 10:45 For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
MAR 10:46 They came to Jericho [Fragrant, Moon]. As he went out from Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.
MAR 10:47 When he heard that it was Yeshua [Salvation] the Nazarene [person from Branch, Separated one], he began to cry out, and say, “Yeshua [Salvation], you son of David [Beloved], have mercy on me!”
MAR 10:48 Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David [Beloved], have mercy on me!”
MAR 10:49 Yeshua [Salvation] stood still, and said, “Call him.” They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!”
MAR 10:50 He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Yeshua [Salvation].
MAR 10:51 Yeshua [Salvation] asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “ Rabboni ·My teacher!· I want to see again.”
MAR 10:52 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Go your way. Your trusting faith has made you well.” Immediately he received his sight, and followed Yeshua [Salvation] on the way.
MAR 11:1 When they came near to Jerusalem [City of peace], to Bethsphage and Bethany [House of affliction], at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
MAR 11:2 and said to them, “Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him.
MAR 11:3 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs him;’ and immediately he will send him back here.”
MAR 11:4 They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him.
MAR 11:5 Some of those who stood there asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young donkey?”
MAR 11:6 They said to them just as Yeshua [Salvation] had enjoined unto them, and they let them go.
MAR 11:7 They brought the young donkey to Yeshua [Salvation], and threw their garments on it, and Yeshua [Salvation] sat on it.
MAR 11:8 Many people carpeted the road with their garments, while others spread out green branches which they had cut in the fields.
MAR 11:9 Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, “ Hosanna! ·Save now!· Blessed is he who comes in the name of MarYah [Master Yahweh]!
MAR 11:10 Blessed is the kingdom of Avinu ·our Father· David [Beloved] that is coming in the name of Adonai ! Hosanna ·Save now· in the highest!”
MAR 11:11 Yeshua [Salvation] entered into the temple in Jerusalem [City of peace]. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany [House of affliction] with the twelve.
MAR 11:12 The next day, when they had come out from Bethany [House of affliction], he was hungry.
MAR 11:13 Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
MAR 11:14 Yeshua [Salvation] told it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” and his disciples heard it.
MAR 11:15 They came to Jerusalem [City of peace], and Yeshua [Salvation] entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves.
MAR 11:16 He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple.
MAR 11:17 He taught, saying to them, “Is not it written in the Tanakh ·Torah Prophets Writings·, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?’ But you have made it a den of robbers!”
MAR 11:18 The chief priests and the Torah-Teachers heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
MAR 11:19 When evening came, he went out of the city.
MAR 11:20 As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.
MAR 11:21 Peter [Rock], remembering, said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.”
MAR 11:22 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Have trusting faith in God.
MAR 11:23 For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but trusts that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says.
MAR 11:24 Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, trust that you have received them, and you shall have them.
MAR 11:25 Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that 'Avikah ·your Father·, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your lapse and deviation from truth.
MAR 11:26 But if you do not forgive, neither will 'Avikah shebashamayim ·your Father in Heaven· forgive your lapse and deviation from truth.”
MAR 11:27 They came again to Jerusalem [City of peace], and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the Torah-Teachers, and the elders came to him,
MAR 11:28 and they began saying to him, “By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?”
MAR 11:29 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAR 11:30 The mikvah ·ritual washing baptism· of John [Yah is gracious]— was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.”
MAR 11:31 They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘From heaven;’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not trust him?’
MAR 11:32 If we should say, ‘From men’”— they feared the people, for all held John [Yah is gracious] to really be a prophet.
MAR 11:33 They answered Yeshua [Salvation], “We don’t know.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
MAR 12:1 He began to speak to them in parables. “A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.
MAR 12:2 When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.
MAR 12:3 They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.
MAR 12:4 Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
MAR 12:5 Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.
MAR 12:6 Therefore still having one, his agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
MAR 12:7 But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
MAR 12:8 They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
MAR 12:9 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.
MAR 12:10 Haven’t you even read this Scripture: ‘The stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief corner-stone.
MAR 12:11 This was from MarYah [Master Yahweh], it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
MAR 12:12 They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away.
MAR 12:13 They sent some of the Pharisees [Separated] and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.
MAR 12:14 When they had come, they asked him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you are not partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Does Torah ·Teaching· say to pay taxes to Caesar [Ruler], or not?
MAR 12:15 Shall we give, or shall we not give?” But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius [one day’s wage], that I may see it.”
MAR 12:16 They brought it. He said to them, “Whose is this image and inscription?” They said to him, “Caesar’s [Ruler]’s.”
MAR 12:17 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Render to Caesar [Ruler] the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” They marveled greatly at him.
MAR 12:18 There came to him Sadducees [Morally-upright], who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,
MAR 12:19 “Rabbi ·Teacher·, Moses [Drawn out] wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’
MAR 12:20 There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.
MAR 12:21 The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;
MAR 12:22 and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.
MAR 12:23 In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”
MAR 12:24 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Is not this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?
MAR 12:25 For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
MAR 12:26 But about the dead, that they are raised; haven’t you read in the book of Moses [Drawn out], about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], the God of Isaac [Laughter], and the God of Jacob [Supplanter]’?
MAR 12:27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”
MAR 12:28 One of the Torah-Teachers came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which mitzvah ·instruction· is the most important of them all?”
MAR 12:29 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “The greatest is, ‘Hear, Israel [God prevails], MarYah [Master Yahweh] our God, MarYah [Master Yahweh] is echad ·one unity·:
MAR 12:30 you shall have agapao ·total devotion love· to MarYah [Master Yahweh] your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment.
MAR 12:31 The second is like this, ‘You shall show agapao ·total devoted love· to your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other mitzvah ·instruction· greater than these.”
MAR 12:32 The scribe said to him, “Truly, Rabbi ·Teacher·, you have said well that he is echad ·one unity·, and there is none other besides him,
MAR 12:33 and to have agapao ·totally devoted love· to him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to show agapao ·totally devoted love· to his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
MAR 12:34 When Yeshua [Salvation] saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from God’s Kingdom.” No one dared ask him any question after that.
MAR 12:35 Yeshua [Salvation] responded, as he taught in the temple, “How is it that the Torah-Teachers say that the Messiah [Anointed one] is the son of David [Beloved]?
MAR 12:36 For David [Beloved] himself said in Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness], ‘Yahweh said to 'adoni ·my Lord·, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.”’
MAR 12:37 Therefore David [Beloved] himself calls him 'adoni ·my Lord·, in what way can he be his son?” The common people heard him gladly.
MAR 12:38 In his teaching he said to them, “Beware of the Torah-Teachers, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,
MAR 12:39 and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:
MAR 12:40 those who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”
MAR 12:41 Yeshua [Salvation] sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast brass coins into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.
MAR 12:42 A poor widow came, and she cast in two small bronze coins, which equal a quadrans coin (Roman quarter coin about 3/8 of a cent).
MAR 12:43 He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, “Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,
MAR 12:44 for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”
MAR 13:1 As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!”
MAR 13:2 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.”
MAR 13:3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter [Rock], James [Surplanter], John [Yah is gracious], and Andrew [Manly] asked him privately,
MAR 13:4 “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?”
MAR 13:5 Yeshua [Salvation], answering, began to tell them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.
MAR 13:6 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], I am he!’ and will lead many astray.
MAR 13:7 “When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.
MAR 13:8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.
MAR 13:9 But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
MAR 13:10 The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.
MAR 13:11 When they lead you away and deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness].
MAR 13:12 “Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
MAR 13:13 You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
MAR 13:14 But when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel [My judge is God] the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea [Praise] flee to the mountains,
MAR 13:15 and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.
MAR 13:16 Let him who is in the field not teshuvah ·completely return· back to take his cloak.
MAR 13:17 But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!
MAR 13:18 Pray that your flight won’t be in the winter.
MAR 13:19 For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.
MAR 13:20 Unless MarYah [Master Yahweh] had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.
MAR 13:21 Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah [Anointed one]!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ don’t trust it.
MAR 13:22 For there will arise false Messiahs [Anointed ones] and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
MAR 13:23 But you watch. “Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
MAR 13:24 But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,
MAR 13:25 the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
MAR 13:26 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
MAR 13:27 Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.
MAR 13:28 “Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and produces its leaves, you know that the summer is near;
MAR 13:29 even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.
MAR 13:30 Most certainly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.
MAR 13:31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
MAR 13:32 But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Abba Father.
MAR 13:33 Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don’t know when the time is.
MAR 13:34 “It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also enjoined the doorkeeper to keep watch.
MAR 13:35 Watch therefore, for you don’t know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;
MAR 13:36 lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.
MAR 13:37 What I tell you, I tell all: Watch.”
MAR 14:1 It was now two days before the festival of the Pesac ·Passover· (Nissan 12), also called the festival of Matzah ·Unleavened bread·, and the chief priests and the Torah-Teachers sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.
MAR 14:2 For they said, “Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people.”
MAR 14:3 While he was at Bethany [House of affliction], in the house of Simeon [Hearing] the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard— very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.
MAR 14:4 But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?
MAR 14:5 For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii (300 days wages), and given to the poor.” They grumbled against her.
MAR 14:6 But Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.
MAR 14:7 For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.
MAR 14:8 She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.
MAR 14:9 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”
MAR 14:10 Judas Iscariot [Praised Dagger-man], who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.
MAR 14:11 They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.
MAR 14:12 On the first day of Matzah ·Unleavened bread· (Nissan 14), when they sacrificed the Pesac ·Passover· lamb, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare your Seder ·Order / Passover meal·?”
MAR 14:13 He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, “Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,
MAR 14:14 and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, ‘The Rabbi ·Teacher· says, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Pesac ·Passover· with my disciples?”’
MAR 14:15 He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”
MAR 14:16 His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Seder · Order / Passover meal·.
MAR 14:17 When it was evening he came with the twelve.
MAR 14:18 As they sat and were eating, Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me— he who eats with me.”
MAR 14:19 They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not I?”
MAR 14:20 He answered them, “It is one of the twelve, he who dips matzah ·unleavened bread· with me in the dish (of bitter herbs).
MAR 14:21 For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”
MAR 14:22 As they were eating, Yeshua [Salvation] took matzah ·unleavened bread·, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, “Take, eat. This is my body.”
MAR 14:23 He took the (third) cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.
MAR 14:24 He said to them, “This is my blood of the new covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·, which is poured out for many.
MAR 14:25 Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in God’s Kingdom.”
MAR 14:26 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAR 14:27 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “All of you will be made to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
MAR 14:28 However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee [District, Circuit].”
MAR 14:29 But Peter [Rock] said to him, “Although all will feel scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·, yet I will not.”
MAR 14:30 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”
MAR 14:31 But he spoke all the more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same thing.
MAR 14:32 They came to a place which was named Gethsemane [Olive oil press]. He said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I pray.”
MAR 14:33 He took with him Peter [Rock], James [Surplanter], and John [Yah is gracious], and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.
MAR 14:34 He said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.”
MAR 14:35 He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.
MAR 14:36 He said, “ Abba, Dear Dad, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.”
MAR 14:37 He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter [Rock], “Simeon [Hearing], are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour?
MAR 14:38 Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
MAR 14:39 Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
MAR 14:40 Again he teshuvah ·completely returned·, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what to answer him.
MAR 14:41 He came the third time, and said to them, “Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·.
MAR 14:42 Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”
MAR 14:43 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas [Praised], one of the twelve, came— and with him a multitude with machairon ·machetes, small sword knives· and clubs, from the chief priests, the Torah-Teachers, and the elders.
MAR 14:44 Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will phileo ·affectionate love, kiss·, he is the one. Seize him, and lead him away safely.”
MAR 14:45 When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, “Rabbi, Rabbi! ·Teacher, Teacher·!” and kissed him.
MAR 14:46 They laid their hands on him, and seized him.
MAR 14:47 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his machaira ·machete, small sword knife·, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
MAR 14:48 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Have you come out, as against a robber, with machairon ·machetes, small sword knives· and clubs to seize me?
MAR 14:49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”
MAR 14:50 They all left him, and fled.
MAR 14:51 A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,
MAR 14:52 but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
MAR 14:53 They led Yeshua [Salvation] away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the Torah-Teachers came together with him.
MAR 14:54 Peter [Rock] had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.
MAR 14:55 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Yeshua [Salvation] to put him to death, and found none.
MAR 14:56 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other.
MAR 14:57 Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,
MAR 14:58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’”
MAR 14:59 Even so, their testimony did not agree.
MAR 14:60 The high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Yeshua [Salvation], “Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?”
MAR 14:61 But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah [Anointed one], the Son of the Blessed?”
MAR 14:62 Yeshua [Salvation] said, “ Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)]. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”
MAR 14:63 The high priest tore his clothes, and said, “What further need have we of witnesses?
MAR 14:64 You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
MAR 14:65 Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.
MAR 14:66 As Peter [Rock] was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,
MAR 14:67 and seeing Peter [Rock] warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene [person from Branch, Separated one], Yeshua [Salvation]!”
MAR 14:68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
MAR 14:69 The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.”
MAR 14:70 But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter [Rock], “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.”
MAR 14:71 But he began to curse, and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!”
MAR 14:72 The rooster crowed the second time. Peter [Rock] remembered the word, how that Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought about that, he wept.
MAR 15:1 Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and Torah-Teachers, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Yeshua [Salvation], and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate [Armed with javelin].
MAR 15:2 Pilate [Armed with javelin] asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews [Praisers]?” He answered, “So you say.”
MAR 15:3 The chief priests accused him of many things.
MAR 15:4 Pilate [Armed with javelin] again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”
MAR 15:5 But Yeshua [Salvation] made no further answer, so that Pilate [Armed with javelin] marveled.
MAR 15:6 Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
MAR 15:7 There was one called Bar-Abba [Son Father], bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
MAR 15:8 The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
MAR 15:9 Pilate [Armed with javelin] answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews [Praisers]?”
MAR 15:10 For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
MAR 15:11 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Bar-Abba [Son Father] to them instead.
MAR 15:12 Pilate [Armed with javelin] again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews [Praisers]?”
MAR 15:13 They cried out again, “Crucify him!”
MAR 15:14 Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”
MAR 15:15 Pilate [Armed with javelin], wishing to please the multitude, released Bar-Abba [Son Father] to them, and handed over Yeshua [Salvation], when he had flogged him, to be nailed to the execution-stake.
MAR 15:16 The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.
MAR 15:17 They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
MAR 15:18 They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews [Praisers]!”
MAR 15:19 They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.
MAR 15:20 When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.
MAR 15:21 They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simeon [Hearing] of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his execution-stake.
MAR 15:22 They brought him to the place called Golgotha , which means, “[The place of a skull].”
MAR 15:23 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.
MAR 15:24 Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.
MAR 15:25 It was nine in the morning when they nailed him to the stake.
MAR 15:26 The superscription of his accusation was written over him, “The King of the Jews [Praisers] .”
MAR 15:27 With him they executed on the stake two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
MAR 15:28 The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was counted with lawless ·not subject to Torah, departing from Torah·. people”
MAR 15:29 Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
MAR 15:30 save yourself, and come down from the execution-stake!”
MAR 15:31 Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the Torah-Teachers said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.
MAR 15:32 Let the Messiah [Anointed one], the Melek Isra'el [King of God prevails], now come down from the execution-stake, that we may see and trust him.” Those who were placed on execution-stakes with him also insulted him.
MAR 15:33 At noon, there was darkness over the whole land until three o'clock in the afternoon.
MAR 15:34 At three, Yeshua [Salvation] cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
MAR 15:35 Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah [My God Yah].”
MAR 15:36 One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah [My God Yah] comes to take him down.”
MAR 15:37 Yeshua [Salvation] cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
MAR 15:38 The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.
MAR 15:39 When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·!”
MAR 15:40 There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower], and Mary [Rebellion] the mother of James [Surplanter] the less and of Joses, and Salome;
MAR 15:41 who, when he was in Galilee [District, Circuit], followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem [City of peace].
MAR 15:42 When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day (Nissan 14), that is, the day before the festival Sabbath ·To cease·,
MAR 15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea [May he add of Lofty place], a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate [Armed with javelin], and asked for Yeshua's [Salvation]'s body.
MAR 15:44 Pilate [Armed with javelin] marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.
MAR 15:45 When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph [May he add].
MAR 15:46 He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
MAR 15:47 Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower] and Mary [Rebellion], the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
MAR 16:1 When the Sabbath ·To cease· was past (after dark on Nissan 17, the day of First Fruits #1), Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower], and Mary [Rebellion] the mother of James [Surplanter], and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
MAR 16:2 Very early morning, when the sun had started to rise, on the first day of the week, (the day of First Fruits #1), they came to the tomb.
MAR 16:3 They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?”
MAR 16:4 for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
MAR 16:5 Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.
MAR 16:6 He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Yeshua [Salvation], the Nazarene [person from Branch, Separated one], who was executed on the stake. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!
MAR 16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter [Rock], ‘He goes before you into Galilee [District, Circuit]. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”
MAR 16:8 They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.
MAR 16:9 Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, (the day of First Fruits #1), he appeared first to Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower], from whom he had cast out seven demons.
MAR 16:10 She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
MAR 16:11 When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they distrusted.
MAR 16:12 After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.
MAR 16:13 They went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t trust them, either.
MAR 16:14 Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t trust those who had seen him after he had risen.
MAR 16:15 He said to them, “Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.
MAR 16:16 He who trusts and is immersed will be saved; but he who distrusts will be condemned.
MAR 16:17 These signs will accompany those who trust: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;
MAR 16:18 they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”
MAR 16:19 So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
MAR 16:20 They went out, and preached everywhere, the Master working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen ·So be it·.
LUK 1:1 Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
LUK 1:2 even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,
LUK 1:3 it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus [God friend];
LUK 1:4 that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
LUK 1:5 There was in the days of Herod [Heroic], the king of Judea [Praise], a certain priest named Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], of the priestly division of Abiyah [My father Yah]. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron [Light-bringer], and her name was Elizabeth [My God oath].
LUK 1:6 They were both upright before God, observing all the mitzvot ·instructions· and ordinances of Yahweh blamelessly.
LUK 1:7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth [My God oath] was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.
LUK 1:8 Now while he served in the priest’s office before God in the order of his priestly division,
LUK 1:9 according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of Yahweh and burn incense (as the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· on Yom Kippur ·Day of Atonement·). On the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· on the 10th day).
LUK 1:10 All the people were outside, praying, at the time of the incense burning,
LUK 1:11 when there appeared to him an angel of MarYah [Master Yahweh], standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
LUK 1:12 Zacharias [Remembered by Yah] was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
LUK 1:13 But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth [My God oath], will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John [Yah is gracious].
LUK 1:14 You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.
LUK 1:15 For he will be great in the sight of MarYah [Master Yahweh], and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness], even from his mother’s womb.
LUK 1:16 He will turn many of the children of to MarYah [Master Yahweh], their God.
LUK 1:17 He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah [My God Yah], ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for Adonai .”
LUK 1:18 Zacharias [Remembered by Yah] said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”
LUK 1:19 The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel [Man of God], who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.
LUK 1:20 Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t trust my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”
LUK 1:21 The people were waiting for Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.
LUK 1:22 When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
LUK 1:23 When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
LUK 1:24 After these days Elizabeth [My God oath], his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,
LUK 1:25 “Thus has MarYah [Master Yahweh] done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.”
LUK 1:26 Now in the sixth month Elul ·Search, 6·, the angel Gabriel [Man of God] was sent from God to a city of Galilee [District, Circuit], named Nazareth [Branch, Separated one],
LUK 1:27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph [May he add], of David [Beloved]’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary [Rebellion].
LUK 1:28 Having come in, the angel said to her, “Shalom ·Complete peace·, favored lady! Adonai is with you. Blessed are you among women!”
LUK 1:29 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
LUK 1:30 The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary [Rebellion], for you have found favor with God.
LUK 1:31 Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and give birth to a son, and will call his name ‘Yeshua [Salvation].’
LUK 1:32 He will be great, and will be called haBen haElohim Chayim [the Son of the God Living]. MarYah [Master Yahweh] God will give him the throne of his forefather, David [Beloved],
LUK 1:33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob [Supplanter] forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”
LUK 1:34 Mary [Rebellion] said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”
LUK 1:35 The angel answered her, “The Ruach Kodesh [Holy Spirit, Breath] will come on you, and the power of the Elyon [Most High] will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.
LUK 1:36 Behold, Elizabeth [My God oath], your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month Elul ·Search, 6· with her who was called barren.
LUK 1:37 For nothing spoken by God is impossible.”
LUK 1:38 Mary [Rebellion] said, “Behold, the servant of MarYah [Master Yahweh]; let it be done to me according to your word.” The angel departed from her.
LUK 1:39 Mary [Rebellion] arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah [Praised],
LUK 1:40 and entered into the house of Zacharias [Remembered by Yah] and greeted Elizabeth [My God oath].
LUK 1:41 When Elizabeth [My God oath] heard Mary [Rebellion]’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth [My God oath] was filled with Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness].
LUK 1:42 She called out with a loud voice, and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
LUK 1:43 Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
LUK 1:44 For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
LUK 1:45 Blessed is she who trusted, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from MarYah [Master Yahweh]!”
LUK 1:46 Mary [Rebellion] said, “My soul magnifies Adonai .
LUK 1:47 My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
LUK 1:48 for he has looked at the humble state of his servant. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
LUK 1:49 For he who is mighty has done great things for me. Holy set-apart is his name.
LUK 1:50 And in every generation, he has eleos ·merciful compassion in action· on those who fear him.
LUK 1:51 He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
LUK 1:52 He has put down princes from their thrones. And has exalted the lowly.
LUK 1:53 He has filled the hungry with good things. He has sent the rich away empty.
LUK 1:54 He has given help to Israel [God prevails], his servant, that he might remember eleos ·merciful compassion in action·,
LUK 1:55 As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham [Father of a multitude] and his offspring forever.”
LUK 1:56 Mary [Rebellion] stayed with her about three months, and then teshuvah ·completely returned· to her house.
LUK 1:57 Now the time that Elizabeth [My God oath] should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son.
LUK 1:58 Her neighbors and her relatives heard that Adonai had magnified his eleos ·merciful compassion in action· towards her, and they rejoiced with her.
LUK 1:59 On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], after the name of his father.
LUK 1:60 His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John [Yah is gracious].”
LUK 1:61 They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”
LUK 1:62 They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
LUK 1:63 He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John [Yah is gracious].” They all marveled.
LUK 1:64 His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.
LUK 1:65 Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea [Praise].
LUK 1:66 All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of MarYah [Master Yahweh] was with him.
LUK 1:67 His father, Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], was filled with Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness], and prophesied, saying,
LUK 1:68 “Blessed be MarYah [Master Yahweh], the God of Israel [God prevails], for he has visited and redeemed his people;
LUK 1:69 and has raised up a horn of yishu'ah ·salvation· for us in the house of his servant David [Beloved]
LUK 1:70 (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),
LUK 1:71 yishu'ah ·salvation· from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
LUK 1:72 to show eleos ·merciful compassion in action· towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·,
LUK 1:73 the covenant oath which he swore to Abraham [Father of a multitude], Avinu ·our Father·,
LUK 1:74 to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear,
LUK 1:75 In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
LUK 1:76 And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Elyon [Most High], for you will go before the face of Yahweh to prepare his ways,
LUK 1:77 to give knowledge of yishu'ah ·salvation· to his people by the remission of their abstract sins ·miss the marks·,
LUK 1:78 because of the tender eleos ·merciful compassion in action· of our God, whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
LUK 1:79 to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
LUK 1:80 The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel [God prevails].
LUK 2:1 Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar [Ruler] Augustus [Revered, Esteemed, Venerable] that all the world should be enrolled.
LUK 2:2 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria [Elevated].
LUK 2:3 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city.
LUK 2:4 Joseph [May he add] also went up from Galilee [District, Circuit], out of the city of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one], into Judea [Praise], to David [Beloved]’s city, which is called Bethlehem [House of Bread], because he was of the house and family of David [Beloved];
LUK 2:5 to enroll himself with Mary [Rebellion], who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
LUK 2:6 While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth.
LUK 2:7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
LUK 2:8 There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
LUK 2:9 Behold, an angel of Adonai stood by them, and the shekhinah ·manifest weighty glory and presence of God· shone around them, and they were terrified.
LUK 2:10 The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
LUK 2:11 For there is born to you today, in David [Beloved]’s city, a Savior, who is Messiah [Anointed one] the MarYah [Master Yahweh].
LUK 2:12 This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”
LUK 2:13 Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
LUK 2:14 “Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men.”
LUK 2:15 When the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem [House of Bread], now, and see this thing that has happened, which MarYah [Master Yahweh] has made known to us.”
LUK 2:16 They came with haste, and found both Mary [Rebellion] and Joseph [May he add], and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
LUK 2:17 When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
LUK 2:18 All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
LUK 2:19 But Mary [Rebellion] kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
LUK 2:20 The shepherds teshuvah ·completely returned·, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.
LUK 2:21 When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Yeshua [Salvation], which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
LUK 2:22 When the time came for their purification according to the Torah ·Teaching· of Moses [Drawn out] were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem [City of peace], to present him to MarYah [Master Yahweh]
LUK 2:23 (as it is written in the Torah ·Teaching· of MarYah [Master Yahweh], “Every firstborn male shall be consecrated holy to MarYah [Master Yahweh]”),
LUK 2:24 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Torah ·Teaching· of MarYah [Master Yahweh], “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”
LUK 2:25 Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem [City of peace] whose name was Simeon [Hearing]. This man was upright and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel [God prevails], and Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] was on him.
LUK 2:26 It had been revealed to him by Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] that he should not see death before he had seen Adonai’s Messiah [Anointed one].
LUK 2:27 Prompted by haRuach [the Spirit, Breath], he went into the temple courts; and when the parents brought in the child Yeshua [Salvation] to do for him what the Torah ·Teaching· required,
LUK 2:28 then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
LUK 2:29 “Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in peace;
LUK 2:30 for my eyes have seen your method of salvation,
LUK 2:31 which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
LUK 2:32 a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel [God prevails].”
LUK 2:33 Joseph [May he add] and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,
LUK 2:34 and Simeon [Hearing] blessed them, and said to Mary [Rebellion], his mother, “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel [God prevails], and for a sign which is spoken against.
LUK 2:35 Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”
LUK 2:36 There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher [Happy] (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
LUK 2:37 and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day.
LUK 2:38 Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to Yahweh, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem [City of peace].
LUK 2:39 When they had accomplished everything required by the Torah ·Teaching· of MarYah [Master Yahweh], they returned into Galilee [District, Circuit], to their town of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one].
LUK 2:40 The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
LUK 2:41 His parents went every year to Jerusalem [City of peace] at the festival of the Pesac ·Passover·.
LUK 2:42 When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem [City of peace] according to the custom of the feast,
LUK 2:43 and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were making teshuvah ·complete return·, the boy Yeshua [Salvation] stayed behind in Jerusalem [City of peace]. Joseph [May he add] and his mother didn’t know it,
LUK 2:44 but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
LUK 2:45 When they didn’t find him, they make teshuvah ·complete return· to Jerusalem [City of peace], looking for him.
LUK 2:46 After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.
LUK 2:47 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
LUK 2:48 When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your 'Avikah ·your Father· and I were anxiously looking for you.”
LUK 2:49 He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in 'Avi ·my Father·’s house?”
LUK 2:50 They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them.
LUK 2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth [Branch, Separated one]. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
LUK 2:52 And Yeshua [Salvation] increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
LUK 3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar [Ruler], Pontius Pilate [Armed with javelin] being governor of Judea [Praise], and Herod [Heroic] being tetrarch (one of four co-emperors) of Galilee [District, Circuit], and his brother Philip [Loves horses] tetrarch (one of four co-emperors) of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch (one of four co-emperors) of Abilene,
LUK 3:2 in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out], ha D'var Elohim ·the Word of God· came to John [Yah is gracious], the son of Zacharias [Remembered by Yah], in the wilderness.
LUK 3:3 He came into all the region around the Jordan [Descender], preaching the mikvah ·ritual washing baptism· of teshuvah ·complete repentance· for remission of abstract sins ·miss the marks·.
LUK 3:4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of MarYah [Master Yahweh]. Make his paths straight.
LUK 3:5 Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.
LUK 3:6 Then all humanity will see God’s method of deliverance.’”
LUK 3:7 He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be immersed by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
LUK 3:8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of teshuvah ·complete repentance·, and don’t begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham [Father of a multitude] Avinu ·our Father·;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham [Father of a multitude] from these stones!
LUK 3:9 Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.”
LUK 3:10 The multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?”
LUK 3:11 He answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.”
LUK 3:12 Tax collectors also came to be immersed, and they said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, what must we do?”
LUK 3:13 He said to them, “Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.”
LUK 3:14 Soldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?” He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.”
LUK 3:15 As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John [Yah is gracious], whether perhaps he was the Messiah [Anointed one],
LUK 3:16 John [Yah is gracious] answered them all, “I indeed mikvah ·baptise· you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will mikvah ·baptise· you in Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] and fire,
LUK 3:17 whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
LUK 3:18 Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,
LUK 3:19 but Herod [Heroic] the tetrarch (one of four co-emperors), being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod [Heroic] had done,
LUK 3:20 added this also to them all, that he shut up John [Yah is gracious] in prison.
LUK 3:21 Now when all the people were immersed, Yeshua [Salvation] also had been immersed, and was praying. The sky was opened,
LUK 3:22 and Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· Son. In you I am well pleased.”
LUK 3:23 Yeshua [Salvation] himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph [May he add], the son of Heli,
LUK 3:24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi [United with], the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph [May he add],
LUK 3:25 the son of Mattathias [Gift of Yah], the son of Amos [Burden bearor], the son of Nahum [Comforter], the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
LUK 3:26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias [Gift of Yah], the son of Semein, the son of Joseph [May he add], the son of Judah [Praised],
LUK 3:27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
LUK 3:28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,
LUK 3:29 the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi [United with],
LUK 3:30 the son of Simeon [Hearing], the son of Judah [Praised], the son of Joseph [May he add], the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,
LUK 3:31 the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David [Beloved],
LUK 3:32 the son of Jesse [My husband], the son of Obed, the son of Boaz [In majesty, in strength], the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
LUK 3:33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram [Elevated], the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah [Praised],
LUK 3:34 the son of Jacob [Supplanter], the son of Isaac [Laughter], the son of Abraham [Father of a multitude], the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
LUK 3:35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
LUK 3:36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem [Name], the son of Noah [Rest], the son of Lamech,
LUK 3:37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,
LUK 3:38 the son of Enos, the son of Seth [Appointed], the son of Adam [Human, Red earth], the son of God.
LUK 4:1 Yeshua [Salvation], full of Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness], teshuvah ·completely returned· from the Jordan [Descender], and was led by haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] into the wilderness
LUK 4:2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil [Accuser]. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.
LUK 4:3 The devil [Accuser] said to him, “If you are the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·, command this stone to become bread.”
LUK 4:4 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, saying, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every d'var Elohim ·word of God·.’”
LUK 4:5 The devil [Accuser], leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
LUK 4:6 The devil [Accuser] said to him, “I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.
LUK 4:7 If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.”
LUK 4:8 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Get behind me Satan [Adversary]! For it is written, ‘You shall worship MarYah [Master Yahweh] your God, and you shall serve him only.’”
LUK 4:9 He led him to Jerusalem [City of peace], and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·, cast yourself down from here,
LUK 4:10 for it is written, ‘He will enjoin his angels concerning you, to guard you;’
LUK 4:11 and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”
LUK 4:12 Yeshua [Salvation] answering, said to him, “It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt Yahweh your God.’”
LUK 4:13 When the devil [Accuser] had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.
LUK 4:14 Yeshua [Salvation] teshuvah ·completely returned· in the power of haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] into Galilee [District, Circuit], and news about him spread through all the surrounding area.
LUK 4:15 He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
LUK 4:16 He came to Nazareth [Branch, Separated one], where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath ·To cease· day, and stood up to read.
LUK 4:17 The book of the prophet Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
LUK 4:18 “The Ruach of MarYah [Spirit, Breath of Master Yahweh] is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,
LUK 4:19 and to proclaim the acceptable year of MarYah [Master Yahweh].”
LUK 4:20 He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.
LUK 4:21 He began to tell them, “Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”
LUK 4:22 All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, “Is not this Joseph [May he add]’s son?”
LUK 4:23 He said to them, “Doubtless you will tell me this parable, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], do also here in your hometown.’”
LUK 4:24 He said, “Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.
LUK 4:25 But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel [God prevails] in the days of Elijah [My God Yah], when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.
LUK 4:26 Elijah [My God Yah] was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
LUK 4:27 There were many people with tzara'at in Israel [God prevails] in the time of Elisha [My God salvation] the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.”
LUK 4:28 They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.
LUK 4:29 They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.
LUK 4:30 But he, passing through the middle of them, went his way.
LUK 4:31 He came down to Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], a city of Galilee [District, Circuit]. He was teaching them on the Sabbath ·To cease· day,
LUK 4:32 and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.
LUK 4:33 In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
LUK 4:34 saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Yeshua [Salvation] of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one]? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: haKadosh Elohim [the Holy One of God]!”
LUK 4:35 Yeshua [Salvation] rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm.
LUK 4:36 Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”
LUK 4:37 News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
LUK 4:38 He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simeon [Hearing]’s house. Simeon [Hearing]’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.
LUK 4:39 He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
LUK 4:40 When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
LUK 4:41 Demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, “You are the Messiah [Anointed one], the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah [Anointed one].
LUK 4:42 When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he would not go away from them.
LUK 4:43 But he said to them, “I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”
LUK 4:44 He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee [District, Circuit].
LUK 5:1 Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard ha D'var Elohim ·the Word of God·, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
LUK 5:2 He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
LUK 5:3 He entered into one of the boats, which was Simeon [Hearing]’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
LUK 5:4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simeon [Hearing], “Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”
LUK 5:5 Simeon [Hearing] answered him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”
LUK 5:6 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.
LUK 5:7 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
LUK 5:8 But Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock], when he saw it, fell down at Yeshua's [Salvation]'s knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·, Lord.”
LUK 5:9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;
LUK 5:10 and so also were James [Surplanter] and John [Yah is gracious], sons of Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah], who were partners with Simeon [Hearing]. Yeshua [Salvation] said to Simeon [Hearing], “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”
LUK 5:11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.
LUK 5:12 While he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of tzara'at ·leprosy·. When he saw Yeshua [Salvation], he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”
LUK 5:13 He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately the tzara'at ·leprosy· left him.
LUK 5:14 He commanded him to tell no one. “Instead, as a testimony to the people, go straight to the priest and make an offer for your cleansing, as Moses [Drawn out] commanded.”
LUK 5:15 But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
LUK 5:16 But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.
LUK 5:17 On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees [Separated] and Torah-Teachers sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee [District, Circuit], Judea [Praise], and Jerusalem [City of peace]. The power of MarYah [Master Yahweh] was with him to heal them.
LUK 5:18 Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Yeshua [Salvation].
LUK 5:19 Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Yeshua [Salvation].
LUK 5:20 Seeing their trusting faith, he said to him, “Man, your abstract sins ·miss the marks· are forgiven you.”
LUK 5:21 The Torah-Teachers and the Pharisees [Separated] began to reason, saying, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive abstract sins ·miss the marks·, but God alone?”
LUK 5:22 But Yeshua [Salvation], perceiving their thoughts, answered them, “Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?
LUK 5:23 Which is easier to say, ‘Your abstract sins ·miss the marks· are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’
LUK 5:24 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive abstract sins ·miss the marks·” (he said to the paralyzed man), “I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.”
LUK 5:25 Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.
LUK 5:26 Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today.”
LUK 5:27 After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi [United with] sitting at the tax office, and said to him, “Follow me!”
LUK 5:28 He left everything, and rose up and followed him.
LUK 5:29 Levi [United with] made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.
LUK 5:30 Their Torah-Teachers and the Pharisees [Separated] murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·?”
LUK 5:31 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
LUK 5:32 I have not come to call the upright, but sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· to teshuvah ·complete repentance·.”
LUK 5:33 They said to him, “Why do John [Yah is gracious]’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees [Separated], but yours eat and drink?”
LUK 5:34 He said to them, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
LUK 5:35 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.”
LUK 5:36 He also told a parable to them. “No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.
LUK 5:37 No one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
LUK 5:38 But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved.
LUK 5:39 No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”
LUK 6:1 Now on the second Sabbath ·To cease· after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
LUK 6:2 But some of the Pharisees [Separated] said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ·To cease· day?”
LUK 6:3 Yeshua [Salvation], answering them, said, “Haven’t you read what David [Beloved] did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;
LUK 6:4 how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread from the table of Yahweh, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”
LUK 6:5 He said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath ·To cease·.”
LUK 6:6 It also happened on another Sabbath ·To cease· that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
LUK 6:7 The Torah-Teachers and the Pharisees [Separated] watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath ·To cease·, that they might find an accusation against him.
LUK 6:8 But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Rise up, and stand in the middle.” He arose and stood.
LUK 6:9 Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath ·To cease· to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”
LUK 6:10 He looked around at them all, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.
LUK 6:11 But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Yeshua [Salvation].
LUK 6:12 In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.
LUK 6:13 When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:
LUK 6:14 Simeon [Hearing], whom he also named Peter [Rock]; Andrew [Manly], his brother; James [Surplanter]; John [Yah is gracious]; Philip [Loves horses]; Bartholomew [Son who suspends waters];
LUK 6:15 Matthew [Gift of Yah]; Thomas [Seeker of truth]; James [Surplanter], the son of Alphaeus [Changing]; Simeon [Hearing], who was called the Zealot [Zealous follower];
LUK 6:16 Judas [Praised] the son of James [Surplanter]; and Judas Iscariot [Praised Dagger-man], who also became a traitor.
LUK 6:17 He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea [Praise] and Jerusalem [City of peace], and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;
LUK 6:18 as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.
LUK 6:19 All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.
LUK 6:20 He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, “Blessed are you who are poor, God’s Kingdom is yours.
LUK 6:21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
LUK 6:22 Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.
LUK 6:23 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.
LUK 6:24 “But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.
LUK 6:25 Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
LUK 6:26 Woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.
LUK 6:27 “But I tell you who hear: show agapao ·total devotion love· to your enemies, do good to those who hate and detest you,
LUK 6:28 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.
LUK 6:29 To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also.
LUK 6:30 Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.
LUK 6:31 “As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.
LUK 6:32 If you show agapao ·total devoted love· those who show agapao ·total devoted love· you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· show agapao ·total devoted love· to those who show agapao ·total devoted love· to them.
LUK 6:33 If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· do the same.
LUK 6:34 If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· lend to sinners devoted to sin ·miss the marks and be without share in the goal (and stained by definite crime vice)·, to receive back as much.
LUK 6:35 But show agapao ·total devoted love· to your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of haElyon [the Most High]; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
LUK 6:36 “Therefore be merciful, even as 'Avikah ·your Father· is also merciful.
LUK 6:37 Don’t judge, and you won’t be judged. Don’t condemn, and you won’t be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.
LUK 6:38 “Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you.”
LUK 6:39 He spoke a parable to them. “Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit?
LUK 6:40 A disciple is not above his Rabbi ·Teacher·, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his Rabbi ·Teacher·.
LUK 6:41 Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?
LUK 6:42 Or how can you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye.
LUK 6:43 For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that produces good fruit.
LUK 6:44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
LUK 6:45 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.
LUK 6:46 “Why do you call me, ‘Master, Lord,’ and don’t do the things which I say?
LUK 6:47 Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.
LUK 6:48 He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.
LUK 6:49 But he who hears, and does not do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”
LUK 7:1 After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion].
LUK 7:2 A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.
LUK 7:3 When he heard about Yeshua [Salvation], he sent to him elders of the Jews [Praisers], asking him to come and save his servant.
LUK 7:4 When they came to Yeshua [Salvation], they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him,
LUK 7:5 for he has agapao ·total devotion love· towards our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”
LUK 7:6 Yeshua [Salvation] went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.
LUK 7:7 Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.
LUK 7:8 For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
LUK 7:9 When Yeshua [Salvation] heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great trusting faith, no, not in Israel [God prevails].”
LUK 7:10 Those who were sent, teshuvah ·completely returning· to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.
LUK 7:11 Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.
LUK 7:12 Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.
LUK 7:13 When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, “Don’t cry.”
LUK 7:14 He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I tell you, arise!”
LUK 7:15 He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
LUK 7:16 Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited his people!”
LUK 7:17 This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea [Praise], and in all the surrounding region.
LUK 7:18 The disciples of John [Yah is gracious] told him about all these things.
LUK 7:19 John [Yah is gracious], calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Yeshua [Salvation], saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?”
LUK 7:20 When the men had come to him, they said, “John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’”
LUK 7:21 In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.
LUK 7:22 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Go and tell John [Yah is gracious] the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the people afflicted with tzara'at ·leprosy· are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
LUK 7:23 Blessed is he who finds no occasion for being scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant· in me.”
LUK 7:24 When John [Yah is gracious]’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John [Yah is gracious], “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
LUK 7:25 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.
LUK 7:26 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
LUK 7:27 This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’
LUK 7:28 “For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser, yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.”
LUK 7:29 When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been immersed with John [Yah is gracious]’s mikvah ·ritual washing baptism·.
LUK 7:30 But the Pharisees [Separated] and the Torah-experts rejected ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· the counsel of God, not being immersed by him themselves.
LUK 7:31 “To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?
LUK 7:32 They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’
LUK 7:33 For John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’
LUK 7:34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· devoted to sin ·miss the marks and be without share (and stained by definite crime vice)·!’
LUK 7:35 Wisdom is justified by all her children.”
LUK 7:36 One of the Pharisees [Separated] invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee's [Separated]’s house, and sat at the table.
LUK 7:37 Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee's [Separated]’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.
LUK 7:38 Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
LUK 7:39 Now when the Pharisee [Separated] who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·.”
LUK 7:40 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Simeon [Hearing], I have something to tell you.” He said, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, say on.”
LUK 7:41 “A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii (500 days wages), and the other fifty denarii (50 days wages).
LUK 7:42 When they couldn’t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will show agapao ·total devotion love· to him most?”
LUK 7:43 Simeon [Hearing] answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.” He said to him, “You have judged correctly.”
LUK 7:44 Turning to the woman, he said to Simeon [Hearing], “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.
LUK 7:45 You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
LUK 7:46 You didn’t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
LUK 7:47 Therefore I tell you, her abstract sins ·miss the marks·, which are many, are forgiven, for she showed agapao ·totally devoted love· much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same shows little agapao ·totally devoted love·.”
LUK 7:48 He said to her, “Your abstract sins ·miss the marks· are forgiven.”
LUK 7:49 Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives abstract sins ·miss the marks·?”
LUK 7:50 He said to the woman, “Your trusting faith has saved you. Go in peace.”
LUK 8:1 Soon afterwards, he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of God’s Kingdom. With him were the twelve,
LUK 8:2 and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary [Rebellion] who was called Magdalene [City tower], from whom seven demons had gone out;
LUK 8:3 and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod [Heroic]’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.
LUK 8:4 When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.
LUK 8:5 “The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.
LUK 8:6 Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
LUK 8:7 Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.
LUK 8:8 Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·!”
LUK 8:9 Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”
LUK 8:10 He said, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’
LUK 8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is ha D'var Elohim ·the Word of God·.
LUK 8:12 Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil [Accuser] comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not trust and be saved.
LUK 8:13 Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who trust for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.
LUK 8:14 That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.
LUK 8:15 That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produces fruit with patience.
LUK 8:16 “No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.
LUK 8:17 For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.
LUK 8:18 Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”
LUK 8:19 His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.
LUK 8:20 Some people told him, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.”
LUK 8:21 But he answered them, “My mother and my brothers are these who hear ha D'var Elohim ·the Word of God·, and do it.”
LUK 8:22 Now on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.
LUK 8:23 But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.
LUK 8:24 They came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Rabbi, Rabbi! ·Teacher, Teacher!· We are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.
LUK 8:25 He said to them, “Where is your trusting faith?” Being afraid they marveled, saying to one another, “Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”
LUK 8:26 They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee [District, Circuit].
LUK 8:27 When Yeshua [Salvation] stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.
LUK 8:28 When he saw Yeshua [Salvation], he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Yeshua [Salvation], you Son of the Elyon El [Most High God]? I beg you, don’t torment me!”
LUK 8:29 For Yeshua [Salvation] was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.
LUK 8:30 Yeshua [Salvation] asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.
LUK 8:31 They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss, the bottomless netherworld.
LUK 8:32 Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.
LUK 8:33 The demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.
LUK 8:34 When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
LUK 8:35 People went out to see what had happened. They came to Yeshua [Salvation], and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Yeshua's [Salvation]'s feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
LUK 8:36 Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.
LUK 8:37 All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and teshuvah ·completely returned·.
LUK 8:38 But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Yeshua [Salvation] sent him away, saying,
LUK 8:39 “Teshuvah ·Completely return· to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Yeshua [Salvation] had done for him.
LUK 8:40 When Yeshua [Salvation] teshuvah ·completely returned·, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
LUK 8:41 Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Yeshua's [Salvation]'s feet, and begged him to come into his house,
LUK 8:42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.
LUK 8:43 A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, she had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,
LUK 8:44 came behind him, and touched the tzitzit ·fringes· of his outer cloak, his prayer shawl, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.
LUK 8:45 Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter [Rock] and those with him said, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”
LUK 8:46 But Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”
LUK 8:47 When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
LUK 8:48 He said to her, “Daughter, cheer up. Your trusting faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
LUK 8:49 While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Rabbi ·Teacher·.”
LUK 8:50 But Yeshua [Salvation] hearing it, answered him, “Don’t be afraid. Only trust, and she will be healed.”
LUK 8:51 When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter [Rock], John [Yah is gracious], James [Surplanter], the Abba [dear father] of the child, and her mother.
LUK 8:52 All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, “Don’t weep. She is not dead, but sleeping.”
LUK 8:53 They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.
LUK 8:54 But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, “Child, arise!”
LUK 8:55 Her spirit teshuvah ·completely returned·, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
LUK 8:56 Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
LUK 9:1 He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
LUK 9:2 He sent them out to preach God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick.
LUK 9:3 He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey— neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.
LUK 9:4 Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.
LUK 9:5 As many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”
LUK 9:6 They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.
LUK 9:7 Now Herod [Heroic] the tetrarch (one of four co-emperors) heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John [Yah is gracious] had risen from the dead,
LUK 9:8 and by some that Elijah [My God Yah] had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
LUK 9:9 Herod [Heroic] said, “John [Yah is gracious] I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him.
LUK 9:10 The apostles, when they had teshuvah ·completely returned·, told him what things they had done. He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.
LUK 9:11 But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing.
LUK 9:12 The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”
LUK 9:13 But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”
LUK 9:14 For they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”
LUK 9:15 They did so, and made them all sit down.
LUK 9:16 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
LUK 9:17 They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
LUK 9:18 As he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them, “Who do the multitudes say that I am?”
LUK 9:19 They answered, “‘John [Yah is gracious] the Immerser,’ but others say, ‘Elijah [My God Yah],’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.”
LUK 9:20 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter [Rock] answered, “The Messiah [Anointed one] of God.”
LUK 9:21 But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,
LUK 9:22 saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and Torah-Teachers, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”
LUK 9:23 He said to all, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his execution-stake, and follow me.
LUK 9:24 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.
LUK 9:25 For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?
LUK 9:26 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Abba Father, and of the holy angels.
LUK 9:27 But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see God’s Kingdom.”
LUK 9:28 About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter [Rock], John [Yah is gracious], and James [Surplanter], and went up onto the mountain to pray.
LUK 9:29 As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
LUK 9:30 Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses [Drawn out] and Elijah [My God Yah],
LUK 9:31 who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem [City of peace].
LUK 9:32 Now Peter [Rock] and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.
LUK 9:33 As they were parting from him, Peter [Rock] said to Yeshua [Salvation], “Rabbi ·Teacher·, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses [Drawn out], and one for Elijah [My God Yah],” not knowing what he said.
LUK 9:34 While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
LUK 9:35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”
LUK 9:36 When the voice came, Yeshua [Salvation] was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
LUK 9:37 On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
LUK 9:38 Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
LUK 9:39 Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.
LUK 9:40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”
LUK 9:41 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”
LUK 9:42 While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Yeshua [Salvation] rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
LUK 9:43 They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Yeshua [Salvation] did, he said to his disciples,
LUK 9:44 “Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”
LUK 9:45 But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
LUK 9:46 There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.
LUK 9:47 Yeshua [Salvation], perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,
LUK 9:48 and said to them, “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”
LUK 9:49 John [Yah is gracious] answered, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.”
LUK 9:50 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”
LUK 9:51 It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem [City of peace],
LUK 9:52 and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans [people from Watch-mountain], so as to prepare for him.
LUK 9:53 They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem [City of peace].
LUK 9:54 When his disciples, James [Surplanter] and John [Yah is gracious], saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah [My God Yah] did?”
LUK 9:55 But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are.
LUK 9:56 For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” They went to another village.
LUK 9:57 As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”
LUK 9:58 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
LUK 9:59 He said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
LUK 9:60 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.”
LUK 9:61 Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”
LUK 9:62 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.”
LUK 10:1 .Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place, where he was about to come.
LUK 10:2 Then he said to them, “The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.
LUK 10:3 Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
LUK 10:4 Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.
LUK 10:5 Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Shalom ·Complete peace· be to this house.’
LUK 10:6 If a seeker of shalom ·complete peace· is there, your shalom ·complete peace· will find its rest with him; and if there isn't, it will teshuvah ·completely return· to you.
LUK 10:7 Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Don’t go from house to house.
LUK 10:8 Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.
LUK 10:9 Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, ‘God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’
LUK 10:10 But into whatever city you enter, and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say,
LUK 10:11 ‘Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that God’s Kingdom has come near to you.’
LUK 10:12 I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom [Burning] than for that city.
LUK 10:13 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have made teshuvah ·complete repentance· long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
LUK 10:14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
LUK 10:15 You, Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades / Sh'ol ·Place of the dead·.
LUK 10:16 Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever refuses ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· you also refuses ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· me. Whoever refuses ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· me also refuses ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· him who sent me.”
LUK 10:17 The seventy teshuvah ·completely returned· with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!”
LUK 10:18 He said to them, “I saw Satan [Adversary] having fallen like lightning from heaven.
LUK 10:19 Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way do any unjust criminal action sin ·miss the mark and is without share in the goal· against you.
LUK 10:20 Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”
LUK 10:21 In that same hour Yeshua [Salvation] rejoiced in Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness], and said, “I thank you, O Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”
LUK 10:22 Turning to the disciples, he said, “All things have been delivered to me by 'Avi ·my Father·. No one knows who the Son is, except the Abba Father, and who the Abba Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”
LUK 10:23 Turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,
LUK 10:24 for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.”
LUK 10:25 Behold, a certain Torah-expert stood up and tested him, saying, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK 10:26 He said to him, “What is written in the Torah ·Teaching·? How do you read it?”
LUK 10:27 He answered, “You shall have agapao ·total devotion love· to MarYah [Master Yahweh] your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.”
LUK 10:28 He said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”
LUK 10:29 But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Yeshua [Salvation], “Who is my neighbor?”
LUK 10:30 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem [City of peace] to Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
LUK 10:31 By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
LUK 10:32 In the same way a Levite [Descendant of United with] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
LUK 10:33 But a certain Samaritan [person from Watch-mountain], as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
LUK 10:34 came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
LUK 10:35 On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii (2 days wages), and gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I teshuvah ·completely return·.’
LUK 10:36 Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”
LUK 10:37 He said, “He who showed eleos ·merciful compassion in action· on him.” Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Go and do likewise.”
LUK 10:38 As they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] received him into her house.
LUK 10:39 She had a sister called Mary [Rebellion], who also sat at Yeshua's [Salvation]'s feet, and heard his word.
LUK 10:40 But Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.”
LUK 10:41 Yeshua [Salvation] answered her, “Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness], Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness], you are anxious and troubled about many things,
LUK 10:42 but one thing is needed. Mary [Rebellion] has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”
LUK 11:1 When he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John [Yah is gracious] also taught his disciples.”
LUK 11:2 He said to them, “When you pray, say, Avinu shebashamayim ·our Father in Heaven·, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
LUK 11:3 Provide us, day by day, our daily bread.
LUK 11:4 Forgive us our abstract sins ·miss the marks·, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Do not lead us into hard testing, but deliver us from the evil one.’”
LUK 11:5 He said to them, “Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
LUK 11:6 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’
LUK 11:7 and he from within will answer and say, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’?
LUK 11:8 I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.
LUK 11:9 “I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.
LUK 11:10 For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
LUK 11:11 “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
LUK 11:12 Or if he asks for an egg, he won’t give him a scorpion, will he?
LUK 11:13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] to those who ask him?”
LUK 11:14 He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.
LUK 11:15 But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Ba'al-Zibbul [Lord of Flies], the prince of the demons.”
LUK 11:16 Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.
LUK 11:17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.
LUK 11:18 If Satan [Adversary] also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Ba'al-Zibbul [Lord of Flies].
LUK 11:19 But if I cast out demons by Ba'al-Zibbul [Lord of Flies], by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.
LUK 11:20 But if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.
LUK 11:21 “When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.
LUK 11:22 But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.
LUK 11:23 “He that is not with me is against me. He who does not gather with me scatters.
LUK 11:24 The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’
LUK 11:25 When he teshuvah ·completely returns·, he finds it swept and put in order.
LUK 11:26 Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”
LUK 11:27 It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!”
LUK 11:28 But he said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear ha D'var Elohim ·the Word of God·, and keep it.”
LUK 11:29 When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, “This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah [Dove], the prophet.
LUK 11:30 For even as Jonah [Dove] became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
LUK 11:31 The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense]; and behold, one greater than Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense] is here.
LUK 11:32 The men of Nineveh [Offspring’s Habitation] will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they made teshuvah ·complete repentance· at the preaching of Jonah [Dove], and behold, one greater than Jonah [Dove] is here.
LUK 11:33 “No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.
LUK 11:34 The lamp candle of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.
LUK 11:35 Therefore see whether the light that is in you is not darkness.
LUK 11:36 If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp candle with its bright shining gives you light.”
LUK 11:37 Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee [Separated] asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.
LUK 11:38 When the Pharisee [Separated] saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
LUK 11:39 The Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees [Separated] cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
LUK 11:40 You foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?
LUK 11:41 But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.
LUK 11:42 But woe to you Pharisees [Separated]! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s agape ·unconditional love·. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
LUK 11:43 Woe to you Pharisees [Separated]! For you have agapao ·totally devoted love· towards the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.
LUK 11:44 Woe to you, Torah-Teachers and Pharisees [Separated], hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”
LUK 11:45 One of the Torah-experts answered him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, in saying this you insult us also.”
LUK 11:46 He said, “Woe to you Torah-experts also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.
LUK 11:47 Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
LUK 11:48 So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.
LUK 11:49 Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,
LUK 11:50 that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
LUK 11:51 from the blood of Abel [Vanity, Mourning] to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
LUK 11:52 Woe to you Torah-experts! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”
LUK 11:53 As he said these things to them, the Torah-Teachers and the Pharisees [Separated] began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;
LUK 11:54 lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.
LUK 12:1 Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, “Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees [Separated], which is hypocrisy.
LUK 12:2 But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
LUK 12:3 Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.
LUK 12:4 “I tell you, my friends, don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
LUK 12:5 But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna (Place of fiery torment for the dead). Yes, I tell you, fear him.
LUK 12:6 “Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria coins (a trivial cost)? Not one of them is forgotten by God.
LUK 12:7 But the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
LUK 12:8 “I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;
LUK 12:9 but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
LUK 12:10 Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] will not be forgiven.
LUK 12:11 When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don’t be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;
LUK 12:12 for Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness] will teach you in that same hour what you must say.”
LUK 12:13 One of the multitude said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
LUK 12:14 But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”
LUK 12:15 He said to them, “Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man’s life does not consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses.”
LUK 12:16 He spoke a parable to them, saying, “The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly.
LUK 12:17 He reasoned within himself, saying, ‘What will I do, because I don’t have room to store my crops?’
LUK 12:18 He said, ‘This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
LUK 12:19 I will tell my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.”’
LUK 12:20 “But God said to him, ‘You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared— whose will they be?’
LUK 12:21 So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”
LUK 12:22 He said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.
LUK 12:23 Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
LUK 12:24 Consider the ravens: they don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
LUK 12:25 Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit [18 in; 45.72 cm] to his height?
LUK 12:26 If then you are not able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?
LUK 12:27 Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense] in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
LUK 12:28 But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little trusting faith?
LUK 12:29 Don’t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.
LUK 12:30 For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but 'Avikah ·your Father· knows that you need these things.
LUK 12:31 But seek God’s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.
LUK 12:32 Don’t be afraid, little flock, for it is 'Avikah ·your Father·’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.
LUK 12:33 Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.
LUK 12:34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
LUK 12:35 “Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning.
LUK 12:36 Be like men watching for their lord, when he teshuvah ·completely returns· from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.
LUK 12:37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.
LUK 12:38 They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
LUK 12:39 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.
LUK 12:40 Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”
LUK 12:41 Peter [Rock] said to him, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?”
LUK 12:42 The Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?
LUK 12:43 Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.
LUK 12:44 Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.
LUK 12:45 But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,
LUK 12:46 then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not expecting him, and in an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.
LUK 12:47 That servant, who knew his lord’s will, and didn’t prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,
LUK 12:48 but he who didn’t know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.
LUK 12:49 “I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.
LUK 12:50 But I have an immersion to be immersed with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!
LUK 12:51 Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.
LUK 12:52 For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
LUK 12:53 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”
LUK 12:54 He said to the multitudes also, “When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it happens.
LUK 12:55 When a south wind blows, you say, ‘There will be a scorching heat,’ and it happens.
LUK 12:56 You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don’t interpret this time?
LUK 12:57 Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?
LUK 12:58 For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
LUK 12:59 I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny.”
LUK 13:1 Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate [Armed with javelin] had mixed with their sacrifices.
LUK 13:2 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?
LUK 13:3 I tell you, no, but unless you make teshuvah ·complete repentance·, you will all perish in the same way.
LUK 13:4 Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse debt offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem [City of peace]?
LUK 13:5 I tell you, no, but, unless you teshuvah ·turn repent·, you will all perish in the same way.”
LUK 13:6 He spoke this parable. “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.
LUK 13:7 He said to the vine dresser, ‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’
LUK 13:8 He answered, ‘Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.
LUK 13:9 If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.’”
LUK 13:10 He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath ·To cease· day.
LUK 13:11 Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.
LUK 13:12 When Yeshua [Salvation] saw her, he called her, and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”
LUK 13:13 He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.
LUK 13:14 The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Yeshua [Salvation] had healed on the Sabbath ·To cease·, said to the multitude, “There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath ·To cease· day!”
LUK 13:15 Therefore the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Does not each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath ·To cease·, and lead him away to water?
LUK 13:16 Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham [Father of a multitude], whom Satan [Adversary] had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath ·To cease· day?”
LUK 13:17 As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
LUK 13:18 He said, “What is God’s Kingdom like? To what shall I compare it?
LUK 13:19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky live in its branches.”
LUK 13:20 Again he said, “To what shall I compare God’s Kingdom?
LUK 13:21 It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.”
LUK 13:22 He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem [City of peace].
LUK 13:23 One said to him, “Lord, are they few who are saved?” He said to them,
LUK 13:24 “Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.
LUK 13:25 When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Master, Lord, open to us!’ then he will answer and tell you, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’
LUK 13:26 Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’
LUK 13:27 He will say, ‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of sin ·legal injustice that misses the mark and is without share in the goal·.’
LUK 13:28 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham [Father of a multitude], Isaac [Laughter], Jacob [Supplanter], and all the prophets, in God’s Kingdom, and yourselves being thrown outside.
LUK 13:29 They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in God’s Kingdom.
LUK 13:30 Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last.”
LUK 13:31 On that same day, some Pharisees [Separated] came, saying to him, “Get out of here, and go away, for Herod [Heroic] wants to kill you.”
LUK 13:32 He said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission .
LUK 13:33 Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can’t be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem [City of peace].’
LUK 13:34 “Jerusalem [City of peace], Jerusalem [City of peace], that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!
LUK 13:35 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of MarYah [Master Yahweh]!’”
LUK 14:1 When he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees [Separated] on a Sabbath ·To cease· to eat bread, they were watching him.
LUK 14:2 Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.
LUK 14:3 Yeshua [Salvation], answering, spoke to the Torah-experts and Pharisees [Separated], saying, “Does the Torah ·Teaching· allow healing on the Sabbath ·To cease· or not?”
LUK 14:4 But they were silent. He took him, and healed him, and let him go.
LUK 14:5 He answered them, “Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath ·To cease· day?”
LUK 14:6 They couldn’t answer him regarding these things.
LUK 14:7 He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,
LUK 14:8 “When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don’t sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,
LUK 14:9 and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this person.’ Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
LUK 14:10 But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.
LUK 14:11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”
LUK 14:12 He also said to the one who had invited him, “When you make a dinner or a supper, don’t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also teshuvah ·completely return· the favor, and pay you back.
LUK 14:13 But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;
LUK 14:14 and you will be blessed, because they don’t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the upright.”
LUK 14:15 When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is he who will feast in God’s Kingdom!”
LUK 14:16 But he said to him, “A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people.
LUK 14:17 He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now.’
LUK 14:18 They all as one began to make excuses. “The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’
LUK 14:19 “Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.’
LUK 14:20 “Another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’
LUK 14:21 “That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’
LUK 14:22 “The servant said, ‘Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’
LUK 14:23 “The lord said to the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
LUK 14:24 For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.’”
LUK 14:25 Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them,
LUK 14:26 “If anyone comes to me, and does not disregard his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can’t be my disciple.
LUK 14:27 Whoever does not bear his own execution-stake, and come after me, can’t be my disciple.
LUK 14:28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?
LUK 14:29 Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,
LUK 14:30 saying, ‘This man began to build, and was not able to finish.’
LUK 14:31 Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
LUK 14:32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.
LUK 14:33 So therefore whoever of you who does not renounce all that he has, he can’t be my disciple.
LUK 14:34 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?
LUK 14:35 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him sh'ma ·hear obey·.”
LUK 15:1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· were coming close to him to hear him.
LUK 15:2 The Pharisees [Separated] and the Torah-Teachers murmured, saying, “This man welcomes sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·, and eats with them.”
LUK 15:3 He told them this parable.
LUK 15:4 “Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?
LUK 15:5 When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
LUK 15:6 When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’
LUK 15:7 I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· who does teshuvah ·turn repent·, than over ninety-nine upright people who need no teshuvah ·complete repentance·.
LUK 15:8 Or what woman, if she had ten drachma [est. 0.35 oz; est. 10 g] coins, if she lost one drachma [est. 0.035 oz; est. 1 g] coin, wouldn’t light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
LUK 15:9 When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma [est. 0.035 oz; est. 1 g] which I had lost.’
LUK 15:10 Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· making teshuvah ·complete repentance·.”
LUK 15:11 He said, “A certain man had two sons.
LUK 15:12 The younger of them said to his father, ‘Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, give me my share of your property.’ He divided his livelihood between them.
LUK 15:13 Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living.
LUK 15:14 When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.
LUK 15:15 He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
LUK 15:16 He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.
LUK 15:17 But when he came to himself he said, ‘How many hired servants of my Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· have bread enough to spare, and I’m dying with hunger!
LUK 15:18 I will get up and go to my Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, and will tell him, “ Abba ·Father·, I have committed sin ·miss the mark and be without share· against heaven, and in your sight.
LUK 15:19 I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’
LUK 15:20 “He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
LUK 15:21 The son said to him, ‘ Abba ·Father·, I have committed sin ·miss the mark and be without share· against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
LUK 15:22 “But the Abba father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.
LUK 15:23 Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;
LUK 15:24 for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ They began to celebrate.
LUK 15:25 “Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
LUK 15:26 He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.
LUK 15:27 He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.’
LUK 15:28 But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.
LUK 15:29 But he answered his Abba father, ‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.
LUK 15:30 But when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’
LUK 15:31 “He said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
LUK 15:32 But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’”
LUK 16:1 He also said to his disciples, “There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.
LUK 16:2 He called him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’
LUK 16:3 “The manager said within himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.
LUK 16:4 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.’
LUK 16:5 Calling each one of his lord’s debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my lord?’
LUK 16:6 He said, ‘One hundred batos [800 Gal; 3,028 L] of oil.’ ‘Take your note back,’ he told him. ‘Now, quickly! Sit down and write one for fifty [400 Gal; 1,514 L]!’
LUK 16:7 Then he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ He said, ‘One thousand bushels of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your note back and write one for eight hundred.’
LUK 16:8 “His lord commended the sinful ·legal injustice that misses the mark and is without share in the goal· manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
LUK 16:9 I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of sinful ·legal injustice that misses the mark and is without share in the goal· mammon ·wealth·, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.
LUK 16:10 He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.
LUK 16:11 If therefore you have not been faithful in the trecherous mammon ·wealth·, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
LUK 16:12 If you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?
LUK 16:13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and show agapao ·total devotion love· to the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and Mammon ·Wealth·.”
LUK 16:14 The Pharisees [Separated], who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.
LUK 16:15 He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
LUK 16:16 The Torah ·Teaching· and the Prophets were until John [Yah is gracious]. Since then the Good News of God’s Kingdom is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
LUK 16:17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the Torah ·Teaching· become void.
LUK 16:18 Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another moicheuo ·commits adultery·. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband moicheuo ·commits adultery·.
LUK 16:19 “Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.
LUK 16:20 A certain beggar, named Lazarus [Help of God], was laid at his gate, full of sores,
LUK 16:21 and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
LUK 16:22 The beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.
LUK 16:23 In Hades / Sh'ol ·Place of the dead·, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham [Father of a multitude] far off, and Lazarus [Help of God] at Abraham's bosom, (the righteous side of Sheol).
LUK 16:24 He cried and said, ‘Father Abraham [Father of a multitude], have mercy on me, and send Lazarus [Help of God], that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.’
LUK 16:25 “But Abraham [Father of a multitude] said, ‘Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus [Help of God], in the same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish.
LUK 16:26 Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that no one may cross over from there to us.’
LUK 16:27 “He said, ‘I ask you therefore, Abba father, that you would send him to 'Avi ·my Father·’s house;
LUK 16:28 for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won’t also come into this place of torment.’
LUK 16:29 “But Abraham [Father of a multitude] said to him, ‘They have Moses [Drawn out] and the prophets. Let them listen to them.’
LUK 16:30 “He said, ‘No, Abba father Abraham [Father of a multitude], but if one goes to them from the dead, they will make teshuvah ·complete repentance·.’
LUK 16:31 “He said to him, ‘If they don’t listen to Moses [Drawn out] and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.’”
LUK 17:1 He said to the disciples, “It is impossible that no occasions of sins ·scandals, trap snares, entrapments· should come, but woe to him through whom they come!
LUK 17:2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·.
LUK 17:3 Be careful. If your brother commits sin ·miss the mark and be without share· against you, rebuke him. If he makes teshuvah ·complete repentance·, forgive him.
LUK 17:4 If he commits sin ·miss the mark and be without share· against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I make teshuvah ·complete repentance·,’ you shall forgive him.”
LUK 17:5 The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our trusting faith.”
LUK 17:6 The Lord said, “If you had trusting faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.
LUK 17:7 But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’
LUK 17:8 and will not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?
LUK 17:9 Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.
LUK 17:10 Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’”
LUK 17:11 As he was on his way to Jerusalem [City of peace], he was passing along the borders of Samaria [Watch-mountain] and Galilee [District, Circuit].
LUK 17:12 As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were afflicted with tzara'at ·leprosy· met him, who stood at a distance.
LUK 17:13 They lifted up their voices, saying, “Yeshua [Salvation], Rabbi ·Teacher·, have mercy on us!”
LUK 17:14 When he saw them, he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” As they went, they were cleansed.
LUK 17:15 One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.
LUK 17:16 He fell on his face at Yeshua's [Salvation]'s feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan [person from Watch-mountain].
LUK 17:17 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?
LUK 17:18 Were there none found who teshuvah ·completely returned· to give glory to God, except this stranger?”
LUK 17:19 Then he said to him, “Get up, and go your way. Your trusting faith has healed you.”
LUK 17:20 Being asked by the Pharisees [Separated] when God’s Kingdom would come, he answered them, “God’s Kingdom does not come with observation;
LUK 17:21 neither will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, God’s Kingdom is within you.”
LUK 17:22 He said to the disciples, “The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
LUK 17:23 They will tell you, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them,
LUK 17:24 for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day.
LUK 17:25 But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
LUK 17:26 As it was in the days of Noah [Rest], even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man.
LUK 17:27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah [Rest] entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
LUK 17:28 Likewise, even as it was in the days of Lot [Veil, Covering]: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
LUK 17:29 but in the day that Lot [Veil, Covering] went out from Sodom [Burning], Yahweh caused it to rain fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.
LUK 17:30 It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
LUK 17:31 In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back.
LUK 17:32 Remember Lot [Veil, Covering]’s wife!
LUK 17:33 Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it.
LUK 17:34 I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.
LUK 17:35 There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left.
LUK 17:36 Two will be in the field: the one taken, and the other left.”
LUK 17:37 They, answering, asked him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, “Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together.”
LUK 18:1 He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,
LUK 18:2 saying, “There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect man.
LUK 18:3 A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’
LUK 18:4 He wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,
LUK 18:5 yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’”
LUK 18:6 The Lord said, “Listen to what the sinful ·legal injustice that misses the mark and is without share in the goal· judge says.
LUK 18:7 Won’t God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?
LUK 18:8 I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find trusting faith on the earth?”
LUK 18:9 He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.
LUK 18:10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee [Separated], and the other was a tax collector.
LUK 18:11 The Pharisee [Separated] stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, moichoi ·adulterers·, or even like this tax collector.
LUK 18:12 I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’
LUK 18:13 But the tax collector, standing far away, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·!’
LUK 18:14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”
LUK 18:15 They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
LUK 18:16 Yeshua [Salvation] summoned them, saying, “Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these.
LUK 18:17 Most certainly, I tell you, whoever does not receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”
LUK 18:18 A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Rabbi ·Teacher·, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”
LUK 18:19 Yeshua [Salvation] asked him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one— God’s Torah ·Teaching·.
LUK 18:20 You know the mitzvot ·instructions·: ‘Don’t moicheuo ·commit adultery·,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’”
LUK 18:21 He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.”
LUK 18:22 When Yeshua [Salvation] heard these things, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.”
LUK 18:23 But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
LUK 18:24 Yeshua [Salvation], seeing that he became very sad, said, “How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!
LUK 18:25 For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye (small door of city gate), than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”
LUK 18:26 Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”
LUK 18:27 But he said, “The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”
LUK 18:28 Peter [Rock] said, “Look, we have left everything, and followed you.”
LUK 18:29 He said to them, “Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake,
LUK 18:30 who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”
LUK 18:31 He took the twelve aside, and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem [City of peace], and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed.
LUK 18:32 For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.
LUK 18:33 They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.”
LUK 18:34 They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said.
LUK 18:35 As he came near Jericho [Fragrant, Moon], a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.
LUK 18:36 Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.
LUK 18:37 They told him that Yeshua [Salvation] of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one] was passing by.
LUK 18:38 He cried out, “Yeshua [Salvation], you son of David [Beloved], have mercy on me!”
LUK 18:39 Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of David [Beloved], have mercy on me!”
LUK 18:40 Standing still, Yeshua [Salvation] commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,
LUK 18:41 “What do you want me to do?” He said, “Lord, that I may see again.”
LUK 18:42 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Receive your sight. Your trusting faith has healed you.”
LUK 18:43 Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.
LUK 19:1 He entered and was passing through Jericho [Fragrant, Moon].
LUK 19:2 There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
LUK 19:3 He was trying to see who Yeshua [Salvation] was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short.
LUK 19:4 He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was going to pass that way.
LUK 19:5 When Yeshua [Salvation] came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”
LUK 19:6 He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully.
LUK 19:7 When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·.”
LUK 19:8 Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.”
LUK 19:9 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Today, yishu'ah ·salvation· has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham [Father of a multitude].
LUK 19:10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.”
LUK 19:11 As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem [City of peace], and they supposed that God’s Kingdom would be revealed immediately.
LUK 19:12 He said therefore, “A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to teshuvah ·completely return·.
LUK 19:13 He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina [500 sheckles; 12.5 lb; 5.67 kg] coins, and told them, ‘Conduct business until I come.’
LUK 19:14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’
LUK 19:15 “When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.
LUK 19:16 The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina [50 sheckles; 1.25 lb; 0.57 kg] has made ten more minas [500 sheckles; 12.5 lb; 5.67 kg].’
LUK 19:17 “He said to him, ‘Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
LUK 19:18 “The second came, saying, ‘Your mina [50 sheckles; 1.25 lb; 0.57 kg], Lord, has made five minas [250 sheckles; 6.25 lb; 2.835 kg].’
LUK 19:19 “So he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’
LUK 19:20 Another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, your mina [50 sheckles; 1.25 lb; 0.57 kg], which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,
LUK 19:21 for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’
LUK 19:22 “He said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that which I didn’t sow.
LUK 19:23 Then why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’
LUK 19:24 He said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina [50 sheckles; 1.25 lb; 0.57 kg] away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas [500 sheckles; 12.5 lb; 5.67 kg].’
LUK 19:25 “They said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas [500 sheckles; 12.5 lb; 5.7 kg]!’
LUK 19:26 ‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
LUK 19:27 But bring those enemies of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.’”
LUK 19:28 Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem [City of peace].
LUK 19:29 When he came near to Bethsphage and Bethany [House of affliction], at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,
LUK 19:30 saying, “Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it.
LUK 19:31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say to him: ‘The Lord needs it.’”
LUK 19:32 Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them.
LUK 19:33 As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
LUK 19:34 They said, “The Lord needs it.”
LUK 19:35 They brought it to Yeshua [Salvation]. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Yeshua [Salvation] on them.
LUK 19:36 As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road.
LUK 19:37 As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
LUK 19:38 saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of MarYah [Master Yahweh]! Shalom ·Complete peace· in heaven, and glory in the highest places!”
LUK 19:39 Some of the Pharisees [Separated] from the multitude said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, rebuke your disciples!”
LUK 19:40 He answered them, “I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.”
LUK 19:41 When he came near, he saw the city and wept over it,
LUK 19:42 saying, “If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your shalom ·complete peace·! But now, they are hidden from your eyes.
LUK 19:43 For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,
LUK 19:44 and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didn’t know the time of your visitation.”
LUK 19:45 He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
LUK 19:46 saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house is a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of robbers’!”
LUK 19:47 He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the Torah-Teachers and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him.
LUK 19:48 They couldn’t find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.
LUK 20:1 On one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, the priests and Torah-Teachers came to him with the elders.
LUK 20:2 They asked him, “Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?”
LUK 20:3 He answered them, “I also will ask you one question. Tell me:
LUK 20:4 the mikvah ·ritual washing baptism· of John [Yah is gracious], was it from heaven, or from men?”
LUK 20:5 They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you trust him?’
LUK 20:6 But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John [Yah is gracious] was a prophet.”
LUK 20:7 They answered that they didn’t know where it was from.
LUK 20:8 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”
LUK 20:9 He began to tell the people this parable. “A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.
LUK 20:10 At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
LUK 20:11 He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
LUK 20:12 He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.
LUK 20:13 The lord of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my agapetos ·beloved, esteemed· son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.’
LUK 20:14 “But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’
LUK 20:15 They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
LUK 20:16 He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.” When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!”
LUK 20:17 But he looked at them, and said, “Then what is this that is written, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief corner-stone' ?
LUK 20:18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.”
LUK 20:19 The chief priests and the Torah-Teachers sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people— for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.
LUK 20:20 They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be upright, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.
LUK 20:21 They asked him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we know that you say and teach what is right, and are not partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.
LUK 20:22 Does Torah ·Teaching· permit us to pay taxes to Caesar [Ruler], or not?”
LUK 20:23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, “Why do you test me?
LUK 20:24 Show me a denarius [one day’s wage]. Whose image and inscription are on it?” They answered, “Caesar’s [Ruler]’s.”
LUK 20:25 He said to them, “Then give to Caesar [Ruler] the things that are Caesar’s [Ruler]’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
LUK 20:26 They were not able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.
LUK 20:27 Some of the Sadducees [Morally-upright] came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
LUK 20:28 They asked him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, Moses [Drawn out] wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.
LUK 20:29 There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.
LUK 20:30 The second took her as wife, and he died childless.
LUK 20:31 The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
LUK 20:32 Afterward the woman also died.
LUK 20:33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.”
LUK 20:34 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
LUK 20:35 But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
LUK 20:36 For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.
LUK 20:37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses [Drawn out] showed at the bush, when Yahweh said ‘The God of Abraham [Father of a multitude], the God of Isaac [Laughter], and the God of Jacob [Supplanter].’
LUK 20:38 Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”
LUK 20:39 Some of the Torah-Teachers answered, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, you speak well.”
LUK 20:40 They didn’t dare to ask him any more questions.
LUK 20:41 He said to them, “Why do they say that the Messiah [Anointed one] is David [Beloved]’s son?
LUK 20:42 For David [Beloved] himself says in the book of Psalms [Praises],
LUK 20:43 ‘Yahweh said to 'adoni ·my Lord·, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’
LUK 20:44 “David [Beloved] therefore calls him 'adoni ·my Lord·, in what way can he be his son?”
LUK 20:45 In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
LUK 20:46 “Beware of the Torah-Teachers, who like to walk in long robes, and phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;
LUK 20:47 who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation.”
LUK 21:1 He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.
LUK 21:2 He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small bronze coins.
LUK 21:3 He said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,
LUK 21:4 for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on.”
LUK 21:5 As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,
LUK 21:6 “As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down.”
LUK 21:7 They asked him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?”
LUK 21:8 He said, “Watch out that you don’t get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, ‘Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], I am he,’ and, ‘The time is at hand.’ Therefore don’t follow them.
LUK 21:9 When you hear of wars and disturbances, don’t be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won’t come immediately.”
LUK 21:10 Then he said to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
LUK 21:11 There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
LUK 21:12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake.
LUK 21:13 It will turn out as a testimony for you.
LUK 21:14 Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,
LUK 21:15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.
LUK 21:16 You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death.
LUK 21:17 You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake.
LUK 21:18 And not a hair of your head will perish.
LUK 21:19 “By your endurance you will win your lives.
LUK 21:20 “But when you see Jerusalem [City of peace] surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.
LUK 21:21 Then let those who are in Judea [Praise] flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the middle of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein.
LUK 21:22 For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
LUK 21:23 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people.
LUK 21:24 They will fall by the edge of the machaira ·machete, small sword knife·, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem [City of peace] will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
LUK 21:25 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;
LUK 21:26 men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
LUK 21:27 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
LUK 21:28 But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.”
LUK 21:29 He told them a parable. “See the fig tree, and all the trees.
LUK 21:30 When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.
LUK 21:31 Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that God’s Kingdom is near.
LUK 21:32 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.
LUK 21:33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.
LUK 21:34 “So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.
LUK 21:35 For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.
LUK 21:36 Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”
LUK 21:37 Every day Yeshua [Salvation] was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.
LUK 21:38 All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.
LUK 22:1 Now the festival of Matzah ·Unleavened bread·, also called the Pesac ·Passover·, was approaching.
LUK 22:2 The chief priests and the Torah-Teachers sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
LUK 22:3 Satan [Adversary] entered into Judas [Praised], who was also called Iscariot [Dagger-man], who was counted with the twelve.
LUK 22:4 He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.
LUK 22:5 They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
LUK 22:6 He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.
LUK 22:7 The day of Matzah ·Unleavened bread· came (Nissan 14), on which the Pesac ·Passover· lamb must be sacrificed.
LUK 22:8 He sent Peter [Rock] and John [Yah is gracious], saying, “Go and prepare our Seder ·Order / Passover meal·, that we may eat.”
LUK 22:9 They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”
LUK 22:10 He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.
LUK 22:11 Tell the master of the house, ‘The Rabbi ·Teacher· says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Pesac ·Passover· meal with my disciples?”’
LUK 22:12 He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”
LUK 22:13 They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Seder · Order / Passover meal·.
LUK 22:14 When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.
LUK 22:15 He said to them, “I have earnestly epithumia ·coveted, desired· to eat this Seder · Order / Passover meal· with you before I suffer and die!
LUK 22:16 For I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”
LUK 22:17 He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, “Take this, and share it among yourselves,
LUK 22:18 for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”
LUK 22:19 He took matzah ·unleavened bread·, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”
LUK 22:20 Likewise, he took the (third) cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties· in my blood, which is poured out for you.
LUK 22:21 But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
LUK 22:22 The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”
LUK 22:23 They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
LUK 22:24 There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
LUK 22:25 He said to them, “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’
LUK 22:26 But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.
LUK 22:27 For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Is not it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
LUK 22:28 But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.
LUK 22:29 I confer on you a kingdom, even as 'Avi ·my Father· conferred on me,
LUK 22:30 that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel [God prevails].”
LUK 22:31 The Lord said, “Simeon [Hearing], Simeon [Hearing], behold, Satan [Adversary] asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,
LUK 22:32 but I prayed for you, that your trusting faith would not fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”
LUK 22:33 He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”
LUK 22:34 He said, “I tell you, Peter [Rock], the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”
LUK 22:35 He said to them, “When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.”
LUK 22:36 Then he said to them, “But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a machaira ·machete, small sword knife·.
LUK 22:37 For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with lawless ·not subject to Torah, departing from Torah· people.’ For that which concerns me has an end.”
LUK 22:38 They said, “Lord, behold, here are two machairai ·machetes, small sword knives·.” He said to them, “That is enough.”
LUK 22:39 He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.
LUK 22:40 When he was at the place, he said to them, “Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”
LUK 22:41 He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
LUK 22:42 saying, “ Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”
LUK 22:43 An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
LUK 22:44 Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.
LUK 22:45 When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,
LUK 22:46 and said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
LUK 22:47 While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas [Praised], one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Yeshua [Salvation] to phileo ·show affectionate love, show approval, kiss· him.
LUK 22:48 But Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Judas [Praised], do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”
LUK 22:49 When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the machaira ·machete, small sword knife·?”
LUK 22:50 A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
LUK 22:51 But Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Let me at least do this”— and he touched his ear, and healed him.
LUK 22:52 Yeshua [Salvation] said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with machairon ·machetes, small sword knives· and clubs?
LUK 22:53 When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”
LUK 22:54 They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter [Rock] followed from a distance.
LUK 22:55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter [Rock] sat among them.
LUK 22:56 A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.”
LUK 22:57 He denied Yeshua [Salvation], saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”
LUK 22:58 After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter [Rock] answered, “Man, I am not!”
LUK 22:59 After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!”
LUK 22:60 But Peter [Rock] said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
LUK 22:61 The Lord turned, and looked at Peter [Rock]. Then Peter [Rock] remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”
LUK 22:62 He went out, and wept bitterly.
LUK 22:63 The men who held Yeshua [Salvation] mocked him and beat him.
LUK 22:64 Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”
LUK 22:65 They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
LUK 22:66 As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and Torah-Teachers, and they led him away into their council, saying,
LUK 22:67 “If you are the Messiah [Anointed one], tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t trust,
LUK 22:68 and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.
LUK 22:69 From now on, the Son of Man will be sitting at the right hand of HaG'vurah [The Power (of God)].”
LUK 22:70 They all said, “Are you then the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·?” He said to them, “You say it, because Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)].”
LUK 22:71 They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”
LUK 23:1 The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate [Armed with javelin].
LUK 23:2 They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar [Ruler], and saying that he himself is Messiah [Anointed one], a king.”
LUK 23:3 Pilate [Armed with javelin] asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews [Praisers]?” He answered him, “So you say.”
LUK 23:4 Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
LUK 23:5 But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea [Praise], beginning from Galilee [District, Circuit] even to this place.”
LUK 23:6 But when Pilate [Armed with javelin] heard Galilee [District, Circuit] mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
LUK 23:7 When he found out that he was in Herod [Heroic]’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod [Heroic], who was also in Jerusalem [City of peace] during those days.
LUK 23:8 Now when Herod [Heroic] saw Yeshua [Salvation], he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.
LUK 23:9 He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.
LUK 23:10 The chief priests and the Torah-Teachers stood, vehemently accusing him.
LUK 23:11 Herod [Heroic] with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate [Armed with javelin].
LUK 23:12 Herod [Heroic] and Pilate [Armed with javelin] became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.
LUK 23:13 Pilate [Armed with javelin] called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
LUK 23:14 and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.
LUK 23:15 Neither has Herod [Heroic], for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
LUK 23:16 I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
LUK 23:17 Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
LUK 23:18 But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Bar-Abba [Son Father]!”—
LUK 23:19 one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
LUK 23:20 Then Pilate [Armed with javelin] spoke to them again, wanting to release Yeshua [Salvation],
LUK 23:21 but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”
LUK 23:22 He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
LUK 23:23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be put to death on the stake. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.
LUK 23:24 Pilate [Armed with javelin] decreed that what they asked for should be done.
LUK 23:25 He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Yeshua [Salvation] up to their will.
LUK 23:26 When they led him away, they grabbed one Simeon [Hearing] of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the execution-stake, to carry it after Yeshua [Salvation].
LUK 23:27 A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.
LUK 23:28 But Yeshua [Salvation], turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem [City of peace], don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
LUK 23:29 For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’
LUK 23:30 Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’
LUK 23:31 For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”
LUK 23:32 There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.
LUK 23:33 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they nailed him to a stake; and they nailed the criminals to stakes, one on the right and the other on the left.
LUK 23:34 Yeshua [Salvation] said, “ Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” They divided up his clothes by casting lots.
LUK 23:35 The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Messiah [Anointed one] of God, his chosen one!”
LUK 23:36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
LUK 23:37 and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews [Praisers], save yourself!”
LUK 23:38 An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew [Immigrant]: “This Is The King of The Jews [Praisers] .”
LUK 23:39 One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Messiah [Anointed one], save yourself and us!”
LUK 23:40 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
LUK 23:41 And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”
LUK 23:42 He said to Yeshua [Salvation], “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”
LUK 23:43 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise, (the righteous side of Sheol).”
LUK 23:44 It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three o'clock in the afternoon.
LUK 23:45 The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
LUK 23:46 Yeshua [Salvation], crying with a loud voice, said, “ Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.
LUK 23:47 When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a upright man.”
LUK 23:48 All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, teshuvah ·completely returned· home beating their breasts.
LUK 23:49 All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee [District, Circuit], stood at a distance, watching these things.
LUK 23:50 Behold, a man named Joseph [May he add], who was a member of the council, a good and upright man
LUK 23:51 (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews [Praisers], who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom:
LUK 23:52 this man went to Pilate [Armed with javelin], and asked for Yeshua's [Salvation]'s body.
LUK 23:53 He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
LUK 23:54 It was the Preparation Day (Nissan 14), and the festival Sabbath ·To cease· was drawing near.
LUK 23:55 The women, who had come with him out of Galilee [District, Circuit], followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
LUK 23:56 They teshuvah ·completely returned·, and prepared spices and ointments. On the double Shabbatot ·To cease· (Nissan 15 and 16) they rested according to the commandment.
LUK 24:1 But at early morning dawn on the first day of the week (Nissan 17, the day of First Fruits #1), they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
LUK 24:2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
LUK 24:3 They entered in, and didn’t find the Master Yeshua's [Salvation]'s body.
LUK 24:4 While they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
LUK 24:5 Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
LUK 24:6 He is not here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee [District, Circuit],
LUK 24:7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners devoted to sin ·miss the marks and be without share in the goal (and stained by definite crime vice)·, and be executed on the stake, and the third day rise again?”
LUK 24:8 They remembered his words,
LUK 24:9 teshuvah ·completely returned· from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
LUK 24:10 Now they were Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower], Joanna, and Mary [Rebellion] the mother of James [Surplanter]. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.
LUK 24:11 These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t trust them.
LUK 24:12 But Peter [Rock] got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
LUK 24:13 Behold, two of them were going that same day (Nissan 17) to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia [7.93 mi; 11.1 km] from Jerusalem [City of peace].
LUK 24:14 They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.
LUK 24:15 While they talked and questioned together, Yeshua [Salvation] himself came near, and went with them.
LUK 24:16 But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
LUK 24:17 He said to them, “What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?”
LUK 24:18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem [City of peace] who does not know the things which have happened there in these days?”
LUK 24:19 He said to them, “What things?” They said to him, “The things concerning Yeshua [Salvation], the Nazarene [person from Branch, Separated one], who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
LUK 24:20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and nailed him to the stake.
LUK 24:21 But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel [God prevails]. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
LUK 24:22 Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;
LUK 24:23 and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
LUK 24:24 Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”
LUK 24:25 He said to them, “Foolish men, and slow of heart to trust in all that the prophets have spoken!
LUK 24:26 Didn’t the Messiah [Anointed one] have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”
LUK 24:27 Beginning from Moses [Drawn out] and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
LUK 24:28 They came near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.
LUK 24:29 They urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over. (Finish of Nissan 17, nearing to the start of Nissan 18.)” He went in to stay with them.
LUK 24:30 When he had sat down at the table with them, he took the matzah ·unleavened bread· and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them.
LUK 24:31 Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.
LUK 24:32 They said to one another, “Did not our hearts burn within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?”
LUK 24:33 They rose up that very hour, teshuvah ·completely returned· to Jerusalem [City of peace], and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
LUK 24:34 saying, “The Master is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simeon [Hearing]!”
LUK 24:35 They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the matzah ·unleavened bread·.
LUK 24:36 As they said these things, Yeshua [Salvation] himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace be to you; Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], do not be afraid.”
LUK 24:37 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
LUK 24:38 He said to them, “Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?
LUK 24:39 See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”
LUK 24:40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
LUK 24:41 While they still didn’t trust for joy, and wondered, he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”
LUK 24:42 They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
LUK 24:43 He took them, and ate in front of them.
LUK 24:44 He said to them, “This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the Torah ·Teaching· of Moses [Drawn out], the Prophets, and the Psalms [Praises], concerning me must be fulfilled.”
LUK 24:45 Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.
LUK 24:46 He said to them, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Messiah [Anointed one] to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
LUK 24:47 and in his name teshuvah ·complete repentance· and remission of abstract sins ·miss the marks· should be preached to all the nations, starting with Jerusalem [City of peace].
LUK 24:48 You are witnesses of these things.
LUK 24:49 Behold, I send out the promise of 'Avi ·my Father· on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem [City of peace] until you are clothed with power from on high.”
LUK 24:50 He led them out as far as Bethany [House of affliction], and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
LUK 24:51 While he blessed them, he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.
LUK 24:52 They worshiped him, and teshuvah ·completely returned· to Jerusalem [City of peace] with great joy,
LUK 24:53 and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen ·So be it·.
JOH 1:1 B'resheet ·In the beginning of the beginning· was ha D'var ·the Word·, and ha D'var ·the Word· was with God, and ha D'var ·the Word· was God.
JOH 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.
JOH 1:3 All things came to be through him and without him nothing made had being.
JOH 1:4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
JOH 1:5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
JOH 1:6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John [Yah is gracious].
JOH 1:7 The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might trust through him.
JOH 1:8 He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.
JOH 1:9 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
JOH 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.
JOH 1:11 He came to his own, and those who were his own didn’t receive him.
JOH 1:12 But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who trust in his name:
JOH 1:13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
JOH 1:14 Ha D'var ·The Word· became flesh, and tabernacled among us. We saw his shekhinah ·manifest weighty glory and presence of God·, such shekhinah ·manifest weighty glory and presence of God· as of the one and only Son of the Abba ·Father·, full of grace and truth.
JOH 1:15 John [Yah is gracious] testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’”
JOH 1:16 From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.
JOH 1:17 For the Torah ·Teaching· was given through Moses [Drawn out]; grace and truth came through Yeshua Messiah [Salvation Anointed one].
JOH 1:18 No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, he has declared him.
JOH 1:19 This is John [Yah is gracious]’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites [Descendants of United with] from Jerusalem [City of peace] to ask him, “Who are you?”
JOH 1:20 He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Messiah [Anointed one].”
JOH 1:21 They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah [My God Yah]?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet (promised Messiah)?” He answered, “No.”
JOH 1:22 They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
JOH 1:23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of MarYah [Master Yahweh],’ as Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet said.”
JOH 1:24 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees [Separated].
JOH 1:25 They asked him, “Why then do you mikvah ·baptise·, if you are not the Messiah [Anointed one], nor Elijah [My God Yah], nor the prophet (promised Messiah)?”
JOH 1:26 John [Yah is gracious] answered them, “I mikvah ·baptise· in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know.
JOH 1:27 He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.”
JOH 1:28 These things were done in Bethany [House of affliction] beyond the Jordan [Descender], where John [Yah is gracious] was baptizing.
JOH 1:29 The next day, he saw Yeshua [Salvation] coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the abstract sin ·miss the mark· of the world!
JOH 1:30 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.’
JOH 1:31 I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel [God prevails].”
JOH 1:32 John [Yah is gracious] testified, saying, “I have seen haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.
JOH 1:33 I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to mikvah ·baptise· in water, he said to me, ‘On whomever you will see haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who does mikvah ·baptise· in Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness].’
JOH 1:34 I have seen, and have testified that this is the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.”
JOH 1:35 Again, the next day, John [Yah is gracious] was standing with two of his disciples,
JOH 1:36 and he looked at Yeshua [Salvation] as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”
JOH 1:37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Yeshua [Salvation].
JOH 1:38 Yeshua [Salvation] turned, and saw them following, and said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi!” (Which is to say, being interpreted, ·Teacher·). “Where are you staying?”
JOH 1:39 He said to them, “Come, and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon.
JOH 1:40 One of the two who heard John [Yah is gracious], and followed him, was Andrew [Manly], Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock]’s brother.
JOH 1:41 He first found his own brother, Simeon [Hearing], and said to him, “We have found the Messiah [Anointed one]!” (which is, being interpreted, Moshiach ·Anointed one·).
JOH 1:42 He brought him to Yeshua [Salvation]. Yeshua [Salvation] looked at him, and said, “You are Simeon [Hearing] the son of Jonah [Dove]. You shall be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter [Rock]).
JOH 1:43 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee [District, Circuit], and he found Philip [Loves horses]. Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Follow me.”
JOH 1:44 Now Philip [Loves horses] was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew [Manly] and Peter [Rock].
JOH 1:45 Philip [Loves horses] found Nathanael [Given by God], and said to him, “We have found the one that Moses [Drawn out] wrote about in the Torah ·Teaching·, and the Prophets— it is Yeshua [Salvation] son of Joseph [May he add] from Nazareth [Branch, Separated one].”
JOH 1:46 Nathanael [Given by God] said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one]?” Philip [Loves horses] said to him, “Come and see.”
JOH 1:47 Yeshua [Salvation] saw Nathanael [Given by God] coming to him, and said about him, “Behold, an Israelite [Descendant of God prevails] indeed, in whom is no deceit!”
JOH 1:48 Nathanael [Given by God] said to him, “How do you know me?” Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Before Philip [Loves horses] called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”
JOH 1:49 Nathanael [Given by God] answered him, “ Rabbi ·Teacher·, you are the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·! You are Melek Isra'el [King of God prevails]!”
JOH 1:50 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you trust? You will see greater things than these!”
JOH 1:51 He said to him, “Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”
JOH 2:1 The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee [District, Circuit]. Yeshua's [Salvation]'s mother was there.
JOH 2:2 Yeshua [Salvation] also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.
JOH 2:3 When the wine ran out, Yeshua's [Salvation]'s mother said to him, “They have no wine.”
JOH 2:4 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.”
JOH 2:5 His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.”
JOH 2:6 Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Judean [Person from Praise] way of purifying, containing two to three metretes [20 to 30 gal; 37.85 to 75.7 L] for each pot, [a total of 1,200 to 1,800 gal; 188.7 to 315 L].
JOH 2:7 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” They filled them up to the brim.
JOH 2:8 He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.” So they took it.
JOH 2:9 When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
JOH 2:10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!”
JOH 2:11 This beginning of his signs Yeshua [Salvation] did in Cana of Galilee [District, Circuit], and revealed his glory; and his disciples trusted in him.
JOH 2:12 After this, he went down to Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
JOH 2:13 The Pesac ·Passover· in Judah [Praised] was at hand, and Yeshua [Salvation] went up to Jerusalem [City of peace].
JOH 2:14 He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
JOH 2:15 He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables.
JOH 2:16 To those who sold the doves, he said, “Take these things out of here! Don’t make 'Avi ·my Father·’s house a marketplace!”
JOH 2:17 (His disciples later remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”)
JOH 2:18 The Jews [Praisers] therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?”
JOH 2:19 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
JOH 2:20 The Jews [Praisers] therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?”
JOH 2:21 But he spoke of the temple of his body.
JOH 2:22 When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they trusted the Scripture, and the word which Yeshua [Salvation] had said.
JOH 2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem [City of peace] at the Pesac ·Passover·, during the feast, many trusted in his name, observing his signs which he did.
JOH 2:24 But Yeshua [Salvation] didn’t trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,
JOH 2:25 and because he didn’t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
JOH 3:1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees [Separated] named Nicodemus [Victory people], a ruler of the Jews [Praisers].
JOH 3:2 The same came to him by night, and said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”
JOH 3:3 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can’t see God’s Kingdom.”
JOH 3:4 Nicodemus [Victory people] said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?”
JOH 3:5 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom.
JOH 3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] is spirit.
JOH 3:7 Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’
JOH 3:8 The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of haRuach [the Spirit, Breath].”
JOH 3:9 Nicodemus [Victory people] answered him, “How can these things be?”
JOH 3:10 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel [God prevails], and don’t understand these things?
JOH 3:11 Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness.
JOH 3:12 If I told you earthly things and you don’t trust, how will you trust if I tell you heavenly things?
JOH 3:13 No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.
JOH 3:14 As Moses [Drawn out] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
JOH 3:15 that whoever trusts in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
JOH 3:16 For God has agapao ·total devotion love· to the inhabitants of the earth, so he gave his one and only Son, that whoever trusts in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
JOH 3:17 For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.
JOH 3:18 He who trusts in him is not judged. He who does not trust has been judged already, because he has not trusted in the name of the one and only Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.
JOH 3:19 This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men have agapao ·total devotion love· to the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.
JOH 3:20 For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.
JOH 3:21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.”
JOH 3:22 After these things, Yeshua [Salvation] came with his disciples into the land of Judea [Praise]. He stayed there with them, and immersed.
JOH 3:23 John [Yah is gracious] also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were immersed.
JOH 3:24 For John [Yah is gracious] was not yet thrown into prison.
JOH 3:25 There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John [Yah is gracious]’s disciples with some Jews [Praisers] about purification.
JOH 3:26 They came to John [Yah is gracious], and said to him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, he who was with you beyond the Jordan [Descender], to whom you have testified, behold, the same does mikvah ·baptism·, and everyone is coming to him.”
JOH 3:27 John [Yah is gracious] answered, “A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.
JOH 3:28 You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah [Anointed one],’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’
JOH 3:29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.
JOH 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
JOH 3:31 He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
JOH 3:32 What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.
JOH 3:33 He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
JOH 3:34 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] without measure.
JOH 3:35 Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· has agapao ·total devotion love· to the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
JOH 3:36 One who trusts in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”
JOH 4:1 Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees [Separated] had heard that Yeshua [Salvation] was making and baptizing more disciples than John [Yah is gracious]
JOH 4:2 (although Yeshua [Salvation] himself didn’t mikvah ·baptise·, but his disciples),
JOH 4:3 he left Judea [Praise], and departed into Galilee [District, Circuit].
JOH 4:4 He needed to pass through Samaria [Watch-mountain].
JOH 4:5 So he came to a city of Samaria [Watch-mountain], called Sychar [Shoulder], near the parcel of ground that Jacob [Supplanter] gave to his son, Joseph [May he add].
JOH 4:6 Jacob [Supplanter]’s well was there. Yeshua [Salvation] therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.
JOH 4:7 A woman of Samaria [Watch-mountain] came to draw water. Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Give me a drink.”
JOH 4:8 For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
JOH 4:9 The Samaritan [person from Watch-mountain] woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew [Praiser], ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan [person from Watch-mountain] woman?” (For Jews [Praisers] have no dealings with Samaritans [people from Watch-mountain].)
JOH 4:10 Yeshua [Salvation] answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
JOH 4:11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?
JOH 4:12 Are you greater than Avinu ·our Father·, Jacob [Supplanter], who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?”
JOH 4:13 Yeshua [Salvation] answered her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
JOH 4:14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”
JOH 4:15 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.”
JOH 4:16 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”
JOH 4:17 The woman answered, “I have no husband.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “You said well, ‘I have no husband,’
JOH 4:18 for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.”
JOH 4:19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
JOH 4:20 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews [Praisers] say that in Jerusalem [City of peace] is the place where people ought to worship.”
JOH 4:21 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Woman, trust me, the time will come, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem [City of peace], will you worship Abba Father.
JOH 4:22 You worship that which you don’t know. We worship that which we know; for yishu'ah ·salvation· is from the Jews [Praisers].
JOH 4:23 But the time will come, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship Abba Father in spirit and truth, for Abba Father seeks such to be his worshipers.
JOH 4:24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”
JOH 4:25 The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah [Anointed one] comes, he who is called Messiah [Anointed one]. When he has come, he will declare to us all things.”
JOH 4:26 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], I who is speaking to you.”
JOH 4:27 At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?”
JOH 4:28 So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,
JOH 4:29 “Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Messiah [Anointed one]?”
JOH 4:30 They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
JOH 4:31 In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, eat.”
JOH 4:32 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”
JOH 4:33 The disciples therefore said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”
JOH 4:34 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.
JOH 4:35 Don’t you say, ‘There are yet four months until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.
JOH 4:36 He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
JOH 4:37 For in this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’
JOH 4:38 I sent you to reap that for which you haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”
JOH 4:39 From that city many of the Samaritans [people from Watch-mountain] trusted in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I did.”
JOH 4:40 So when the Samaritans [people from Watch-mountain] came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.
JOH 4:41 Many more trusted because of his word.
JOH 4:42 They said to the woman, “Now we trust, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Messiah [Anointed one], the Savior of the world.”
JOH 4:43 After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee [District, Circuit].
JOH 4:44 For Yeshua [Salvation] himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
JOH 4:45 So when he came into Galilee [District, Circuit], the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem [City of peace] at the feast, for they also went to the feast.
JOH 4:46 Yeshua [Salvation] came therefore again to Cana of Galilee [District, Circuit], where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion].
JOH 4:47 When he heard that Yeshua [Salvation] had come out of Judea [Praise] into Galilee [District, Circuit], he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
JOH 4:48 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way trust.”
JOH 4:49 The nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”
JOH 4:50 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Go your way. Your son lives.” The man trusted the word that Yeshua [Salvation] spoke to him, and he went his way.
JOH 4:51 As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!”
JOH 4:52 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon, the fever left him.”
JOH 4:53 So the Abba Father knew that it was at that hour in which Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Your son lives.” He trusted, as did his whole house.
JOH 4:54 This is again the second sign that Yeshua [Salvation] did, having come out of Judea [Praise] into Galilee [District, Circuit].
JOH 5:1 After these things, there was a Judean [Person from Praise] festival, and Yeshua [Salvation] went up to Jerusalem [City of peace].
JOH 5:2 Now in Jerusalem [City of peace] by the sheep gate, there is a pool with five pourches, which is called in Hebrew [Immigrant], “Bethesda [House of mercy]”.
JOH 5:3 In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;
JOH 5:4 for an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.
JOH 5:5 A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
JOH 5:6 When Yeshua [Salvation] saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be made well?”
JOH 5:7 The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”
JOH 5:8 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”
JOH 5:9 Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath ·To cease· on that day.
JOH 5:10 So the Jews [Praisers] said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath ·To cease·! It is against Torah ·Teaching· for you to carry your mat!”
JOH 5:11 He answered them, “He who made me well, the same said to me, ‘Take up your mat, and walk.’”
JOH 5:12 Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your mat, and walk’?”
JOH 5:13 But he who was healed didn’t know who it was, for Yeshua [Salvation] had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
JOH 5:14 Afterward Yeshua [Salvation] found him in the temple, and said to him, “Behold, you are made well. Commit sin ·miss the mark and be without share· no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”
JOH 5:15 The man went away, and told the Jews [Praisers] that it was Yeshua [Salvation] who had made him well.
JOH 5:16 For this cause the Jews [Praisers] persecuted Yeshua [Salvation], and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath ·To cease·.
JOH 5:17 But Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “ 'Avi [My Father] is still working, so I am working, too.”
JOH 5:18 For this cause therefore the Jews [Praisers] sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath ·To cease·, but also called God 'Aviv ·his Father·, making himself equal with God.
JOH 5:19 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore answered them, “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees Abba ·Father· doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.
JOH 5:20 For Abba ·Father· has phileo ·affectionate love, high regard· for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
JOH 5:21 For as Abba ·Father· raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.
JOH 5:22 For the Abba ·Father· judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,
JOH 5:23 that all may honor the Son, even as they honor haAbba ·the Father·. He who does not honor the Son does not honor haAbba ·the Father· who sent him.
JOH 5:24 “Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and trusts him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
JOH 5:25 Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·’s voice; and those who hear will live.
JOH 5:26 For as Abba Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.
JOH 5:27 He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.
JOH 5:28 Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
JOH 5:29 and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
JOH 5:30 I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is upright; because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of 'Avi ·my Father· who sent me.
JOH 5:31 “If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.
JOH 5:32 It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.
JOH 5:33 You have sent to John [Yah is gracious], and he has testified to the truth.
JOH 5:34 But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
JOH 5:35 He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
JOH 5:36 But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John [Yah is gracious], for the works which Abba Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Abba ·Father· has sent me.
JOH 5:37 Abba ·Father· himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
JOH 5:38 You don’t have his word living in you; because you don’t trust him whom he sent.
JOH 5:39 “You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.
JOH 5:40 Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.
JOH 5:41 I don’t receive glory from men.
JOH 5:42 But I know you, that you don’t have God’s agape ·unconditional love· in yourselves.
JOH 5:43 I have come in 'Avi ·my Father·’s name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
JOH 5:44 How can you trust, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the glory that comes from the only God?
JOH 5:45 “Don’t think that I will accuse you to Abba Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses [Drawn out], on whom you have set your hope.
JOH 5:46 For if you trusted Moses [Drawn out], you would trust me; for he wrote about me.
JOH 5:47 But if you don’t trust his writings, how will you trust my words?”
JOH 6:1 After these things, Yeshua [Salvation] went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee [District, Circuit], which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
JOH 6:2 A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.
JOH 6:3 Yeshua [Salvation] went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.
JOH 6:4 Now the Judean [Person from Praise] festival of Pesac ·Passover· was at hand.
JOH 6:5 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip [Loves horses], “Where are we to buy matzah ·unleavened bread·, that these may eat?”
JOH 6:6 This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
JOH 6:7 Philip [Loves horses] answered him, “Two hundred denarii (200 days wages) worth of matzah ·unleavened bread· is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little.”
JOH 6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew [Manly], Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock]’s brother, said to him,
JOH 6:9 “There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?”
JOH 6:10 Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Have the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
JOH 6:11 Yeshua [Salvation] took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
JOH 6:12 When they were filled, he said to his disciples, “Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.”
JOH 6:13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
JOH 6:14 When therefore the people saw the sign which Yeshua [Salvation] did, they said, “This is truly the prophet (promised Messiah) who comes into the world.”
JOH 6:15 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
JOH 6:16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
JOH 6:17 and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion]. It was now dark, and Yeshua [Salvation] had not come to them.
JOH 6:18 The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.
JOH 6:19 When therefore they had rowed between twenty-five stadia [3.3 mi; 4.6 km] to thirty stadia [4 mi; 5.6 km] distance, they saw Yeshua [Salvation] walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.
JOH 6:20 But he said to them, “Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], don’t be afraid.”
JOH 6:21 They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
JOH 6:22 On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Yeshua [Salvation] hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.
JOH 6:23 However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
JOH 6:24 When the multitude therefore saw that Yeshua [Salvation] was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion], seeking Yeshua [Salvation].
JOH 6:25 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, when did you come here?”
JOH 6:26 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.
JOH 6:27 Don’t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Abba Father has sealed him.”
JOH 6:28 They said therefore to him, “What must we do, that we may work the works of God?”
JOH 6:29 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “This is the work of God, that you trust in him whom he has sent.”
JOH 6:30 They said therefore to him, “What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and trust you? What work do you do?
JOH 6:31 Our fathers ate the manna ·what is it· in the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.’”
JOH 6:32 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them, “Most certainly, I tell you, it was not Moses [Drawn out] who gave you the manna ·what is it· out of heaven, but 'Avi ·my Father· gives you the true manna ·what is it· out of heaven.
JOH 6:33 For the manna of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.”
JOH 6:34 They said therefore to him, “Lord, always give us this manna.”
JOH 6:35 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty.
JOH 6:36 But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don’t trust.
JOH 6:37 All those whom Abba ·Father· gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
JOH 6:38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
JOH 6:39 This is the will of 'Avi ·my Father· who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.
JOH 6:40 This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and trusts in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”
JOH 6:41 The Jews [Praisers] therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, “I am the bread which came down out of heaven.”
JOH 6:42 They said, “Is not this Yeshua [Salvation], the son of Joseph [May he add], whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, ‘I have come down out of heaven?’”
JOH 6:43 Therefore Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Don’t murmur among yourselves.
JOH 6:44 No one can come to me unless Abba Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
JOH 6:45 It is written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by Adonai .’ Therefore everyone who hears from haAbba ·the Father·, and has learned, comes to me.
JOH 6:46 Not that anyone has seen Abba Father, except he who is from God. He has seen Abba Father.
JOH 6:47 Most certainly, I tell you, he who trusts in me has eternal life.
JOH 6:48 Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], the bread of life.
JOH 6:49 Your fathers ate the manna ·what is it· in the wilderness, and they died.
JOH 6:50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.
JOH 6:51 Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], the living manna ·what is it· which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this manna, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”
JOH 6:52 The Jews [Praisers] therefore contended with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
JOH 6:53 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them, “Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have life in yourselves.
JOH 6:54 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
JOH 6:55 For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
JOH 6:56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.
JOH 6:57 As the living Abba Father sent me, and I live because of Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.
JOH 6:58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven— not as our fathers ate the manna ·what is it·, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”
JOH 6:59 He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum [Village-Comfort, Village-Compassion].
JOH 6:60 Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?”
JOH 6:61 But Yeshua [Salvation] knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, “Does this cause you to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·?
JOH 6:62 Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
JOH 6:63 It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
JOH 6:64 But there are some of you who don’t trust.” For Yeshua [Salvation] knew from the beginning who they were who didn’t trust, and who it was who would betray him.
JOH 6:65 He said, “For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by 'Avi ·my Father·.”
JOH 6:66 At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
JOH 6:67 Yeshua [Salvation] said therefore to the twelve, “You don’t also want to go away, do you?”
JOH 6:68 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
JOH 6:69 We have come to trust and know that you are the Messiah [Anointed one], haBen haElohim Chayim [the Son of the God Living].”
JOH 6:70 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil [Accuser]?”
JOH 6:71 Now he spoke of Judas [Praised], the son of Simeon [Hearing] from K'riot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.
JOH 7:1 After these things, Yeshua [Salvation] was walking in Galilee [District, Circuit], for he would not walk in Judea [Praise], because the Jews [Praisers] sought to kill him.
JOH 7:2 Now the festival of Sukkot ·Tabernacles·, the Festival of Booths, was at hand. (The seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· 15th day).
JOH 7:3 His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea [Praise], that your disciples also may see your works which you do.
JOH 7:4 For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”
JOH 7:5 For even his brothers didn’t trust in him.
JOH 7:6 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
JOH 7:7 The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.
JOH 7:8 You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”
JOH 7:9 Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee [District, Circuit].
JOH 7:10 But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
JOH 7:11 The Jews [Praisers] therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”
JOH 7:12 There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”
JOH 7:13 Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews [Praisers].
JOH 7:14 But when it was now the middle of the feast, Yeshua [Salvation] went up into the temple and taught.
JOH 7:15 The Jews [Praisers] therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know so much, without having studied?”
JOH 7:16 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
JOH 7:17 If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.
JOH 7:18 He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no sinfulness ·legal injustice that misses the mark and is without share in the goal· is in him.
JOH 7:19 Didn’t Moses [Drawn out] give you the Torah ·Teaching·? Yet none of you keeps Torah ·Teaching·! Why do you seek to kill me?”
JOH 7:20 The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”
JOH 7:21 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
JOH 7:22 Moses [Drawn out] has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses [Drawn out], but of the Patriarchs), and on the Sabbath ·To cease· you circumcise a boy.
JOH 7:23 If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath ·To cease·, that the Torah ·Teaching· of Moses [Drawn out] may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ·To cease·?
JOH 7:24 Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge upright judgment.”
JOH 7:25 Therefore some of them of Jerusalem [City of peace] said, “Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
JOH 7:26 Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Messiah [Anointed one]?
JOH 7:27 However we know where this man comes from, but when the Messiah [Anointed one] comes, no one will know where he comes from.”
JOH 7:28 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know.
JOH 7:29 I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”
JOH 7:30 They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
JOH 7:31 But of the multitude, many trusted in him. They said, “When the Messiah [Anointed one] comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”
JOH 7:32 The Pharisees [Separated] heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees [Separated] sent officers to arrest him.
JOH 7:33 Then Yeshua [Salvation] said, “I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.
JOH 7:34 You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come.”
JOH 7:35 The Jews [Praisers] therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
JOH 7:36 What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come’?”
JOH 7:37 Now on the last day of the festival (of Tabernacles, the seventh day called Hoshana Rabbah ·Save now Great·, the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· 21st day)), Yeshua [Salvation] stood and cried out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
JOH 7:38 Whoever puts his trust in me, as the Scripture says, rivers of living water will flow from his inmost being!”
JOH 7:39 But he said this about the Ruach ·Spirit, Breath·, which those trusting in him were to receive. For the Holy Ruach ·Spirit, Breath· was not yet given, because Yeshua [Salvation] was not yet glorified.
JOH 7:40 Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”
JOH 7:41 Others said, “This is the Messiah [Anointed one].” But some said, “What, does the Messiah [Anointed one] come out of Galilee [District, Circuit]?
JOH 7:42 Has not the Scripture said that the Messiah [Anointed one] comes of the offspring of David [Beloved], and from Bethlehem [House of Bread], the village where David [Beloved] lived?”
JOH 7:43 So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
JOH 7:44 Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.
JOH 7:45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees [Separated], and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?”
JOH 7:46 The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”
JOH 7:47 The Pharisees [Separated] therefore answered them, “You are not also led astray, are you?
JOH 7:48 Have any of the rulers trusted in him, or of the Pharisees [Separated]?
JOH 7:49 True, these 'am-ha'aretz ·people of the land· do, but they know nothing about the Torah ·Teaching·, they are under a curse!”
JOH 7:50 Nicodemus [Victory people] (he who came to him by night, being one of the Pharisees [Separated]) said to them,
JOH 7:51 “Our Torah ·Teaching· does not condemn a man, does it, until after hearing from him personally and finding out what he’s doing?”
JOH 7:52 They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee [District, Circuit]? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee [District, Circuit].”
JOH 7:53 Everyone went to his own house.
JOH 8:1 But Yeshua [Salvation] went to the Mount of Olives.
JOH 8:2 Now very early in the morning (of the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· 22nd day)), he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and taught them. (This day is called Sh'mini Atrzeret ·Eighth day Assembly·.)
JOH 8:3 The Torah-Teachers and the Pharisees [Separated] brought a woman taken in moicheia ·adultery· and set her in the midst of Yeshua [Salvation].
JOH 8:4 They told him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, we found this woman moicheuo ·committing adultery·, in the very act.
JOH 8:5 Now in our Torah ·Teaching·, Moses [Drawn out] enjoined us that such a woman be stoned to death. What then do you say about her?”
JOH 8:6 They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. But Yeshua [Salvation] stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
JOH 8:7 But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, “He who is set apart from sin ·devoted to making the mark and taking share in the goal· among you, let him throw the first stone at her.”
JOH 8:8 Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
JOH 8:9 They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Yeshua [Salvation] was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.
JOH 8:10 Yeshua [Salvation], standing up, saw her and said, “Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?”
JOH 8:11 She said, “No one, Lord.” Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin ·miss the mark and be without share· no more.”
JOH 8:12 Again, therefore, Yeshua [Salvation] spoke to them, saying, “ Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”
JOH 8:13 The Pharisees [Separated] therefore said to him, “You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”
JOH 8:14 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don’t know where I came from, or where I am going.
JOH 8:15 You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.
JOH 8:16 Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· who sent me.
JOH 8:17 It’s also written in your Torah ·Teaching· that the testimony of two people is valid.
JOH 8:18 Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] that testifies about myself, and Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· who sent me testifies about me.”
JOH 8:19 They said therefore to him, “Where is your Abba Father?” Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “You know neither me, nor 'Avi ·my Father·. If you knew me, you would know 'Avi ·my Father· also.”
JOH 8:20 Yeshua [Salvation] spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
JOH 8:21 Yeshua [Salvation] said therefore again to them, “I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your abstract sins ·miss the marks·. Where I go, you can’t come.”
JOH 8:22 The Jews [Praisers] therefore said, “Will he kill himself, that he says, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come’?”
JOH 8:23 He said to them, “You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.
JOH 8:24 I said therefore to you that you will die in your abstract sins ·miss the marks·; for unless you trust that Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], you will die in your abstract sins ·miss the marks·.”
JOH 8:25 They said therefore to him, “Who are you?” Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
JOH 8:26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world.”
JOH 8:27 They didn’t understand that he spoke to them about haAbba ·the Father·.
JOH 8:28 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)], and I do nothing of myself, but as 'Avi ·my Father· taught me, I say these things.
JOH 8:29 He who sent me is with me. Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.”
JOH 8:30 As he spoke these things, many trusted in him.
JOH 8:31 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to those Jews [Praisers] who had trusted him, “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.
JOH 8:32 You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”
JOH 8:33 They answered him, “We are Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s offspring, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, ‘You will be made free’?”
JOH 8:34 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits abstract sin ·miss the mark· is the bond-servant of abstract sin ·miss the mark·.
JOH 8:35 A bond-servant does not live in the house forever. A son remains forever.
JOH 8:36 If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
JOH 8:37 I know that you are Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
JOH 8:38 I say the things which I have seen with 'Avi ·my Father·; and you also do the things which you have seen with 'Avikah ·your Father·.”
JOH 8:39 They answered him, “Abraham [Father of a multitude] is Avinu ·our Father·.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “If you were Abraham [Father of a multitude]’s children, you would do the works of Abraham [Father of a multitude].
JOH 8:40 But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham [Father of a multitude] didn’t do this.
JOH 8:41 You do the works of your Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·.” They said to him, “We were not born of porhneia ·sexual immorality·; we have one Abba Father, God.”
JOH 8:42 Therefore Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “If God were your Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, you would have agapao ·total devotion love· towards me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but he sent me.
JOH 8:43 Why don’t you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word.
JOH 8:44 You are of your Abba father, the devil [Accuser], and you want to do the epithumia ·lusts, desires· of 'Avikah ·your Father·. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·.
JOH 8:45 But because I tell the truth, you don’t trust me.
JOH 8:46 Which of you convicts me of abstract sin ·miss the mark·? If I tell the truth, why do you not trust me?
JOH 8:47 He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.”
JOH 8:48 Then the Jews [Praisers] answered him, “Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan [person from Watch-mountain], and have a demon?”
JOH 8:49 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “I don’t have a demon, but I honor 'Avi ·my Father·, and you dishonor me.
JOH 8:50 But I don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.
JOH 8:51 Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.”
JOH 8:52 Then the Jews [Praisers] said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham [Father of a multitude] died, and the prophets; and you say, ‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’
JOH 8:53 Are you greater than Abraham [Father of a multitude] Avinu ·our Father·, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”
JOH 8:54 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is 'Avi ·my Father· who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.
JOH 8:55 You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.
JOH 8:56 'Avikah ·your Father· Abraham [Father of a multitude] rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.”
JOH 8:57 The Jews [Praisers] therefore said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham [Father of a multitude]?”
JOH 8:58 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham [Father of a multitude] came into existence, Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)].”
JOH 8:59 Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Yeshua [Salvation] was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.
JOH 9:1 As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
JOH 9:2 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, who committed sin ·missed the mark and being without share·, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” (Still the seventh month Ethanim ·Ever-flowing durable stream (in Hebrew), 7· or Tishrei ·[Beginning (in Babylonian)]· 22 day)).
JOH 9:3 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Neither did this man nor his parents commit sin ·miss the mark and be without share·; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.
JOH 9:4 I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
JOH 9:5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
JOH 9:6 When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,
JOH 9:7 and said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.
JOH 9:8 The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Is not this he who sat and begged?”
JOH 9:9 Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.” He said, “I am he.”
JOH 9:10 They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”
JOH 9:11 He answered, “A man called Yeshua [Salvation] made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam [Sent], and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”
JOH 9:12 Then they asked him, “Where is he?” He said, “I don’t know.”
JOH 9:13 They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees [Separated].
JOH 9:14 It was a Sabbath ·To cease· when Yeshua [Salvation] made the mud and opened his eyes.
JOH 9:15 Again therefore the Pharisees [Separated] also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
JOH 9:16 Some therefore of the Pharisees [Separated] said, “This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath ·To cease·.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal· do such signs?” There was division among them.
JOH 9:17 Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”
JOH 9:18 The Jews [Praisers] therefore did not trust concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
JOH 9:19 and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
JOH 9:20 His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
JOH 9:21 but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”
JOH 9:22 His parents said these things because they feared the Jews [Praisers]; for the Jews [Praisers] had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Messiah [Anointed one], he would be put out of the synagogue.
JOH 9:23 Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”
JOH 9:24 So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·.”
JOH 9:25 He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”
JOH 9:26 They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
JOH 9:27 He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”
JOH 9:28 They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses [Drawn out].
JOH 9:29 We know that God has spoken to Moses [Drawn out]. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”
JOH 9:30 The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
JOH 9:31 We know that God does not listen to sinners ·devoted to missing the mark and without share in the goal·, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.
JOH 9:32 Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
JOH 9:33 If this man was not from God, he could do nothing.”
JOH 9:34 They answered him, “You were altogether born in abstract sins ·miss the marks·, and do you teach us?” They threw him out.
JOH 9:35 Yeshua [Salvation] heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you trust in the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·?”
JOH 9:36 He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may trust in him?”
JOH 9:37 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”
JOH 9:38 He said, “Lord, I trust!” and he worshiped him.
JOH 9:39 Yeshua [Salvation] said, “I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”
JOH 9:40 Those of the Pharisees [Separated] who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”
JOH 9:41 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no abstract sin ·miss the mark·; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your abstract sin ·miss the mark· remains.
JOH 10:1 “Most certainly, I tell you, one who does not enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
JOH 10:2 But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
JOH 10:3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
JOH 10:4 Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
JOH 10:5 They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don’t know the voice of strangers.”
JOH 10:6 Yeshua [Salvation] spoke this parable to them, but they didn’t understand what he was telling them.
JOH 10:7 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them again, “Most certainly, I tell you, Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the sheep’s door.
JOH 10:8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them.
JOH 10:9 Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
JOH 10:10 The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
JOH 10:11 Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
JOH 10:12 He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
JOH 10:13 The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and does not care for the sheep.
JOH 10:14 Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own;
JOH 10:15 even as Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· knows me, and I know Abba Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
JOH 10:16 I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.
JOH 10:17 For this reason haAbba ·the Father· has agapao ·total devotion love· unto me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it again.
JOH 10:18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from 'Avi ·my Father·.”
JOH 10:19 Therefore a division arose again among the Jews [Praisers] because of these words.
JOH 10:20 Many of them said, “He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?”
JOH 10:21 Others said, “These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It is not possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?”
JOH 10:22 Then came the Festival of Chanukah ·Dedication· at Jerusalem [City of peace]. (This occurs in the ninth month Kislev ·Trust security / Folly, 9· 25th day to tenth month Tevet ·Ten (in Hebrew) / Good (In Aramaic), 10· 2nd day).
JOH 10:23 It was winter, and Yeshua [Salvation] was walking in the temple, in Solomon [Peaceable, Recompense]’s portico (where one can see the four giant menorahs).
JOH 10:24 The Jews [Praisers] therefore came around him and said to him, “How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Messiah [Anointed one], tell us plainly.”
JOH 10:25 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “I told you, and you don’t trust. The works that I do in 'Avi ·my Father·’s name, these testify about me.
JOH 10:26 But you don’t trust, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
JOH 10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
JOH 10:28 I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
JOH 10:29 'Avi [My Father], who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of 'Avi ·my Father·’s hand.
JOH 10:30 I and Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· are one.”
JOH 10:31 Therefore Jews [Praisers] took up stones again to stone him.
JOH 10:32 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “I have shown you many good works from 'Avi ·my Father·. For which of those works do you stone me?”
JOH 10:33 The Jews [Praisers] answered him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God.”
JOH 10:34 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Is not it written in your Torah ·Teaching·, ‘I said, you are elohim ·judges, gods·?’
JOH 10:35 If he called the people 'elohim' ·judges, gods·, to whom the word of Elohim ·God· came (and the Scripture can’t be broken),
JOH 10:36 do you say of him whom haAbba ·the Father· sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·?’
JOH 10:37 If I don’t do the works of 'Avi ·my Father·, don’t trust me.
JOH 10:38 But if I do them, though you don’t trust me, trust the works; that you may know and trust that haAbba ·the Father· is in me, and I in Abba Father.”
JOH 10:39 They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.
JOH 10:40 He went away again beyond the Jordan [Descender] into the place where John [Yah is gracious] was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.
JOH 10:41 Many came to him. They said, “John [Yah is gracious] indeed did no sign, but everything that John [Yah is gracious] said about this man is true.”
JOH 10:42 Many trusted in him there.
JOH 11:1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus [Help of God] from Bethany [House of affliction], of the village of Mary [Rebellion] and her sister, Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness].
JOH 11:2 It was that Mary [Rebellion] who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus [Help of God], was sick.
JOH 11:3 The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, “Lord, behold, he for whom you phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· is sick.”
JOH 11:4 But when Yeshua [Salvation] heard it, he said, “This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.”
JOH 11:5 Now Yeshua [Salvation] had agapao ·total devotion love· towards Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness], and her sister, and Lazarus [Help of God].
JOH 11:6 When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.
JOH 11:7 Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let’s go into Judea [Praise] again.”
JOH 11:8 The disciples told him, “Rabbi ·Teacher·, the Jews [Praisers] were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?”
JOH 11:9 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Are not there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
JOH 11:10 But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”
JOH 11:11 He said these things, and after that, he said to them, “Our friend, Lazarus [Help of God], has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.”
JOH 11:12 The disciples therefore said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
JOH 11:13 Now Yeshua [Salvation] had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
JOH 11:14 So Yeshua [Salvation] said to them plainly then, “Lazarus [Help of God] is dead.
JOH 11:15 I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may trust. Nevertheless, let’s go to him.”
JOH 11:16 Thomas [Seeker of truth] therefore, who is called Didymus [Twin] in Greek, said to his fellow disciples, “Let’s go also, that we may die with him.”
JOH 11:17 So when Yeshua [Salvation] came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
JOH 11:18 Now Bethany [House of affliction] was near Jerusalem [City of peace], about fifteen stadia away [2 mi; 2.8 km].
JOH 11:19 Many of the Jews [Praisers] had joined the women around Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] and Mary [Rebellion], to console them concerning their brother.
JOH 11:20 Then when Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] heard that Yeshua [Salvation] was coming, she went and met him, but Mary [Rebellion] stayed in the house.
JOH 11:21 Therefore Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] said to Yeshua [Salvation], “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.
JOH 11:22 Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.”
JOH 11:23 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”
JOH 11:24 Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
JOH 11:25 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “ Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the resurrection and the life. He who trusts in me will still live, even if he dies.
JOH 11:26 Whoever lives and trusts in me will never die. Do you trust this?”
JOH 11:27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord. I have come to trust that you are the Messiah [Anointed one], God’s Son, he who comes into the world.”
JOH 11:28 When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary [Rebellion], her sister, secretly, saying, “The Rabbi ·Teacher· is here, and is calling you.”
JOH 11:29 When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.
JOH 11:30 Now Yeshua [Salvation] had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] met him.
JOH 11:31 Then the Jews [Praisers] who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary [Rebellion], that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”
JOH 11:32 Therefore when Mary [Rebellion] came to where Yeshua [Salvation] was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”
JOH 11:33 When Yeshua [Salvation] therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews [Praisers] weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
JOH 11:34 and said, “Where have you laid him?” They told him, “Lord, come and see.”
JOH 11:35 Yeshua [Salvation] wept.
JOH 11:36 The Jews [Praisers] therefore said, “See how much phileo ·affectionate love, high regard· he had for him!”
JOH 11:37 Some of them said, “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?”
JOH 11:38 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
JOH 11:39 Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Take away the stone.” Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness], the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”
JOH 11:40 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you trusted, you would see God’s glory?”
JOH 11:41 So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Yeshua [Salvation] lifted up his eyes, and said, “Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, I thank you that you listened to me.
JOH 11:42 I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may trust that you sent me.”
JOH 11:43 When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus [Help of God], come out!”
JOH 11:44 He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Free him, and let him go.”
JOH 11:45 Therefore many of the Jews [Praisers], who came to Mary [Rebellion] and saw what Yeshua [Salvation] did, trusted in him.
JOH 11:46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees [Separated], and told them the things which Yeshua [Salvation] had done.
JOH 11:47 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees [Separated] gathered a council, and said, “What are we doing? For this man does many signs.
JOH 11:48 If we leave him alone like this, everyone will trust in him, and the Romans [People from Town of flowing waters] will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
JOH 11:49 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out], being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all,
JOH 11:50 nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.”
JOH 11:51 Now he didn’t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Yeshua [Salvation] would die for the nation,
JOH 11:52 and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
JOH 11:53 So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.
JOH 11:54 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore walked no more openly among the Jews [Praisers], but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim [Fruit]. He stayed there with his disciples.
JOH 11:55 Now the Judean [Person from Praise] festival of Pesac ·Passover· was at hand, (the start of Nissan). Many went up from the country to Jerusalem [City of peace] before the Pesac ·Passover·, to purify themselves.
JOH 11:56 Then they sought for Yeshua [Salvation] and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, “What do you think— that he is not coming to the feast at all?”
JOH 11:57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees [Separated] had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.
JOH 12:1 Then six days before the Pesac ·Passover· (Nissan 8), Yeshua [Salvation] came to Bethany [House of affliction], where Lazarus [Help of God] was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
JOH 12:2 So they made him a supper there. Martha [Lady mistress, Strong bitterness] served, but Lazarus [Help of God] was one of those who sat at the table with him.
JOH 12:3 Mary [Rebellion], therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Yeshua [Salvation], and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
JOH 12:4 Then Judas Iscariot [Praised Dagger-man], Simeon [Hearing]’s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,
JOH 12:5 “Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii (300 days wages), and given to the poor?”
JOH 12:6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.
JOH 12:7 But Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
JOH 12:8 For you always have the poor with you, but you don’t always have me.”
JOH 12:9 A large crowd therefore of the Jews [Praisers] learned that he was there, and they came, not for Yeshua's [Salvation]'s sake only, but that they might see Lazarus [Help of God] also, whom he had raised from the dead.
JOH 12:10 But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus [Help of God] to death also,
JOH 12:11 because on account of him many of the Jews [Praisers] went away and trusted in Yeshua [Salvation].
JOH 12:12 On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Yeshua [Salvation] was coming to Jerusalem [City of peace],
JOH 12:13 they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, shouting, “ Hosanna! ·Save now!· Blessed is he who comes in the name of MarYah [Master Yahweh], the Melek Isra'el [King of God prevails]!”
JOH 12:14 Yeshua [Salvation], having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,
JOH 12:15 “Don’t be afraid, daughter of Zion [Mountain ridge, Marking]. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”
JOH 12:16 His disciples didn’t understand these things at first, but when Yeshua [Salvation] was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.
JOH 12:17 The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus [Help of God] out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.
JOH 12:18 For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
JOH 12:19 The Pharisees [Separated] therefore said among themselves, “See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.”
JOH 12:20 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.
JOH 12:21 These, therefore, came to Philip [Loves horses], who was from Bethsaida of Galilee [District, Circuit], and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see Yeshua [Salvation].”
JOH 12:22 Philip [Loves horses] came and told Andrew [Manly], and in turn, Andrew [Manly] came with Philip [Loves horses], and they told Yeshua [Salvation].
JOH 12:23 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
JOH 12:24 Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
JOH 12:25 He who phileo ·affectionately loves, has high regard for· his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.
JOH 12:26 If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, haAbba ·the Father· will honor him.
JOH 12:27 “Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? ‘ Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, save me from this time?’ But for this cause I came to this time.
JOH 12:28 Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, glorify your name!” Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, “I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.”
JOH 12:29 The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”
JOH 12:30 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
JOH 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.
JOH 12:32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”
JOH 12:33 But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
JOH 12:34 The multitude answered him, “We have learned from the Torah ·Teaching· that the Messiah [Anointed one] remains forever. How do you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’ Who is this Son of Man?”
JOH 12:35 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them, “Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
JOH 12:36 While you have the light, trust in the light, that you may become children of light.” Yeshua [Salvation] said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.
JOH 12:37 But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn’t trust in him,
JOH 12:38 that the word of Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, “ Adonai, who has trusted our report? To has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?”
JOH 12:39 For this cause they couldn’t trust, for Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] said again,
JOH 12:40 “He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would make teshuvah ·completely return in repentance·, and I would heal them.”
JOH 12:41 Isaiah [Salvation of Yah] said these things when he saw his shekhinah ·manifest weighty glory and presence of God·, and spoke of him.
JOH 12:42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many trusted in him, but because of the Pharisees [Separated] they didn’t confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue,
JOH 12:43 for they had agapao ·total devotion love· for men’s praise more than God’s praise.
JOH 12:44 Yeshua [Salvation] cried out and said, “Whoever trusts in me, trusts not in me, but in him who sent me.
JOH 12:45 He who sees me sees him who sent me.
JOH 12:46 I have come whom as a light into the world, that whoever trusts in me may not remain in the darkness.
JOH 12:47 If anyone listens to my sayings, and does not trust, I don’t judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
JOH 12:48 He who refuses ·to set aside, neutralize, violate, cast off, nullify, make void· me, and does not receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.
JOH 12:49 For I spoke not from myself, but haAbba ·the Father· who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
JOH 12:50 I know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as haAbba ·the Father· has said to me, so I speak.”
JOH 13:1 Now before the festival of the Pesac ·Passover· (Nissan 14), Yeshua [Salvation], knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to haAbba ·the Father·, having agapao ·total devoted love· for his own who were in the world, he showed agapao ·total devotion love· to them unto the end.
JOH 13:2 During supper, the devil [Accuser] having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot [Praised Dagger-man], Simeon [Hearing]’s son, to betray him,
JOH 13:3 Yeshua [Salvation], knowing that haAbba ·the Father· had given all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and was going to God,
JOH 13:4 arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
JOH 13:5 Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
JOH 13:6 Then he came to Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock]. He said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”
JOH 13:7 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.”
JOH 13:8 Peter [Rock] said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “If I don’t wash you, you have no part with me.”
JOH 13:9 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”
JOH 13:10 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.”
JOH 13:11 For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, “You are not all clean.”
JOH 13:12 So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?
JOH 13:13 You call me, ‘Rabbi ·Teacher·’ and ‘Master.’ You say so correctly, for so I am.
JOH 13:14 If I then, the Master and the Rabbi ·Teacher·, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
JOH 13:15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.
JOH 13:16 Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.
JOH 13:17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
JOH 13:18 I don’t speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats matzah ·unleavened bread· with me has lifted up his heel against me.’
JOH 13:19 From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may trust that Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)].
JOH 13:20 Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”
JOH 13:21 When Yeshua [Salvation] had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, “Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”
JOH 13:22 The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke.
JOH 13:23 One of his disciples, the one whom Yeshua [Salvation] felt agapao ·total devotion love· for, was at the table, leaning against Yeshua's [Salvation]'s chest.
JOH 13:24 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.”
JOH 13:25 He, leaning back, as he was, on Yeshua's [Salvation]'s chest, asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
JOH 13:26 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore answered, “It is he to whom I will give this piece of matzah ·unleavened bread· when I have dipped it (in the bitter herbs).” So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas [Praised], the son of Simeon [Hearing] from K'riot.
JOH 13:27 After the piece of matzah ·unleavened bread·, then Satan [Adversary] entered into him. Then Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “What you do, do quickly.”
JOH 13:28 Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.
JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas [Praised] had the money box, that Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Buy what things we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.
JOH 13:30 Therefore having received that piece of matzah ·unleavened bread·, he went out immediately. It was night.
JOH 13:31 When he had gone out, Yeshua [Salvation] said, “Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.
JOH 13:32 If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
JOH 13:33 Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews [Praisers], ‘Where I am going, you can’t come,’ so now I tell you.
JOH 13:34 A new commandment I give to you, that you show agapao ·total devotion love· to one another. Just as I have had agapao ·totally devoted love· towards you, you also show agapao ·totally devoted love· to one another.
JOH 13:35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have agape ·unconditional love· for one another.”
JOH 13:36 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “Where I am going, you can’t follow now, but you will follow afterwards.”
JOH 13:37 Peter [Rock] said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
JOH 13:38 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won’t crow until you have denied me three times.
JOH 14:1 “Don’t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.
JOH 14:2 In 'Avi ·my Father·’s house are many homes. If it was not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.
JOH 14:3 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.
JOH 14:4 Where I go, you know, and you know the way.”
JOH 14:5 Thomas [Seeker of truth] said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”
JOH 14:6 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “ Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to haAbba ·the Father·, except through me.
JOH 14:7 If you had known me, you would have known 'Avi ·my Father· also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him.”
JOH 14:8 Philip [Loves horses] said to him, “Lord, show us haAbba ·the Father·, and that will be enough for us.”
JOH 14:9 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip [Loves horses]? He who has seen me has seen haAbba ·the Father·. How do you say, ‘Show us haAbba ·the Father·?’
JOH 14:10 Don’t you trust that I am in haAbba ·the Father·, and haAbba ·the Father· in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but haAbba ·the Father· who lives in me does his works.
JOH 14:11 Believe me that I am in haAbba ·the Father·, and haAbba ·the Father· in me; or else trust me for the very works’ sake.
JOH 14:12 Most certainly I tell you, he who trusts in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to 'Avi ·my Father·.
JOH 14:13 Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that haAbba ·the Father· may be glorified in the Son.
JOH 14:14 If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.
JOH 14:15 If you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me, keep my commandments.
JOH 14:16 I will pray to haAbba ·the Father·, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever,
JOH 14:17 haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] of truth, whom the world can’t receive; for it does not see him, neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.
JOH 14:18 I will not leave you orphans. I am coming to you.
JOH 14:19 Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.
JOH 14:20 In that day you will know that I am in 'Avi ·my Father·, and you in me, and I in you.
JOH 14:21 One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who has agapao ·totally devoted love· for me. One who has agapao ·total devotion love· for me will receive agapao ·total devotion love· from 'Avi ·my Father·, and I will have agapao ·totally devoted love· for him, and will reveal myself to him.”
JOH 14:22 Judas [Praised] (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?”
JOH 14:23 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “If a man has agapao ·total devotion love· for me, he will keep my word. 'Avi [My Father] will have agapao ·total devoted love· for him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.
JOH 14:24 He who does not have agapao ·total devotion love· for me does not keep my words. The word which you hear is not mine, but from haAbba ·the Father· who sent me.
JOH 14:25 I have said these things to you, while still living with you.
JOH 14:26 But the Counselor, Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness], whom Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.
JOH 14:27 Shalom ·Complete peace· I leave with you. I am giving you my shalom ·complete peace·; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don’t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
JOH 14:28 You heard how I told you, ‘I go away, and I come to you.’ If you have agapao ·total devotion love· for me, you would have rejoiced, because I said ‘I am going to 'Avi ·my Father·;’ for Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· is greater than I.
JOH 14:29 Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may trust.
JOH 14:30 I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.
JOH 14:31 But that the world may know that I have agapao ·total devotion love· for haAbba ·the Father·, I do as haAbba ·the Father· enjoined me. Arise, let us go from here.
JOH 15:1 “Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the true vine, and 'Avi ·my Father· is the farmer.
JOH 15:2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
JOH 15:3 You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
JOH 15:4 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
JOH 15:5 Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)] the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
JOH 15:6 If a man does not remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
JOH 15:7 If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.
JOH 15:8 “In this is 'Avi ·my Father· glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.
JOH 15:9 Even as haAbba ·the Father· has agapao ·totally devoted love· for me, I also have shown agapao ·totally devoted love· for you. Remain in my agape ·unconditional love·.
JOH 15:10 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my agape ·unconditional love·; even as I have kept 'Avi ·my Father·’s commandments, and remain in his agape ·unconditional love·.
JOH 15:11 I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.
JOH 15:12 “This is my commandment, that you have agapao ·total devotion love· to one another, even as I have shown agapao ·total devotion love· to you.
JOH 15:13 Greater agape ·unconditional love· has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.
JOH 15:14 You are my friends, if you do whatever I enjoin you.
JOH 15:15 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from 'Avi ·my Father·, I have made known to you.
JOH 15:16 You didn’t choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of haAbba ·the Father· in my name, he may give it to you.
JOH 15:17 “I enjoin these things to you, that you may have agapao ·totally devoted love· to one another.
JOH 15:18 If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.
JOH 15:19 If you were of the world, the world would phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
JOH 15:20 Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
JOH 15:21 But all these things will they do to you for my name’s sake, because they don’t know him who sent me.
JOH 15:22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had abstract sin ·miss the mark·; but now they have no excuse for their abstract sin ·miss the mark·.
JOH 15:23 He who hates me, hates 'Avi ·my Father· also.
JOH 15:24 If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have had abstract sin ·miss the mark·. But now have they seen and also hated both me and 'Avi ·my Father·.
JOH 15:25 But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their Torah ·Teaching, ‘They hated me for no reason at all.’
JOH 15:26 “When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from haAbba ·the Father·, haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] of truth, who proceeds from haAbba ·the Father·, he will testify about me.
JOH 15:27 You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
JOH 16:1 “These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn’t be caused to be scandalized ·to entrap, to cause weak knees that waiver, stumbling block that causes falling, distrusting one that should be trusted and obeyed, disapproving of authority, to judge unfavorably causing displeasure, indignant·.
JOH 16:2 They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.
JOH 16:3 They will do these things because they have not known haAbba ·the Father·, nor me.
JOH 16:4 But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
JOH 16:5 But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
JOH 16:6 But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
JOH 16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.
JOH 16:8 When he has come, he will convict the world about abstract sin ·miss the mark·, about righteousness, and about judgment;
JOH 16:9 about abstract sin ·miss the mark·, because they don’t trust in me;
JOH 16:10 about righteousness, because I am going to 'Avi ·my Father·, and you won’t see me any more;
JOH 16:11 about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
JOH 16:12 “I have yet many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now.
JOH 16:13 However when he, haRuach [the Spirit, Breath] of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming.
JOH 16:14 He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.
JOH 16:15 All things whatever haAbba ·the Father· has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you.
JOH 16:16 A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.”
JOH 16:17 Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’ and, ‘Because I go to haAbba ·the Father·’?”
JOH 16:18 They said therefore, “What is this that he says, ‘A little while’? We don’t know what he is saying.”
JOH 16:19 Therefore Yeshua [Salvation] perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, “Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’
JOH 16:20 Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
JOH 16:21 A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she does not remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.
JOH 16:22 Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.
JOH 16:23 “In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of haAbba ·the Father· in my name, he will give it to you.
JOH 16:24 Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
JOH 16:25 I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about haAbba ·the Father·.
JOH 16:26 In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you, that I will pray to haAbba ·the Father· for you,
JOH 16:27 for haAbba ·the Father· himself phileo ·affectionate loves, has high regard for· you, because you have phileo ·affectionate loves, high regard for· me, and have trusted that I came from God.
JOH 16:28 I came from haAbba ·the Father·, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to haAbba ·the Father·.”
JOH 16:29 His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.
JOH 16:30 Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we trust that you came from God.”
JOH 16:31 Yeshua [Salvation] answered them, “Do you now trust?
JOH 16:32 Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because haAbba ·the Father· is with me.
JOH 16:33 I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”
JOH 17:1 Yeshua [Salvation] said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, “ Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;
JOH 17:2 even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
JOH 17:3 This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Yeshua Messiah [Salvation Anointed one].
JOH 17:4 I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
JOH 17:5 Now, Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.
JOH 17:6 I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.
JOH 17:7 Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,
JOH 17:8 for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from you, and they have trusted that you sent me.
JOH 17:9 I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
JOH 17:10 All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.
JOH 17:11 I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
JOH 17:12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
JOH 17:13 But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
JOH 17:14 I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
JOH 17:15 I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.
JOH 17:16 They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
JOH 17:17 Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.
JOH 17:18 As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.
JOH 17:19 For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
JOH 17:20 Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who trust in me through their word,
JOH 17:21 that they may all be one; even as you, Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may trust that you sent me.
JOH 17:22 The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
JOH 17:23 I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and have agapao ·totally devoted love· for them, even as you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me.
JOH 17:24 Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad·, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me from before the foundation of the world.
JOH 17:25 Righteous Abba Father, the world has not known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.
JOH 17:26 I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the agape ·unconditional love· with which you have agapao ·totally devoted love· to me may be in them, and I in them.”
JOH 18:1 When Yeshua [Salvation] had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered.
JOH 18:2 Now Judas [Praised], who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Yeshua [Salvation] often met there with his disciples.
JOH 18:3 Judas [Praised] then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees [Separated], came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
JOH 18:4 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went out, and said to them, “Who are you looking for?”
JOH 18:5 They answered him, “Yeshua [Salvation] of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one].” Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “I am he.” Judas [Praised] also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
JOH 18:6 When therefore he said to them, “Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)],” they went backward, and fell to the ground.
JOH 18:7 Again therefore he asked them, “Who are you looking for?” They said, “Yeshua [Salvation] of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one].”
JOH 18:8 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “I told you that Ena Na [I AM (the Living God)]. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,”
JOH 18:9 that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, “Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none.”
JOH 18:10 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] therefore, having a machaira ·machete, small sword knife·, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
JOH 18:11 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to Peter [Rock], “Put the machaira ·machete, small sword knife· into its sheath. The cup which haAbba ·the Father· has given me, shall I not surely drink it?”
JOH 18:12 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews [Praisers], seized Yeshua [Salvation] and bound him,
JOH 18:13 and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out], who was high priest that year.
JOH 18:14 Now it was Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out] who advised the Jews [Praisers] that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.
JOH 18:15 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] followed Yeshua [Salvation], as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Yeshua [Salvation] into the court of the high priest;
JOH 18:16 but Peter [Rock] was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter [Rock].
JOH 18:17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter [Rock], “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?” He said, “I am not.”
JOH 18:18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter [Rock] was with them, standing and warming himself.
JOH 18:19 The high priest therefore asked Yeshua [Salvation] about his disciples, and about his teaching.
JOH 18:20 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews [Praisers] always meet. I said nothing in secret.
JOH 18:21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said.”
JOH 18:22 When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Yeshua [Salvation] with his hand, saying, “Do you answer the high priest like that?”
JOH 18:23 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?”
JOH 18:24 Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out], the high priest.
JOH 18:25 Now Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it, and said, “I am not.”
JOH 18:26 One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter [Rock] had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”
JOH 18:27 Peter [Rock] therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
JOH 18:28 They led Yeshua [Salvation] therefore from Caiaphas [Rock that hollows itself out] into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Pesac ·Passover· meal (Nissan 14).
JOH 18:29 Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore went out to them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”
JOH 18:30 They answered him, “If this man was not an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”
JOH 18:31 Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” Therefore the Jews [Praisers] said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,”
JOH 18:32 that the word of Yeshua [Salvation] might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
JOH 18:33 Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Yeshua [Salvation], and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews [Praisers]?”
JOH 18:34 Yeshua [Salvation] answered him, “Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?”
JOH 18:35 Pilate [Armed with javelin] answered, “I’m not a Jew [Praiser], am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?”
JOH 18:36 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I would not be delivered to the Jews [Praisers]. But now my Kingdom is not from here.”
JOH 18:37 Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore said to him, “Are you a king then?” Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.”
JOH 18:38 Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to him, “What is truth?” When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews [Praisers], and said to them, “I find no basis for a charge against him.
JOH 18:39 But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews [Praisers]?”
JOH 18:40 Then they all shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Bar-Abba [Son Father]!” Now Bar-Abba [Son Father] was a robber.
JOH 19:1 So Pilate [Armed with javelin] then took Yeshua [Salvation], and flogged him.
JOH 19:2 The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
JOH 19:3 They kept saying, “Hail, King of the Jews [Praisers]!” and they kept slapping him.
JOH 19:4 Then Pilate [Armed with javelin] went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”
JOH 19:5 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “Behold, the man!”
JOH 19:6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.”
JOH 19:7 The Jews answered him, “We have a law (of God), and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·.”
JOH 19:8 When therefore Pilate [Armed with javelin] heard this saying, he was more afraid.
JOH 19:9 He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Yeshua [Salvation], “Where are you from?” But Yeshua [Salvation] gave him no answer.
JOH 19:10 Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore said to him, “Are not you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”
JOH 19:11 Yeshua [Salvation] answered, “You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater abstract sin ·miss the mark·.”
JOH 19:12 At this, Pilate [Armed with javelin] was seeking to release him, but the Jews [Praisers] cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s [Ruler]’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar [Ruler]!”
JOH 19:13 When Pilate [Armed with javelin] therefore heard these words, he brought Yeshua [Salvation] out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew [Immigrant], “Gabbatha.”
JOH 19:14 Now it was the Preparation Day for Pesac ·Passover· (Nissan 14), at about three o'clock in the afternoon. He said to the Jews [Praisers], “Behold, your King!”
JOH 19:15 They cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate [Armed with javelin] said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar [Ruler]!”
JOH 19:16 So then he delivered him to them to be nailed to the execution-stake. So they took Yeshua [Salvation] and led him away.
JOH 19:17 He went out, bearing his execution-stake, to the place called “Skull,” which is called in Hebrew [Immigrant], “Golgotha [Place of skull],”
JOH 19:18 where they nailed him to the stake, and with him two others, on either side one, and Yeshua [Salvation] in the middle.
JOH 19:19 Pilate [Armed with javelin] wrote a title also, and put it on the execution-stake. There was written, “Yeshua of Nazareth [Salvation of Branch, Separated one], The King of The Jews [Praisers] .”
JOH 19:20 Therefore many of the Jews [Praisers] read this title, for the place where Yeshua [Salvation] was executed on the stake was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew [Immigrant], in Latin, and in Greek.
JOH 19:21 The chief priests of the Jews [Praisers] therefore said to Pilate [Armed with javelin], “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews [Praisers],’ but, ‘he said, I am King of the Jews [Praisers].’”
JOH 19:22 Pilate [Armed with javelin] answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
JOH 19:23 Then the soldiers, when they had nailed Yeshua [Salvation] to the stake, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
JOH 19:24 Then they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, “They divided my garments among them. For my cloak they cast lots.” Therefore the soldiers did these things.
JOH 19:25 But there were standing by the execution-stake of Yeshua [Salvation] his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary [Rebellion] the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower].
JOH 19:26 Therefore when Yeshua [Salvation] saw his mother, and the disciple whom he felt agapao ·totally devoted love· for standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”
JOH 19:27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.
JOH 19:28 After this, Yeshua [Salvation], seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty.”
JOH 19:29 Now a vessel full of vinegar was set; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.
JOH 19:30 When Yeshua [Salvation] therefore had received the vinegar, he said, “It is finished.” He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
JOH 19:31 Therefore the Jews [Praisers], because it was the Preparation Day (Nissan 14), so that the bodies would not remain on the execution-stake on the festival Sabbath ·To cease· (for that Sabbath ·To cease· was a special one), asked of Pilate [Armed with javelin] that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
JOH 19:32 Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was placed on execution-stakes with him;
JOH 19:33 but when they came to Yeshua [Salvation], and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his legs.
JOH 19:34 However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
JOH 19:35 He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is trutheree. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may trust.
JOH 19:36 For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “Not one of his bones will be broken.”
JOH 19:37 Again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they pierced.”
JOH 19:38 After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea [May he add of Lofty place], being a disciple of Yeshua [Salvation], but secretly for fear of the Jews [Praisers], asked of Pilate [Armed with javelin] that he might take away Yeshua's [Salvation]'s body. Pilate [Armed with javelin] gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.
JOH 19:39 Nicodemus [Victory people], who at first came to Yeshua [Salvation] by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred Roman pounds [72.5 lb; 3,289 kg].
JOH 19:40 So they took Yeshua's [Salvation]'s body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews [Praisers] is to bury.
JOH 19:41 Now in the place where he was executed on the stake there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.
JOH 19:42 Then because of the Judean [Person from Praise] Preparation Day (Nissan 14) (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Yeshua [Salvation] there.
JOH 20:1 Now early morning, while it was still dark, on the first day of the week (Nissan 17, the day of First Fruits #1), Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower] went to the tomb and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
JOH 20:2 Therefore she ran and came to Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock], and to the other disciple whom Yeshua [Salvation] phileo ·affectionate loved, had high regard for·, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have laid him!”
JOH 20:3 Therefore Peter [Rock] and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
JOH 20:4 They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter [Rock], and came to the tomb first.
JOH 20:5 Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in.
JOH 20:6 Then Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,
JOH 20:7 and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
JOH 20:8 So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and trusted.
JOH 20:9 (For they had not yet understand the Scripture teaches that the Messiah [Anointed one] had to rise from the dead.)
JOH 20:10 So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
JOH 20:11 But Mary [Rebellion] was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
JOH 20:12 and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Yeshua [Salvation] had lain.
JOH 20:13 They told her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”
JOH 20:14 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Yeshua [Salvation] standing, and didn’t know that it was Yeshua [Salvation].
JOH 20:15 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
JOH 20:16 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Mary [Rebellion].” She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!” which is to say, “·My Teacher·!”
JOH 20:17 Yeshua [Salvation] said to her, “Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to 'Avi ·my Father·; but go to my brothers, and tell them, ‘I am ascending to 'Avi ·my Father· and 'Avikah ·your Father·, to my God and your God.’”
JOH 20:18 Mary of Magdala [Rebellion of City tower] came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
JOH 20:19 Therefore when evening came that day, the (end of the) first day of the week, (the start of Nissan 18), and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews [Praisers], Yeshua [Salvation] came and stood in the middle, and said to them, “ Shalom aleikhem! ·Complete peace my family·!”
JOH 20:20 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.
JOH 20:21 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them again, “ Shalom aleikhem! ·Complete peace my family·! As Abba ·Father familiar, Dear Dad· has sent me, even so I send you.”
JOH 20:22 When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive Ruach haKodesh [Spirit, Breath of the Holiness]!
JOH 20:23 If you forgive anyone’s abstract sins ·miss the marks·, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s abstract sins ·miss the marks· , they have been retained.”
JOH 20:24 But Thomas [Seeker of truth], one of the twelve, called Didymus [Twin] in Greek, was not with them when Yeshua [Salvation] came.
JOH 20:25 The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Master!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not trust.”
JOH 20:26 After eight days (Nissan 26) again his disciples were inside, and Thomas [Seeker of truth] was with them. Yeshua [Salvation] came, the doors being locked, and stood in the middle, and said, “Shalom aleikhem! ·Complete peace my family·!”
JOH 20:27 Then he said to Thomas [Seeker of truth], “Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don’t be unbelieving, but believing.”
JOH 20:28 Thomas [Seeker of truth] answered him, “My Master and my God!”
JOH 20:29 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Because you have seen me, you have trusted. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have trusted.”
JOH 20:30 Therefore Yeshua [Salvation] did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
JOH 20:31 but these are written, that you may trust that Yeshua [Salvation] is the Messiah [Anointed one], the Ben-Elohim ·Son of Elohim God·, and that believing you may have life in his name.
JOH 21:1 After these things, Yeshua [Salvation] revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way.
JOH 21:2 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock], Thomas [Seeker of truth] called Didymus [Twin] in Greek, Nathanael [Given by God] of Cana in Galilee [District, Circuit], and the sons of Zebedee [Bestowed by Yah], and two others of his disciples were together.
JOH 21:3 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] said to them, “I’m going fishing.” They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.
JOH 21:4 But when day had already come, Yeshua [Salvation] stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn’t know that it was Yeshua [Salvation].
JOH 21:5 Yeshua [Salvation] therefore said to them, “Children, have you anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.”
JOH 21:6 He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” They cast it therefore, and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.
JOH 21:7 That disciple therefore whom Yeshua [Salvation] felt agapao ·totally devoted love· for said to Peter [Rock], “It’s the Master!” So when Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] heard that it was the Master, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.
JOH 21:8 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away [300 ft; 914.4 m]), dragging the net full of fish.
JOH 21:9 So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
JOH 21:10 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”
JOH 21:11 Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock] went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net was not torn.
JOH 21:12 Yeshua [Salvation] said to them, “Come and eat breakfast.” None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing that it was the Master.
JOH 21:13 Then Yeshua [Salvation] came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
JOH 21:14 This is now the third time that Yeshua [Salvation] was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
JOH 21:15 So when they had eaten their breakfast, Yeshua [Salvation] said to Simeon Peter [Hearing Rock], “Simeon [Hearing], son of Jonah [Dove], do you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Master; you know that I phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.”
JOH 21:16 He said to him again a second time, “Simeon [Hearing], son of Jonah [Dove], do you have agapao ·totally devoted love· for me?” He said to him, “Yes, Master; you know that I phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.”
JOH 21:17 He said to him the third time, “Simeon [Hearing], son of Jonah [Dove], do you phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· me?” Peter [Rock] was grieved because he asked him the third time, “Do you phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· me?” He said to him, “Master, you know everything. You know that I phileo ·affectionately love, have high regard for· you.” Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “Feed my sheep.
JOH 21:18 Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you don’t want to go.”
JOH 21:19 Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”
JOH 21:20 Then Peter [Rock], turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Yeshua [Salvation] felt agapao ·totally devoted love· for, the one who had also leaned on Yeshua [Salvation]’s chest at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray You?”
JOH 21:21 Peter [Rock] seeing him, said to Yeshua [Salvation], “Master, what about this man?”
JOH 21:22 Yeshua [Salvation] said to him, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.”
JOH 21:23 This saying therefore went out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn’t die. Yet Yeshua [Salvation] didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?”
JOH 21:24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true.
JOH 21:25 There are also many other things which Yeshua [Salvation] did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself would not have room for the books that would be written.
