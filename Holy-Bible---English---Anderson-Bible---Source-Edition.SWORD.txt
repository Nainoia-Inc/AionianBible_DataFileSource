He began his investigations at the age of twenty-one, and has faithfully studied the Original since that time. He has made his translation without reference to any version; that is, he adopted no version as a basis. His work is not a Revision of a version, but a Translation; for he was not disposed to be trammeled by any version, but desired to find the truth of God, as it is contained in the Original. The truth thus found, he has endeavored to express in the English language as now spoken. He has been careful to express the exact sense of the Original, without permitting himself to be confined to an imitation of the letter of the Greek. In revising his work, he re-examined the common version, and wherever that version has expressed the sense of the Original in good English, he has adopted it. In this way he has, as he hopes, embodied all the excellencies of that version, and avoided its errors. <div eID="gen7" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen8" type="x-p"/> The author takes pleasure in acknowledging himself largely indebted, for the English dress of the Translation, to his friend, and brother in Christ, <hi type="small-caps">John Augustus Williams</hi>, of Harrodsburg, Kentucky. <div eID="gen8" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen9" type="x-p"/> The work has been carried on under many adverse circumstances; but, by the good providence of God, it has been completed. May it go forth, under the Divine blessing, to establish and comfort the hearts of those who love the Truth. <div eID="gen9" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen10" type="x-p"/> <signed sID="gen11"/>H. T.

Matthew 1:1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. <div eID="gen15" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen16" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 1:2 Abraham begot Isaac: Isaac begot Jacob: Jacob begot Judah and his brothers:

Matthew 1:4 Aram begot Aminidab: Aminidab begot Nahshon: Nahshon begot Salmon:
Matthew 1:5 Salmon begot Boa of Rachab: Boaz begot Obed of Ruth: Obed begot Jesse:

Matthew 1:16 Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. <div eID="gen17" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen18" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 1:17 So all the generations from Abraham till David are fourteen generations: and from David till the removal to Babylon are fourteen generations: and from the removal to Babylon till the Christ are fourteen generations. <div eID="gen18" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen19" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 1:18 But Jesus Christ was begotten thus: After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they had come together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew 1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not choosing to make an example of her, intended to put her away privately.
Matthew 1:20 But while he was thinking of these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take home Mary your wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew 1:21 And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins.
Matthew 1:22 Now all this was done, that the word might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
Matthew 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called Immanuel, which, when translated, is, God with us.
Matthew 1:24 And Joseph awoke from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; and he took home his wife,
Matthew 1:25 and knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son. And he called his name Jesus.  <chapter eID="Matt.1"/> <div eID="gen19" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 2:0 <milestone n="II." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen20" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="2" osisID="Matt.2" sID="Matt.2"/>
Matthew 2:1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem,
Matthew 2:2 saying: Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage.
Matthew 2:3 When Herod the king heard <transChange type="added">these things</transChange>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Matthew 2:4 And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.
Matthew 2:5 And they said to him: In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet:
Matthew 2:6 And thou, Bethlehem, city of Judah, art by no means the least among the chiefs of Judah; for out of thee shall come a leader, that shall be a shepherd to my people Israel. <div eID="gen20" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen21" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 2:7 Then Herod, when he had secretly called the Magi, inquired of them strictly at what time the star, then visible, first made its appearance:
Matthew 2:8 and sending them to Bethlehem, he said: Go, make strict inquiry for the young child: and when you have found him, bring me word, that I also may go and do him homage.
Matthew 2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over the place where the young child was.
Matthew 2:10 And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.
Matthew 2:11 And having come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they did him homage. And when they had opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Matthew 2:12 And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way. <div eID="gen21" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen22" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 2:13 When they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there till I bring you word; for Herod is about to seek for the young child, to destroy him.
Matthew 2:14 And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,
Matthew 2:15 and was there till the death of Herod; that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through his prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have I called my Son. <div eID="gen22" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen23" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the Magi, was greatly enraged, and sent out and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem and in all its borders, from the age of two years and under, according to the time which he had strictly inquired of the Magi.
Matthew 2:17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
Matthew 2:18 A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted because they are no more. <div eID="gen23" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen24" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
Matthew 2:20 saying: Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the young child’s life.
Matthew 2:21 And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew 2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither. But being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the regions of Galilee,
Matthew 2:23 and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets: He shall be called a Nazarene.  <chapter eID="Matt.2"/> <div eID="gen24" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 3:0 <milestone n="III." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen25" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="3" osisID="Matt.3" sID="Matt.3"/>
Matthew 3:1 In those days came John the Immerser, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
Matthew 3:2 and saying: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
Matthew 3:4 But the same John had his clothing of camel’s hair, and a girdle of leather around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey. <div eID="gen25" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen26" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,
Matthew 3:6 and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
Matthew 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them: Generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coining wrath?
Matthew 3:8 Bring forth, therefore, fruit worthy of repentance:
Matthew 3:9 and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
Matthew 3:10 Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees: therefore, every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew 3:11 I immerse you in water, in order to repentance; but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:
Matthew 3:12 whose winnowing-shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his thrashing-floor, and gather his grain into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. <div eID="gen26" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen27" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 3:13 Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be immersed by him.
Matthew 3:14 But John forbade him, saying: I have need to be immersed by thee, and comest thou to me?
Matthew 3:15 But Jesus answering said to him: Permit it now; for thus it becomes us to perform fully every righteous act. Then he permitted him.
Matthew 3:16 And after Jesus was immersed, he came up immediately from the water; and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.
Matthew 3:17 And lo, a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.  <chapter eID="Matt.3"/> <div eID="gen27" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 4:0 <milestone n="IV." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen28" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="4" osisID="Matt.4" sID="Matt.4"/>
Matthew 4:1 Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
Matthew 4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.
Matthew 4:3 And the tempter came to him and said: If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
Matthew 4:4 But he answered and said: It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.
Matthew 4:5 Then the devil took him into the holy city, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,
Matthew 4:6 and said to him: If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: He will give his angels charge concerning you; and in their hands shall they take you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
Matthew 4:7 Jesus said to him: It is again written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof. <div eID="gen28" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen29" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 4:8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,
Matthew 4:9 and said to him: All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.
Matthew 4:10 Then Jesus said to him: Get behind me, Satan, for it is written: You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.
Matthew 4:11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. <div eID="gen29" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen30" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 4:12 Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up; he withdrew into Galilee;
Matthew 4:13 and, leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea, in the borders of Zebulon and Naphtali,
Matthew 4:14 that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
Matthew 4:15 The land of Zebulon, and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
Matthew 4:16 the people that sat in darkness saw great light; and upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has risen.
Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. <div eID="gen30" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen31" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 4:18 And as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, throwing a net into the sea, for they were fishers.
Matthew 4:19 And he said to them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
Matthew 4:20 And they immediately left their nets and followed him.
Matthew 4:21 And going on thence, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
Matthew 4:22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. <div eID="gen31" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen32" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 4:23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease, and every kind of sickness among the people.
Matthew 4:24 And his fame went abroad into all Syria. And they brought to him all that were sick, those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were possessed with demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he cured them.
Matthew 4:25 And many multitudes followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.  <chapter eID="Matt.4"/> <div eID="gen32" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:0 <milestone n="V." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen33" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="5" osisID="Matt.5" sID="Matt.5"/>
Matthew 5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him;
Matthew 5:2 and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
Matthew 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 5:4 Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.
Matthew 5:5 Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.
Matthew 5:6 Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness; for they shall be filled.
Matthew 5:7 Blessed are the merciful; for they shall receive mercy.
Matthew 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.
Matthew 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called sons of God.
Matthew 5:10 Blessed are they that are persecuted on account of righteousness; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 5:11 Blessed are you, when they shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, falsely, on my account.
Matthew 5:12 Rejoice, and leap for joy; for great is your reward in heaven: for so did they persecute the prophets who were before you. <div eID="gen33" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen34" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:13 You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has become tasteless, by what means shall it become salt again? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trod upon by men.
Matthew 5:14 You are the light of the world: a city that lies upon a mountain can not be hid:
Matthew 5:15 neither do men light a lamp and place it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all that are in the house.
Matthew 5:16 In this way let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. <div eID="gen34" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen35" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:17 Think not that I have come to make the law or the prophets of no effect. I have not come to make them of no effect, but to give them their full efficiency.
Matthew 5:18 For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one yod<index index="Glossary" level1="YOD"/> or one point shall in no way pass from the law till all be fulfilled.
Matthew 5:19 Whoever, therefore, shall make void one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 5:20 For I say to you, That, unless your righteousness excel that of the scribes and Pharisees, you can by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven. <div eID="gen35" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen36" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:21 You have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill, shall be liable to the sentence of the judges.
Matthew 5:22 But I say to you, Whoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be liable to the sentence of the judges. And whoever shall say to his brother, Worthless fellow, shall be liable to the sentence of the Sanhedrin. But who ever shall say, Impious wretch, shall be in danger of hell-fire.
Matthew 5:23 If, therefore, you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has any thing against you,
Matthew 5:24 leave your gift there before the altar, and go, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
Matthew 5:25 Come to an agreement with your opponent at law quickly, while you are on the road with him, lest your opponent at law deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
Matthew 5:26 Verily, I say to you, You shall by no means come out thence, till you have paid the last farthing. <div eID="gen36" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen37" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:27 You have heard that it was said: You shall not commit adultery.
Matthew 5:28 But I say to you, Whoever looks upon a woman to cherish desire for her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew 5:29 If, then, your right eye ensnare you, tear it out, and throw it from you; for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
Matthew 5:30 And if your right hand ensnare you, cut it off, and throw it from you; for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be thrown into hell. <div eID="gen37" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen38" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:31 It has been said: Whoever will put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce.
Matthew 5:32 But I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, unless on account of lewdness, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever marries her that is divorced, commits adultery.
Matthew 5:33 Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but shall pay to the Lord your vows.
Matthew 5:34 But I say to you, Swear not at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
Matthew 5:35 nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King:
Matthew 5:36 neither shall you swear by your head, for you can not make one hair white or black.
Matthew 5:37 But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatever is more than these is of the Evil One. <div eID="gen38" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen39" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:38 You have heard that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
Matthew 5:39 But I say to you, Resist not the injurious. But whoever will smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
Matthew 5:40 And to him that will go to law with you, and take away your coat, give your mantle also.
Matthew 5:41 And whoever will compel you to go one mile, go with him two.
Matthew 5:42 Give to him that asks of you; and from him that would borrow of you, turn not away. <div eID="gen39" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen40" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 5:43 You have heard that it was said: You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.
Matthew 5:44 But I say to you, Love your enemies: bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you:
Matthew 5:45 that you may be the sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and causes it to rain on the just and on the unjust.
Matthew 5:46 For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the publicans the same?
Matthew 5:47 And if you salute your brethren only, in what do you excel? Do not even the publicans so?
Matthew 5:48 Be you therefore perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.  <chapter eID="Matt.5"/> <div eID="gen40" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 6:0 <milestone n="VI." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen41" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="6" osisID="Matt.6" sID="Matt.6"/>
Matthew 6:1 Beware of doing your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
Matthew 6:2 When, therefore, you do a charitable deed, do not cause a trumpet to be sounded before you, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.
Matthew 6:3 But when you do a charitable deed, let not your left hand know what your right hand does;
Matthew 6:4 that your charitable deeds may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, himself will reward you openly. <div eID="gen41" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen42" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 6:5 And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.
Matthew 6:6 But do you, when you pray, go into your closet, and when you have closed the door, pray to your Father who is in secret: and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
Matthew 6:7 But when you pray, do not use vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
Matthew 6:8 Be not, therefore, like them; for your Father knows what things you need before you ask him. <div eID="gen42" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen43" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 6:9 In this manner, therefore, pray you: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Matthew 6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.
Matthew 6:11 Give us this day the bread for our support.
Matthew 6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
Matthew 6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One.
Matthew 6:14 For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
Matthew 6:15 But if you forgive not men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. <div eID="gen43" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen44" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 6:16 And when you fast, do not put on a sad countenance, as the hypocrites do; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to be fasting. Verily, I say to you, They have their reward.
Matthew 6:17 But do you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face;
Matthew 6:18 that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. <div eID="gen44" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen45" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal.
Matthew 6:20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.
Matthew 6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Matthew 6:22 The lamp of the body is the eye: if, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be light:
Matthew 6:23 But if your eye be diseased, your whole body will be dark. If therefore, the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! <div eID="gen45" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen46" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 6:24 No one can serve two masters: for he will either hate the one and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and riches.
Matthew 6:25 For this reason I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you shall eat, and what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not your life a greater gift than food, and your body than clothing?
Matthew 6:26 Observe the birds of the air, that they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into granaries. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
Matthew 6:27 Which of you, by his anxiety, can add one span to his life?
Matthew 6:28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow: they toil not, nor do they spin.
Matthew 6:29 But I say to you, That Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these.
Matthew 6:30 If then, God so clothes the herb of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Matthew 6:31 Therefore, be not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or, with what shall we be clothed?
Matthew 6:32 For after all these things do the Gentiles seek: for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
Matthew 6:33 But seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you in addition.
Matthew 6:34 Therefore, be not anxious about the morrow, for the morrow will have anxieties of its own. Sufficient for the day is its own evil.  <chapter eID="Matt.6"/> <div eID="gen46" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 12:9 And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue.
Matthew 12:10 And behold, a man was there that had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath-days? that they might accuse him.
Matthew 12:11 And he said to them: What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?
Matthew 12:12 How much better, then, is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath-days.
Matthew 12:13 Then he said to the man: Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored to soundness, like the other.
Matthew 12:14 But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him, that they might destroy him.
Matthew 12:15 But Jesus perceived it, and withdrew from that place. And many multitudes followed him, and he cured them all.
Matthew 12:16 And he charged them not to make him known;
Matthew 12:17 that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
Matthew 12:18 Be hold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall declare law to the Gentiles.
Matthew 12:19 He shall not contend, nor cry out; nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets.
Matthew 12:20 A bruised reed he shall not break, and a smoking wick he shall not extinguish, till he shall send forth his law for conquest.
Matthew 12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. <div eID="gen85" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen86" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 12:22 Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb: and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw.
Matthew 12:23 And all the people were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David?
Matthew 12:24 But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said: This man does not cast out the demons, unless by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
Matthew 12:25 But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And no city or house divided against itself shall stand.
Matthew 12:26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
Matthew 12:27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason, they shall be your judges.
Matthew 12:28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has already come upon you.
Matthew 12:29 Or, how can any one enter the house of the strong man and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.

Matthew 12:33 Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree unsound, and its fruit unsound. For by the fruit the tree is known.
Matthew 12:34 Generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
Matthew 12:35 The good man, out of his good treasury, brings forth good things; and the evil man, out of his evil treasury, brings forth evil things.
Matthew 12:36 But I say to you, That for every idle word which men speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.

Matthew 12:38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered and said: Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.
Matthew 12:39 But he answered and said to them: A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
Matthew 12:40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew 12:41 Tho men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it; for they repented in accordance with the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.

Matthew 12:45 Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be with this wicked generation. <div eID="gen89" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen90" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 12:48 But he answered and said to him that told him: Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?
Matthew 12:49 And he stretched out his hand toward his disciples, and said: Behold my mother and my brothers.

Matthew 13:3 And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: Behold, the sower went out to sow.
Matthew 13:4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way: and the birds came and ate them up.
Matthew 13:5 Others fell on stony places, where they had not much earth; and they immediately sprung up, because they had no depth of earth.
Matthew 13:6 But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Matthew 13:7 Others fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them.
Matthew 13:8 Others fell upon good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundred, some fifty, some thirty.
Matthew 13:9 He that has ears to hear, let him hear. <div eID="gen92" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen93" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:10 And the disciples came and said to him: Why dost thou speak to them in parables?
Matthew 13:11 He answered, and said to them: Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given.
Matthew 13:12 For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him.
Matthew 13:13 For this reason I speak to them in parables; because when they see, they see not; and when they hear, they hear not, nor do they understand.
Matthew 13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophesy of Isaiah, which says: You shall surely hear, and you will not understand; and you shall surely see, and you will not perceive.
Matthew 13:15 For the heart of this people has become fat; and with their ears they hear heavily; and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn to me, and I should give them health.
Matthew 13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Matthew 13:17 For verily I say to you, Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear. <div eID="gen93" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen94" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:18 Hear you, therefore, the parable of the sower.
Matthew 13:19 When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that received seed by the wayside.
Matthew 13:20 He that received seed on the stony places is he that hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy.
Matthew 13:21 Yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while; and when affliction or persecution arises on account of the word, he immediately takes offense.
Matthew 13:22 He that received seed among the thorns, is he that hears the word; and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Matthew 13:23 But he that received seed on the good ground, is he that hears the word and understands it; who also produces fruit, and yields, one a hundred; another, sixty; another, thirty. <div eID="gen94" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen95" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:24 Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field.
Matthew 13:25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
Matthew 13:26 But when the blade sprung up, and produced fruit, then appeared the tares also.
Matthew 13:27 And the servants of the master of the house came, and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Whence, then, has it tares?
Matthew 13:28 He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Is it your will, then, that we go and gather them up?
Matthew 13:29 But he said, No; lest while you are gathering the tares, you root up the wheat with them.
Matthew 13:30 Let both grow together till the harvest, and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares, and bind them into bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my granary. <div eID="gen95" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen96" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:31 Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, that a man took and sowed in his field.
Matthew 13:32 It is, indeed, the least of all seeds; but when it is grown it is the largest of garden-plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and roost in its branches. <div eID="gen96" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen97" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:33 He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.
Matthew 13:34 All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them;
Matthew 13:35 that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. <div eID="gen97" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen98" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:36 Then Jesus left the multitudes, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said: Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
Matthew 13:37 He answered and said to them: He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;
Matthew 13:38 the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; the tares are the sons of the Wicked One;
Matthew 13:39 the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.
Matthew 13:40 As, therefore, the tares are collected and burned in fire, so shall it be in the end of this age.
Matthew 13:41 The Son of man will send forth his angels, and collect out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who work iniquity,
Matthew 13:42 and cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew 13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear. <div eID="gen98" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen99" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field, which, when a man finds it, he hides; and for the joy it gives, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field. <div eID="gen99" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen100" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls.

Matthew 13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that is cast into the sea, and that gathers of every kind:
Matthew 13:48 when it is full, they draw it to the shore; and sitting down, they collect the good into vessels, but throw the bad away.
Matthew 13:49 So shall it be in the end of the age: the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the just,
Matthew 13:50 and cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <div eID="gen101" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen102" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 13:51 Jesus said to them: Have you understood all these things? They said to him: Yes, Lord.

Matthew 13:53 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.
Matthew 13:54 And he came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said: Whence has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
Matthew 13:55 Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?
Matthew 13:56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence, then, has this man all these things?
Matthew 13:57 And they found in him occasion for offense. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, unless it be in his own country and in his own house.
Matthew 13:58 And he did not many mighty works there, on account of their unbelief.  <chapter eID="Matt.13"/> <div eID="gen103" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 14:3 For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
Matthew 14:4 For John said to him: It is not lawful for you to have her.
Matthew 14:5 And he intended to put him to death, but feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.
Matthew 14:6 But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
Matthew 14:7 Wherefore he promised, with an oath, to give her whatever she would ask.
Matthew 14:8 And being previously instigated by her mother, she said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Immerser?
Matthew 14:9 And the king was grieved: but on account of his oath, and those who reclined at table with him, he commanded it to be given.
Matthew 14:10 And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew 14:11 And his head was brought in a dish, and given to the maiden: and she carried it to her mother.

Matthew 14:15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, and said: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
Matthew 14:16 But Jesus said to them: They need not go away; do you give them food.
Matthew 14:17 They said to him: We have here but five loaves and two fishes.
Matthew 14:18 He said: Bring them hither to me.
Matthew 14:19 And he commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass: and he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke, and gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples <transChange type="added">gave it</transChange> to the multitudes.
Matthew 14:20 And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what remained of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.

Matthew 14:27 But Jesus immediately spoke to them, and said: Take courage; it is I; be not afraid.
Matthew 14:28 And Peter answered him, and said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.
Matthew 14:29 And he said: Come. And Peter went down from the ship, and walked upon the water to go to Jesus.
Matthew 14:30 But when he saw the wind strong, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.

Matthew 15:1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees that were of Jerusalem, saying:
Matthew 15:2 Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
Matthew 15:3 But he answered and said to them: And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
Matthew 15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He that curses father or mother shall surely be put to death.
Matthew 15:5 But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever of mine might profit you, is a gift, he must in no way honor his father or his mother;

Matthew 15:7 Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,

Matthew 15:15 But Peter answered and said to him: Explain to us this dark saying.
Matthew 15:16 Jesus replied: Are you also yet without understanding?
Matthew 15:17 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth passes into the belly, and is cast out into the sink?
Matthew 15:18 But those things which go out from the mouth, come from the heart; and these defile the man.
Matthew 15:19 For from the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, lewd actions, thefts, false testimonies, impious words.

Matthew 15:23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she cries after us.
Matthew 15:24 But he answered and said: I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew 15:25 But she came and did him homage, saying: Lord, help me.

Matthew 16:17 And Jesus answered and said to him: Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah; for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew 16:18 And I say to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church: and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it.
Matthew 16:19 And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew 16:20 Then he charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ. <div eID="gen120" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen121" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 16:22 And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying: Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be to thee.
Matthew 16:23 But he turned and said to Peter: Get behind me, adversary; you are a snare to me: for you are not thinking of the things of God; but of the things of men. <div eID="gen121" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen122" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 16:24 Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any one determines to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Matthew 16:25 For whoever will save his life, shall lose it. But whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
Matthew 16:26 For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own life? Or, what will a man give as the ransom of his life?
Matthew 16:27 For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he will reward every one according to his deeds.

Matthew 17:1 And after six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up into a high mountain apart:
Matthew 17:2 and he was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his clothing was white as the light.
Matthew 17:3 And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.
Matthew 17:4 And Peter answered and said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Matthew 17:5 While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and lo, a voice from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight; hear him.
Matthew 17:6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were greatly afraid.
Matthew 17:7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said: Arise and be not afraid.

Matthew 17:11 Jesus answered and said to them: Elijah, indeed, comes first, and he will restore all things.
Matthew 17:12 But I say to you, That Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him what they wished; so also shall the Son of man suffer at their hands.
Matthew 17:13 Then, the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Immerser. <div eID="gen124" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen125" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 17:16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to cure him.
Matthew 17:17 Jesus answered and said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.
Matthew 17:18 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out of him: and the child was cured from that hour. <div eID="gen125" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen126" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 17:19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said: Why were we not able to cast him out?

Matthew 17:21 But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting. <div eID="gen126" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen127" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 17:25 He said: Yes. And when he had come into the house, before he had spoken, Jesus said to him: What think you, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tax or tribute? From their own sons, or from the sons of others?
Matthew 17:26 Peter said to him: From the sons of others. Jesus said to him: Then are their own sons free.

Matthew 18:3 and said: Verily I say to you, Unless you turn and become as little children, you can not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 18:4 Whoever, therefore, humbles himself as this little child, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 18:5 And whoever receives one such little child on my account, receives me;

Matthew 18:12 What think you? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them go astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine, and go into the mountains, and seek for that which has gone astray?
Matthew 18:13 And if it so be that he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

Matthew 18:22 Jesus said to him: I say to you, Not till seven times, but till seventy times seven.
Matthew 18:23 For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king that wished to settle accounts with his servants.
Matthew 18:24 And when he began to make a settlement, there was brought to him one that owed him ten thou sand talents.
Matthew 18:25 But as he was not able to pay, his lord commanded him, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, to be sold, and payment to be made.
Matthew 18:26 Therefore, the servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, Lord, and I will pay you all.
Matthew 18:27 And the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and let him go, and forgave him the debt. <div eID="gen134" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen135" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 18:29 Then his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.
Matthew 18:30 And he would not; but went and threw him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
Matthew 18:31 When his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sad, and went and made known to their lord all that was done.
Matthew 18:32 Then his lord called him and said to him: Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you besought me.

Matthew 21:35 And the vine-dressers took his servants, and scourged one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Matthew 21:36 Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them in like manner.
Matthew 21:37 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
Matthew 21:38 But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and seize upon the inheritance.
Matthew 21:39 And they took him, and carried him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
Matthew 21:40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers? <div eID="gen157" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen158" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 21:41 They said to him: He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and let out his vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will give him the fruits in their season.
Matthew 21:42 Jesus said to them: Did you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?
Matthew 21:43 This was from the Lord, and it is wondrous in our eyes. For this reason, I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation that will bring forth the fruits of it.
Matthew 21:44 And he that falls upon this stone shall be dashed to pieces; but him on whom it shall fall, it will make like chaff for the wind. <div eID="gen158" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen159" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 21:45 And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.

Matthew 22:1 And Jesus answering, spoke to them again in parables, saying:
Matthew 22:2 The kingdom of heaven is like a king that made a marriage feast for his son;
Matthew 22:3 and sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the marriage feast; and they refused to come.
Matthew 22:4 Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
Matthew 22:5 But they were careless, and went away, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.
Matthew 22:6 And the rest laid hold of his servants, and abused them, and killed them. <div eID="gen160" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen161" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 22:7 And when that king heard of it, he was angry, and sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Matthew 22:8 Then he said to his servants: The marriage feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
Matthew 22:9 Go, therefore, to the cross-ways, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.
Matthew 22:10 And those servants went out into the roads, and brought together all, as many as they found, both bad and good: and the banquet-room was filled with guests.
Matthew 22:11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man that had not put on a wedding-robe.
Matthew 22:12 And he said to him, Friend, how came you in hither without a wedding-robe? And he was silent.
Matthew 22:13 Then the king said to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and throw him into the darkness without: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew 22:14 For many are called, but few chosen. <div eID="gen161" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen162" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 22:15 Then the Pharisees went and held a consultation, that they might entrap him in his words.
Matthew 22:16 And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying: Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth, and care not for any one: for you do not look upon the person of men.
Matthew 22:17 Tell us, therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
Matthew 22:18 But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said to them: Why do you tempt me, hypocrites?
Matthew 22:19 Show me the tribute-money. And they brought him a denarius<index index="Glossary" level1="DENARIUS"/>.
Matthew 22:20 And he said to them: Whose image and superscription is this?
Matthew 22:21 They said to him: Cæsar’s. Then he said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
Matthew 22:22 And when they heard it, they were astonished, and left him, and went away. <div eID="gen162" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen163" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 22:23 On that day there came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they put a question to him,
Matthew 22:24 saying: Teacher, Moses commanded, If any one die without children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
Matthew 22:25 Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died; and, having no child, left his wife to his brother.
Matthew 22:26 In like manner also the second, and the third, to the seventh.
Matthew 22:27 Last of all, the woman also died.
Matthew 22:28 Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be the wife? for they all had her. <div eID="gen163" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen164" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 22:29 Jesus answered and said to them: You err, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
Matthew 22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
Matthew 22:31 But, concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying:
Matthew 22:32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
Matthew 22:33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. <div eID="gen164" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen165" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 22:34 When the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together.
Matthew 22:35 And one of them, who was a lawyer, asked him a question, that he might tempt him, saying:
Matthew 22:36 Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
Matthew 22:37 Jesus said to him: You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind.
Matthew 22:38 This is the first and great commandment.
Matthew 22:39 And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

Matthew 22:41 While the Pharisees were together, Jesus asked them a question,
Matthew 22:42 saying: What think you of the Christ? whose son is he? They said to him: The son of David.
Matthew 22:43 He said to them: How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
Matthew 22:44 The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
Matthew 22:45 If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?

Matthew 23:3 therefore, all things that they command you to observe, observe and do. But do not according to their works: for they command, and do not.
Matthew 23:4 For they bind up burdens that are heavy and hard to be borne, and lay them on the shoulders of men; but they refuse to move them with one of their fingers.
Matthew 23:5 And they do all their works for the purpose of being seen by men. They make their amulets broad, and enlarge the fringes of their mantles.
Matthew 23:6 They also love the most honorable places at suppers, and the first seats in the synagogues,

Matthew 26:6 When Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew 26:7 there came to him a woman who had an alabaster box of very costly ointment; and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table.
Matthew 26:8 But when his disciples saw it, they were displeased, and said: For what purpose was this waste?
Matthew 26:9 For this could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Matthew 26:10 Jesus perceived it, and said to them: Why do you trouble the woman? For she has performed a good work upon me.
Matthew 26:11 For you have the poor always with you, but me you have not always.
Matthew 26:12 For in pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.
Matthew 26:13 Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, this also which she has done shall be told for a memorial of her. <div eID="gen193" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen194" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
Matthew 26:15 and said: What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed to him thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew 26:16 And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up. <div eID="gen194" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen195" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:17 On the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, and said to him: Where dost thou wish that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
Matthew 26:18 He replied: Go into the city, to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the passover at your house, with my disciples.
Matthew 26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and prepared the passover. <div eID="gen195" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen196" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:20 When the evening had come, he reclined at table with the twelve.
Matthew 26:21 And as they were eating, he said: Verily I say to you, One of you will deliver me up.
Matthew 26:22 And they were very sad, and began each one of them to say to him: Lord, is it I?
Matthew 26:23 He answered and said: He that dips his hand with me in the dish, will deliver me up.
Matthew 26:24 The Son of man goes, as it is written of him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! It would have been good for that man, if he had not been born.
Matthew 26:25 And Judas, who delivered him up, answered and said: Rabbi, is it I? He replied: You have said. <div eID="gen196" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen197" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said: Take, eat; this is my body.
Matthew 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: Do you all drink of it:
Matthew 26:28 for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many in order to the remission of sins.
Matthew 26:29 But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father. <div eID="gen197" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen198" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
Matthew 26:31 Then Jesus said to them: All of you will he offended at me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
Matthew 26:32 But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
Matthew 26:33 Peter answered and said to him: Though all shall be offended at thee, yet will I never be offended.
Matthew 26:34 Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, This night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.
Matthew 26:35 Peter said to him: Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee. In like manner said all the disciples. <div eID="gen198" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen199" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples: Sit here, till I go and pray yonder.
Matthew 26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be in deep distress and anguish of soul.
Matthew 26:38 Then Jesus said to them: My soul is encompassed with sorrow even to death; remain here, and watch with me.
Matthew 26:39 And he went forward a little, and fell on his face in prayer, saying: My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou willest.
Matthew 26:40 And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter: Was it so, that you had not strength to watch with me one hour?
Matthew 26:41 Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is, willing, but the flesh is weak. <div eID="gen199" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen200" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:42 Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed, saying: My Father, if this cup cannot pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.
Matthew 26:43 And he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew 26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
Matthew 26:45 Then he came to his disciples, and said to them: Bleep what time is left, and take your rest; behold, the hour draws near, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
Matthew 26:46 Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up is at hand. <div eID="gen200" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen201" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:47 And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Matthew 26:48 He that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying: The one that I shall kiss is he; hold him fast.
Matthew 26:49 And immediately he came to Jesus, and said: Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
Matthew 26:50 Jesus said to him: Friend, for what purpose have you come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him fast. <div eID="gen201" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen202" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.
Matthew 26:52 Then Jesus said to him: Put back your sword into its place; for all that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.
Matthew 26:53 Do you think that I can not now call upon my Father, and he would cause more than twelve legions of angels to stand by me?
Matthew 26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? <div eID="gen202" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen203" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:55 At the same time Jesus said to the multitudes: Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I sat daily with you in the temple and taught, and you did not take me.
Matthew 26:56 All this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. <div eID="gen203" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen204" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:57 And those who took Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders had come together.
Matthew 26:58 But Peter followed him, at a distance, to the palace of the chief priest, and went in and sat with the attendants, to see the end.
Matthew 26:59 And the chief priests and the elders, and the whole Sanhedrin, sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death,
Matthew 26:60 and found none. Though many false witnesses came, yet they found none. At last two false witnesses came,
Matthew 26:61 and said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
Matthew 26:62 And the chief priest arose, and said to him: Do you make no answer? What do these testify against you?
Matthew 26:63 But Jesus remained silent. <div eID="gen204" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen205" type="x-p"/> And the chief priest answered and said to him: I adjure you, by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God?
Matthew 26:64 Jesus said to him: You have said. Moreover, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.
Matthew 26:65 Then the chief priest rent his clothes, and said: He has spoken impiously; what further need have we of witnesses? See now, you have heard his impious words:
Matthew 26:66 What think you? They answered and said: He is a subject for death.
Matthew 26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and strike him with their fists; some struck him with the open hand,
Matthew 26:68 and said: Give a response to us, Christ: Who is he that struck you? <div eID="gen205" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen206" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 26:69 But Peter was sitting without in the court; and a maid-servant came to him, and said: You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
Matthew 26:70 But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what you say.
Matthew 26:71 And when he went out into the entrance, another maid-servant saw him, and said to those who were there: This man was also with Jesus the Nazarene.
Matthew 26:72 And again he denied, with an oath: I know not the man.
Matthew 26:73 After a little while, those who stood by came and said to Peter: Of a truth you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.
Matthew 26:74 Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
Matthew 26:75 And Peter remembered the word which. Jesus had spoken to him: Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly.  <chapter eID="Matt.26"/> <div eID="gen206" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 27:1 When the morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people held a consultation against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
Matthew 27:2 And they bound him and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. <div eID="gen207" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen208" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:3 Then Judas, who had delivered him up, when he saw that he was condemned, stung by remorse, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Matthew 27:4 saying: I have sinned in having delivered up innocent blood. They replied: What is that to us? You will see to that.
Matthew 27:5 And he threw down the money in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
Matthew 27:6 And the chief priests took the money, and said: It is not lawful to put it into the sacred treasury, because it is the price of blood.
Matthew 27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with it the potter’s field, as a burial-place for foreigners.
Matthew 27:8 For this reason, that field is called the field of blood, to this day.
Matthew 27:9 Then the word was fulfilled which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that had a price set upon him, on whom some of the children of Israel did set a price,
Matthew 27:10 and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me. <div eID="gen208" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen209" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus replied to him: You say it.
Matthew 27:12 And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.
Matthew 27:13 Then Pilate said to him: Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?
Matthew 27:14 And he gave him answer to not one word, so that the governor was greatly astonished. <div eID="gen209" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen210" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:15 Now at the feast, the governor was in the habit of releasing to the multitude one prisoner, whom they chose.
Matthew 27:16 They then had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew 27:17 Therefore, while they were together, Pilate said to them: Which do you wish me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?
Matthew 27:18 For he knew that through envy they had delivered him up. <div eID="gen210" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen211" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:19 While he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered much to-day in a dream, because of him. <div eID="gen211" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen212" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude to ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
Matthew 27:21 The governor answered and said to them: Which of the two do you wish me to release to you? They replied: Barabbas.
Matthew 27:22 Pilate said to them: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said to him: Let him be crucified.
Matthew 27:23 But the governor said: Why, what evil has he done? But they cried vehemently, saying: Let him be crucified.
Matthew 27:24 When Pilate saw that he gained nothing, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, and said: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; you will see to it.
Matthew 27:25 And all the people answered and said: His blood be upon us and upon our children.
Matthew 27:26 Then he released to them Barabbas; but after he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified. <div eID="gen212" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen213" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the palace, and brought together to him the whole band.
Matthew 27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet cloak;
Matthew 27:29 and when they had plaited a crown of thorn branches, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and kneeling before him, they derided him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews!
Matthew 27:30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head.
Matthew 27:31 And when they had derided him, they took off the cloak from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. <div eID="gen213" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen214" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:32 And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: this man they compelled to carry his cross.
Matthew 27:33 And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, which, when translated, is the place of a skull,
Matthew 27:34 they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall; and when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.
Matthew 27:35 And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among themselves, by casting the lot.
Matthew 27:36 And they sat down and watched him there.
Matthew 27:37 And they placed above his head the charge that was made against him, written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew 27:38 Then were two robbers crucified with him; one on his right hand, and the other on his left. <div eID="gen214" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen215" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,
Matthew 27:40 and saying: You that destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Matthew 27:41 In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, derided him, and said:
Matthew 27:42 He saved others; himself he can not save. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.
Matthew 27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he delights in him; for he said: I am the Son of God.
Matthew 27:44 The robbers also that were crucified with him, uttered the same reproaches against him. <div eID="gen215" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen216" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:45 From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land till the ninth hour.
Matthew 27:46 But about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamah sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Matthew 27:47 Some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said: This man calls for Elijah.
Matthew 27:48 And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
Matthew 27:49 The rest said: Wait, let us see if Elijah is coming to save him. <div eID="gen216" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen217" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:50 And Jesus again cried with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
Matthew 27:51 And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom. And the earth did shake, and the rocks were rent:
Matthew 27:52 and the sepulchers were opened, and many bodies of the saints that slept, arose.
Matthew 27:53 And they came out of their sepulchers after his resurrection, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many. <div eID="gen217" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen218" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:54 Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and what was done, were greatly afraid, and said: Of a truth, this was the Son of God. <div eID="gen218" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen219" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:55 Many women that had followed Jesus from Galilee, and had ministered to him, were there, looking on from a distance.
Matthew 27:56 Among these was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. <div eID="gen219" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen220" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:57 When the evening had come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph; and he also was a disciple of Jesus.
Matthew 27:58 This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.
Matthew 27:59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen,
Matthew 27:60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
Matthew 27:61 And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <div eID="gen220" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen221" type="x-p"/>
Matthew 27:62 On the morrow, which was the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,
Matthew 27:63 and said: Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will arise.
Matthew 27:64 Therefore, command that the sepulcher be made safe till the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead; and the last error will be worse than the first.
Matthew 27:65 Pilate said to them: You have a guard; go, make it as safe as you know how.
Matthew 27:66 And they went and made the sepulcher safe, by placing a seal upon the stone, and setting the guard.  <chapter eID="Matt.27"/> <div eID="gen221" type="x-p"/>

Matthew 28:2 And behold, there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord having descended from heaven, came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
Matthew 28:3 His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment was white as snow.
Matthew 28:4 From fear of him the keepers did shake and become like dead men.
Matthew 28:5 But the angel answered and said to the women: Fear not; for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified.
Matthew 28:6 He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

Matthew 28:13 saying: Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep.
Matthew 28:14 And if this shall be heard in the presence of the governor, we will persuade him, and make you secure.

Mark 1:35 And very early in the morning, while it was yet dark, he arose and went out, and departed to a desert place, and there prayed.
Mark 1:36 And Simon, and those who were with him, followed after him.
Mark 1:37 And when they had found him, they said to him: All are seeking for thee.
Mark 1:38 And he said to them: Let us go into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also; for I have come forth for this purpose.
Mark 1:39 And throughout the whole of Galilee he continued to preach in their synagogues, and to cast out demons. <div eID="gen235" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen236" type="x-p"/>
Mark 1:40 And there came to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Mark 1:41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him: I will; be clean.
Mark 1:42 And when he had spoken, the leprosy immediately departed from him, and he was cleansed.
Mark 1:43 And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away,
Mark 1:44 and said to him: See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
Mark 1:45 But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to publish the matter abroad, so that he was no longer able to enter a city openly, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.  <chapter eID="Mark.1"/> <div eID="gen236" type="x-p"/>

Mark 2:1 And again he entered Capernaum, after some days; and they heard that he was in the house.
Mark 2:2 And immediately many came together, so that the house could contain them no longer, nor could the space about the door. And he preached the word to them. <div eID="gen237" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen238" type="x-p"/>
Mark 2:3 And they came to him, bringing a paralytic, who was carried by four men.
Mark 2:4 And not being able to come near him, on account of the multitude, they took off the roof where he was, and having broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
Mark 2:5 And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic: Son, your sins are forgiven you.
Mark 2:6 But some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts:
Mark 2:7 Why does this man thus speak impiously? Who can forgive sins but God only?
Mark 2:8 And Jesus, immediately perceiving in his spirit that they thus reasoned within themselves, said to them: Why are you reasoning thus in your hearts?
Mark 2:9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, take up your bed and walk?
Mark 2:10 But that you may know that the Son of man on earth has authority to forgive sins, (he said to the paralytic,)
Mark 2:11 I say to you, Arise, take up your bed and go to your house.
Mark 2:12 And he arose forthwith, and took up his bed, and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying: We have never seen it thus. <div eID="gen238" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen239" type="x-p"/>
Mark 2:13 And he went out again by the sea: and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
Mark 2:14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphæus sitting at the custom-house; and he said to him: Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
Mark 2:15 And it came to pass, as Jesus reclined at table in his house, that many publicans and sinners reclined with him and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him.
Mark 2:16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples: Why is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?
Mark 2:17 And when Jesus heard it, he said to them: Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners. <div eID="gen239" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen240" type="x-p"/>
Mark 2:18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were in the habit of fasting; and they came, and said to him: Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?
Mark 2:19 And Jesus said to them: Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can not fast.
Mark 2:20 But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.
Mark 2:21 No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment; if so, the new piece which fills it up, takes from the old, and a worse rent is made.
Mark 2:22 And no one puts new wine into old bottles; if so, the new wine bursts the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are destroyed. But new wine must be put into new bottles. <div eID="gen240" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen241" type="x-p"/>
Mark 2:23 And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath-day through the fields of grain: and his disciples began, as they went, to pull the ears of grain.
Mark 2:24 And the Pharisees said to him: See, why are they doing on the sabbath-day what is not lawful?
Mark 2:25 And he said to them: Did you never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he and those who were with him?
Mark 2:26 How he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the chief priest, and ate the loaves of the presence, which, it is not lawful, except for the priests, to eat, and gave to those also who were with him?
Mark 2:27 And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.
Mark 2:28 Therefore, the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.  <chapter eID="Mark.2"/> <div eID="gen241" type="x-p"/>

Mark 3:1 And again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
Mark 3:2 And they watched him, whether he would cure him on the sabbath-day, that they might accuse him.
Mark 3:3 And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Arise, and come into the midst.
Mark 3:4 And he said to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-day, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they were silent.
Mark 3:5 And looking around on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their heart, he said to the man: Stretch forth your hand; and he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored.
Mark 3:6 And the Pharisees immediately went out with the Herodians, and held a consultation against him, that they might destroy him. <div eID="gen242" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen243" type="x-p"/>
Mark 3:7 And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and there followed him a great multitude from Galilee, and from Judea,
Mark 3:8 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan: and those about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what things he was doing, came to him.
Mark 3:9 And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should continue near him, because of the multitude, that they might not press upon him.
Mark 3:10 For he cured many, so that as many as had diseases rushed upon him, that they might touch him.
Mark 3:11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying: Thou art the Son of God.
Mark 3:12 And he strictly charged them, that they should not make him known. <div eID="gen243" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen244" type="x-p"/>
Mark 3:13 And he went up into a mountain, and called to him such as he wished, and they came to him.
Mark 3:14 And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
Mark 3:15 and to have authority to cure diseases, and to cast out demons.
Mark 3:16 And Simon he surnamed Peter;
Mark 3:17 and James the sou of Zebedee, and John the brother of James: and these he surnamed Boanerges, which means, sons of thunder:
Mark 3:18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the Son of Alphæus, and Thaddæus, and Simon the Canaanite,
Mark 3:19 and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up. <div eID="gen244" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen245" type="x-p"/> And they went into a house:
Mark 3:20 and the multitude came together again, so that they were not able even to eat bread.
Mark 3:21 And when his relatives heard of it, they came out to take him; for they said: He is beside himself.
Mark 3:22 And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said: He has Beelzebul; and by the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
Mark 3:23 And he called them to him, and spoke to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark 3:24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom can not stand.
Mark 3:25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house can not stand. <div eID="gen245" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen246" type="x-p"/>
Mark 3:26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he can not stand, but has an end.
Mark 3:27 No one can enter the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.
Mark 3:28 Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever impious speeches they may utter;
Mark 3:29 but whoever will speak impiously against the Holy Spirit shall never have forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.
Mark 3:30 For they said: He has an unclean spirit. <div eID="gen246" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen247" type="x-p"/>

Mark 3:33 And he answered them and said: Who is my mother, or my brothers?
Mark 3:34 And he looked round about on those who were sitting near him, and said: Behold, my mother and my brothers;
Mark 3:35 for whoever will do the will of God, is my brother, and my sister, and mother.  <chapter eID="Mark.3"/> <div eID="gen247" type="x-p"/>

Mark 4:1 And again he began to teach by the sea; and a great multitude came together to him, so that he went into a ship, and sat in the sea: and the whole multitude was on the land near the sea.
Mark 4:2 And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching:
Mark 4:3 Hear; Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
Mark 4:4 and it came to pass, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside, and the birds came and ate it up.
Mark 4:5 Other seed fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth: and it immediately sprung up, because it had no depth of earth.
Mark 4:6 And when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Mark 4:7 And other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it produced no fruit.
Mark 4:8 And other seed fell in the good ground, and produced fruit that grew up and increased, and produced, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundred.
Mark 4:9 And he said: He that has ears to hear, let him hear. <div eID="gen248" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen249" type="x-p"/>
Mark 4:10 And when he was alone, those who were about him, with the twelve, asked him the meaning of the parable.
Mark 4:11 And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are without, all things are done in parables;
Mark 4:12 that they may surely see, and not perceive; and that they may surely hear, and not understand; lest they should turn to me, and their sins should be forgiven them.
Mark 4:13 And he said to them: Do you not understand this parable? And how then will you understand all parables?
Mark 4:14 The sower sows the word.
Mark 4:15 These are they that received seed by the wayside, where the word is sown; and when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
Mark 4:16 And these are they that, in like manner, received seed in stony places: who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy:
Mark 4:17 and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a time; afterward, when affliction or persecution arises on account of the word, they immediately take offense.
Mark 4:18 And these are they that received seed among thorns; who hear the word,
Mark 4:19 and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Mark 4:20 And these are they that received seed on the good ground; who hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred. <div eID="gen249" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen250" type="x-p"/>
Mark 4:21 And he said to them: Is a lamp brought in that it may be put under the measure, or under the divan? Is it not brought that it may be put on the lamp-stand?
Mark 4:22 For there is nothing hid that shall not be made known; nor has any thing been concealed, but that it may come into open view.
Mark 4:23 If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark 4:24 And he said to them: Take heed how you hear; with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you; and to you that hear, more shall be given;
Mark 4:25 for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him. <div eID="gen250" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen251" type="x-p"/>
Mark 4:26 And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should sow seed in the ground,
Mark 4:27 and should sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knows not how.
Mark 4:28 For the earth, of its own accord, produces fruit, first the blade; then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
Mark 4:29 But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest is ready. <div eID="gen251" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen252" type="x-p"/>
Mark 4:30 And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or, by what similitude shall we illustrate it?
Mark 4:31 It is like a grain of mustard, which, when it is sown in the ground, is less than all seeds that are in the ground;
Mark 4:32 yet, when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes larger than all garden-plants, and sends out great branches, so that the birds of the air can roost under its shadow. <div eID="gen252" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen253" type="x-p"/>
Mark 4:33 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.
Mark 4:34 But without a parable he did not speak to them; but when alone, he explained all things to his disciples. <div eID="gen253" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen254" type="x-p"/>
Mark 4:35 And on the same day, when it was evening, he said to them: Let us go over to the opposite side.
Mark 4:36 And when they had sent the multitude away, they took him with them, as he was in the ship; and there were other little ships with him.
Mark 4:37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves dashed into the ship, so that it was now full.
Mark 4:38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on the pillow. And they awoke him, and said to him: Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
Mark 4:39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
Mark 4:40 And he said to them: Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?
Mark 4:41 And they were greatly afraid, and said one to another: Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?  <chapter eID="Mark.4"/> <div eID="gen254" type="x-p"/>

Mark 5:1 And they came to the opposite side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
Mark 5:2 And when he had come out of the ship, immediately there met him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
Mark 5:3 who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could keep him bound even with chains;
Mark 5:4 because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been pulled to pieces by him, and the fetters had been broken, and no one had strength to subdue him;
Mark 5:5 and always, night and day, he was in the tombs, and in the mountains, crying out, and cutting himself with stones. <div eID="gen255" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen256" type="x-p"/>
Mark 5:6 And when he saw Jesus at a distance, he ran and did him homage;
Mark 5:7 and crying out with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
Mark 5:8 For he had said to him: Unclean spirit, come out of the man.
Mark 5:9 And he asked him: What is your name? And he said to him: My name is Legion; for we are many.
Mark 5:10 And he earnestly besought him that he would not send them out of the country. <div eID="gen256" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen257" type="x-p"/>
Mark 5:11 Now a great herd of swine was feeding there near the mountain.
Mark 5:12 And the demons besought him, saying: Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.
Mark 5:13 And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the swine; and the herd (they were about two thousand,) rushed down a steep place into the sea, and were strangled in the sea.
Mark 5:14 And those who fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came out to see what had been done;
Mark 5:15 and they came to Jesus and saw the demoniac, who had had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. <div eID="gen257" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen258" type="x-p"/>
Mark 5:16 And those who had seen it told them how it had happened to the demoniac, and also concerning the swine.
Mark 5:17 And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.
Mark 5:18 And when he had entered the ship, he that had been possessed with the demons besought him that he might be with him.
Mark 5:19 And he did not permit him, but said to him: Go home to your relatives, and make known to them what things the Lord has done for you, and that he has had compassion on you.
Mark 5:20 And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what things Jesus had done for him. And all were astonished. <div eID="gen258" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen259" type="x-p"/>
Mark 5:21 And when Jesus had again gone over in the ship to the opposite side, a great multitude came together to him; and he was near the sea.
Mark 5:22 And behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
Mark 5:23 and besought him earnestly, saying: My little daughter is at the point of death; come, lay thy hands on her, that she may be saved, and she will live.
Mark 5:24 And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and pressed upon him. <div eID="gen259" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen260" type="x-p"/>
Mark 5:25 And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood for twelve years,
Mark 5:26 and had suffered much from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was in no way benefited, but rather grew worse,
Mark 5:27 when she heard of Jesus, came behind him in the multitude, and touched his mantle;
Mark 5:28 for she said: If I may even touch his clothes, I shall be saved.
Mark 5:29 And immediately the fountain of her blood dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured of that plague.
Mark 5:30 And Jesus, immediately perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, turned around in the multitude and said: Who touched my clothes?
Mark 5:31 And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude pressing upon thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?
Mark 5:32 And he looked around to see her that had done this.
Mark 5:33 But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing; what had been done within her, came and fell down before him; and told him all the truth.
Mark 5:34 And he said to her: Daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace, and be cured of your plague. <div eID="gen260" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen261" type="x-p"/>
Mark 5:35 While he was yet speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue, who said: Your daughter is dead; why give the Teacher further trouble?
Mark 5:36 But as soon as Jesus heard what was spoken, he said to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not, only believe.
Mark 5:37 And he suffered no one to follow him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
Mark 5:38 And he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw the tumult, and those who were weeping and wailing greatly.
Mark 5:39 And he went in and said to them: Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeps.
Mark 5:40 And they derided him. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and mother of the child, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
Mark 5:41 And he took the child by the hand, and said to her: Talitha kumi; which is, when translated, Maiden, (I say to you,) arise.
Mark 5:42 And the maiden immediately arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were greatly astonished.
Mark 5:43 And he charged them strictly that no one should know this. And he commanded that something should be given her to eat.  <chapter eID="Mark.5"/> <div eID="gen261" type="x-p"/>

Mark 6:1 And he departed thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples followed him.
Mark 6:2 And when the sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many that heard him were astonished, and said: Whence has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty deeds are done by his hands?
Mark 6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and Judah and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they found in him cause for offense.
Mark 6:4 But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, unless in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.
Mark 6:5 And he was unable to do any mighty deed there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick persons and cured them;
Mark 6:6 and he wondered at their unbelief. <div eID="gen262" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen263" type="x-p"/> And he went to the villages round about, and taught.
Mark 6:7 And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out, two and two, and gave them authority over unclean spirits.
Mark 6:8 And he commanded them to take nothing for their journey, but a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in their purses;
Mark 6:9 but to be shod with sandals, and not to put on two coats.
Mark 6:10 And he said to them: Wherever you enter a house, there make your home till you depart from that place.
Mark 6:11 And whoever will not receive you, nor hear you, when you go out from that place, shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.

Mark 6:18 For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.
Mark 6:19 And Herodias was angry with him, and desired to have him killed, and was not able;

Mark 6:26 And the king was very sad; yet, on account of his oath and his guests, he would not reject her.
Mark 6:27 And the king immediately sent one of his guards, and commanded his head to be brought.
Mark 6:28 And he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the maiden; and the maiden gave it to her mother.

Mark 6:37 He answered and said to them: Do you give them food. And they said to him: Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii<index index="Glossary" level1="DENARIUS"/> worth of bread, and give them food?
Mark 6:38 He said to them: How many loaves have you? Go and see. And when they had learned, they said: Five, and two fishes.
Mark 6:39 And he commanded them to make all recline in table parties upon the green grass.
Mark 6:40 And they reclined in oblong squares, by hundreds, and by fifties.
Mark 6:41 And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed; and he broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to place before them. And he divided the two fishes among them all.
Mark 6:42 And they all ate, and were satisfied;
Mark 6:43 and they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces, and of the fishes.
Mark 6:44 And those who ate of the loaves were about five thousand men. <div eID="gen270" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen271" type="x-p"/>
Mark 6:45 And he immediately compelled his disciples to get into the ship, and to go before him to the opposite side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the multitude away.
Mark 6:46 And when he had sent them away, he went into the mountain to pray. <div eID="gen271" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen272" type="x-p"/>
Mark 6:47 And when evening came, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land.
Mark 6:48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea, and intended to pass by them.
Mark 6:49 But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a specter, and cried out;
Mark 6:50 for they all saw him, and were troubled. And he immediately spoke to them, and said: Take courage; it is I; be not afraid.
Mark 6:51 And he went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered;
Mark 6:52 for they had learned nothing from the loaves: for their heart was hardened. <div eID="gen272" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen273" type="x-p"/>
Mark 6:53 And when they had passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and drew the ship ashore.
Mark 6:54 And when they had come out of the ship, the people immediately recognized him,
Mark 6:55 and ran through the whole of that region round about, and began to carry the sick on beds, wherever they heard that he was.
Mark 6:56 And whatever place he entered, whether villages or cities or country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch even the fringe of his mantle: and as many as touched him were saved.  <chapter eID="Mark.6"/> <div eID="gen273" type="x-p"/>

Mark 7:1 And there came together to him the Pharisees, and some of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem:
Mark 7:2 and when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands:
Mark 7:3 (for the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not, unless they wash their hands carefully, because they hold the tradition of the elders:
Mark 7:4 and when they come from the market, they do not eat, unless they immerse themselves. And there are many other things, which they have received to hold, as the immersion of cups and pitchers and brazen vessels and beds:)
Mark 7:5 then the Pharisees and the scribes asked him: Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
Mark 7:6 He answered and said to them: Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Mark 7:7 In vain do they worship me, teaching precepts, the commandments of men.
Mark 7:8 For, neglecting the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the immersion of pitchers and cups; and many other things like these you do. <div eID="gen274" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen275" type="x-p"/>
Mark 7:9 And he said to them: Well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.
Mark 7:10 For Moses said: Honor your father and your mother; and, He that curses father or mother shall surely be put to death.
Mark 7:11 But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Whatever of mine might benefit you, is Corban, (which means, a gift,)
Mark 7:12 you no longer suffer him to do any thing for his father or mother,
Mark 7:13 making the word of God of no effect by your tradition, which you have delivered; and many things like these you do. <div eID="gen275" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen276" type="x-p"/>
Mark 7:14 And he called the whole multitude to him, and said to them: Hear me, all of you, and understand.
Mark 7:15 There is nothing without that, by entering into a man, can defile him. But those things which come out of the man, defile him.
Mark 7:16 If any one has ears to hear, let him hear. <div eID="gen276" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen277" type="x-p"/>
Mark 7:17 And when he had gone into the house, away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the dark saying.
Mark 7:18 And he said to them: Are you also so void of understanding? Do you not perceive that nothing from without, by entering into a man, can defile him?
Mark 7:19 Because it does not enter into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the sink, cleansing all food.
Mark 7:20 And he said: What comes out of the man, is that which defiles the man.
Mark 7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the purposes which are evil: adulteries, lewd actions, murders,
Mark 7:22 thefts, schemes for extortion, wicked deeds, deceit, wantonness, an evil eye, calumny, haughtiness, impiety.
Mark 7:23 All these evil things come forth from within, and defile the man. <div eID="gen277" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen278" type="x-p"/>
Mark 7:24 And he arose and departed thence to the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and desired that no one should know it; but he could not escape notice.
Mark 7:25 For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet;
Mark 7:26 (the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation,) and she besought him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
Mark 7:27 But Jesus said to her: Let the children be satisfied first; for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.
Mark 7:28 She answered and said to him: Yes, Lord; and <transChange type="added">yet you can help me,</transChange> for the little dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
Mark 7:29 And he said to her: For this saying, go your way: the demon has gone out of your daughter.
Mark 7:30 And she went to her house, and found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying upon the bed. <div eID="gen278" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen279" type="x-p"/>
Mark 7:31 And again he went out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
Mark 7:32 And they brought to him a deaf man, who spoke with difficulty; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him.
Mark 7:33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
Mark 7:34 and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him: Ephphatha, which means, Be opened.
Mark 7:35 And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.
Mark 7:36 And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more earnestly they published it.
Mark 7:37 And they were amazed beyond measure, and said: He Las done all things well: he makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.  <chapter eID="Mark.7"/> <div eID="gen279" type="x-p"/>

Mark 8:1 In those days, the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them:
Mark 8:2 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.
Mark 8:3 And if I send them home fasting, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar.
Mark 8:4 And his disciples answered him: Whence will any one be able to satisfy these men with bread, here in the wilderness?
Mark 8:5 And he asked them: How many loaves have you? And they said: Seven.
Mark 8:6 And he commanded the multitude to recline on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before them: and they set them before the multitude.
Mark 8:7 And they had a few small fishes; and he blessed, and commanded that they also be set before them.
Mark 8:8 And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up what remained of the broken pieces, seven baskets.
Mark 8:9 And those who had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away. <div eID="gen280" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen281" type="x-p"/>
Mark 8:10 And he immediately entered the ship with his disciples, and went into the regions of Dalmanutha.
Mark 8:11 And the Pharisees came out, and began to put questions to him, asking of him a sign from heaven, that they might tempt him.
Mark 8:12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said: Why does this generation seek for a sign? Verily I say to you, No sign will be given to this generation.
Mark 8:13 And he left them, and entered the ship again, and departed to the opposite side. <div eID="gen281" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen282" type="x-p"/>
Mark 8:14 And they had forgotten to take bread; and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.
Mark 8:15 And he charged them, saying: Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
Mark 8:16 And they reasoned with one another, saying: It is because we have no bread.
Mark 8:17 And Jesus perceived it, and said to them: Why do you reason, because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive, nor understand? Is your heart still hardened?
Mark 8:18 Having eyes, do you not see? and having ears, do you not hear? and do you not remember?
Mark 8:19 When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to him: Twelve.
Mark 8:20 When I broke the seven among the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They replied: Seven.
Mark 8:21 And he said to them: How is it that you do not understand? <div eID="gen282" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen283" type="x-p"/>
Mark 8:22 And he came to Bethsaida; and they brought to him a blind man, and besought him to touch him.
Mark 8:23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village. And he spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, and asked him if he saw any thing.
Mark 8:24 And he looked up and said: I see men, like trees, walking.
Mark 8:25 Then he again laid his hands on his eyes, and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw all things clearly.
Mark 8:26 And he sent him away to his house, and said: Neither go into the village, nor tell it to any one in the village. <div eID="gen283" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen284" type="x-p"/>
Mark 8:27 And Jesus and his disciples went out into the villages of Cæsarea Philippi. And on the road, he asked his disciples, saying to them: Who do men say that I am?
Mark 8:28 They answered: John the Immerser; and others, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.
Mark 8:29 And he said to them: But who say you that I am? Peter answered and said to him: Thou art the Christ.
Mark 8:30 And he charged them to tell no one concerning him. <div eID="gen284" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen285" type="x-p"/>
Mark 8:31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days rise again.
Mark 8:32 And he spoke this saying plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
Mark 8:33 But he turned about, and, looking on his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying: Get behind me, adversary: for you are not thinking of the things of God, but of the things of men. <div eID="gen285" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen286" type="x-p"/>
Mark 8:34 And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them: Whoever determines to follow after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Mark 8:35 For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, shall save it.
Mark 8:36 For what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own life?
Mark 8:37 Or, what will a man give as a ransom for his life?
Mark 8:38 For whoever will be ashamed of me, and my words, in this sinful and adulterous generation, of him the Son of man also will be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.  <chapter eID="Mark.8"/> <div eID="gen286" type="x-p"/>

Mark 9:2 And after six days, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up alone into a high mountain apart; and he was transfigured before them;
Mark 9:3 and his raiment became shining, exceeding white like snow, as no fuller on earth could whiten them.
Mark 9:4 And there appeared to them Elijah, with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark 9:5 And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Mark 9:6 For he knew not what to say, for they were greatly afraid.
Mark 9:7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them; and a voice came from the cloud, This is my beloved Son; hear him.
Mark 9:8 And suddenly looking around, they no longer saw any one but Jesus only with themselves. <div eID="gen288" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen289" type="x-p"/>
Mark 9:9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, till the Son of man should rise from the dead.
Mark 9:10 And they kept the matter to themselves, inquiring of one another what the rising from the dead could mean.
Mark 9:11 And they asked him, saying: Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Mark 9:12 And he answered and said to them: Elijah comes first, and restores all things, and, as it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be despised, <transChange type="added">so Elijah is to suffer</transChange>.
Mark 9:13 But I say to you, that Elijah has already come, and they have clone to him what they wished: [as it is written of him.] <div eID="gen289" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen290" type="x-p"/>
Mark 9:14 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and scribes disputing with them.
Mark 9:15 And at once, all the multitude, on seeing him, were struck with awe, and ran to him and saluted him.
Mark 9:16 And he asked the scribes: Why are you disputing with, them?
Mark 9:17 And one of the multitude answered and said: Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a dumb spirit.
Mark 9:18 And wherever it seizes him, it throws him into convulsions; and he foams, and gnashes with his teeth, and pines away: and I spoke to your disciples to cast him out, and they were not able.
Mark 9:19 And he answered them, and said: O faithless generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.
Mark 9:20 And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, the spirit immediately threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled himself, foaming. <div eID="gen290" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen291" type="x-p"/>
Mark 9:21 And he asked his father: How long is it since this came upon him? He replied: From childhood.
Mark 9:22 And often it throws him into the fire, and into the water, to destroy him. But if you are able to do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
Mark 9:23 Jesus said to him: If you are able to believe, all things are possible to him that believes.
Mark 9:24 And immediately the father of the child cried out, and with tears said: Lord, I believe; help my unbelief.
Mark 9:25 When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to it: Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more.
Mark 9:26 And the spirit cried out, and threw him into strong convulsions, and came out of him; and he was like one dead, so that many said: He is dead.
Mark 9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up, and he arose. <div eID="gen291" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen292" type="x-p"/>
Mark 9:28 And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately: Why were we not able to cast it out?

Mark 9:30 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he wished no one to know it.
Mark 9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said to them: The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will put him to death; and after he is put to death, he will rise on the third day.
Mark 9:32 But they did not understand this saying, and they were afraid to question him. <div eID="gen293" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen294" type="x-p"/>
Mark 9:33 And he came into Capernaum; and when he was in the house, he asked them: What were you disputing about among yourselves along the road?
Mark 9:34 But they were silent. For they had been disputing with one another along the road which was greatest.
Mark 9:35 And he sat down and called the twelve, and said to them: If any one desires to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
Mark 9:36 And he took a little child, and placed it in the midst of them; and when he had taken it in his arms, he said to them:
Mark 9:37 Whoever will receive one of such children on my account, receives me; and whoever will receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me. <div eID="gen294" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen295" type="x-p"/>
Mark 9:38 And John answered him and said: Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and he does not follow us: and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.
Mark 9:39 But Jesus said: Forbid him not; for there is no one that will do a mighty deed in my name, and be able readily to speak evil of me.
Mark 9:40 For he that is not against us, is for us.
Mark 9:41 For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink on this account, because you are Christ’s, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward. <div eID="gen295" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen296" type="x-p"/>

Mark 9:44 where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark 9:45 And if your foot ensnare you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life lame, than having two feet to Be thrown into hell, into the fire that is not quenched,
Mark 9:46 where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark 9:47 And if your eye ensnare you, pull it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be thrown into hell-fire,

Mark 10:3 He answered and said to them: What commandment did Moses give you?
Mark 10:4 They replied: Moses permitted us to write a bill of divorce, and put her away.
Mark 10:5 And Jesus answered and said to them: On account of the hardness of your hearts, he wrote this commandment for you.
Mark 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.
Mark 10:7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife;
Mark 10:8 and the two shall be one flesh. So, then, they are no longer two, but one flesh.

Mark 10:15 Verily I say to you, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter into it.

Mark 10:19 You know the commandments, You shall not commit adultery; You shall not kill; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.
Mark 10:20 He answered and said to him: Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.
Mark 10:21 And Jesus, looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One thing you lack; go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
Mark 10:22 But becoming sad at that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. <div eID="gen301" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen302" type="x-p"/>

Mark 10:24 And his disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus, answering again, said to them: Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!
Mark 10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Mark 10:26 And they were astonished beyond measure, and said among themselves: Who, then, can be saved?

Mark 10:37 They said to him: Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy glory.
Mark 10:38 Jesus said to them: You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed?
Mark 10:39 They said to him: We are able. Jesus said to them: You shall drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be immersed with the immersion with which I am immersed.

Mark 10:46 And they came to Jericho: and as he was going out of Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimæus, the son of Timæus, was sitting on the roadside, begging.
Mark 10:47 And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!
Mark 10:48 And many rebuked him, that he should be silent. But he cried out yet the more: Son of David, have mercy on me!
Mark 10:49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, and said to him: Take courage; arise, he calls you.
Mark 10:50 And throwing away his mantle, he arose, and came to Jesus.
Mark 10:51 And Jesus answered and said to him: What do you wish me to do for you? The blind man said to him: Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.
Mark 10:52 And Jesus said to him: Go, your faith has saved you. And he immediately received his sight, and followed Jesus on the road.  <chapter eID="Mark.10"/> <div eID="gen307" type="x-p"/>

Mark 11:1 And when they drew near to Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
Mark 11:2 and said to them: Go into the village opposite you; and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Loose him and bring him.
Mark 11:3 And if any say to you: Why are you doing this? say that the Lord has need of him; and he will immediately send him hither.
Mark 11:4 And they went and found the colt tied near the door without, in the street. And they loosed him.
Mark 11:5 And some of those who were standing there, said to them: Why are you loosing the colt?
Mark 11:6 And they said to them as Jesus had commanded; and they gave them permission.
Mark 11:7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and put their mantles upon him, and he sat on him. <div eID="gen308" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen309" type="x-p"/>

Mark 11:12 And on the morrow, as they were coming from Bethany, he was hungry;
Mark 11:13 and he saw at a distance a fig-tree that had leaves; and he went, if perhaps he might find any thing on it. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the time for figs.

Mark 11:16 And he suffered no one to carry a vessel through the temple.
Mark 11:17 And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written, My house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of robbers.
Mark 11:18 And the scribes and the chief priests heard him; and they sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude were astonished at his teaching.

Mark 11:22 And Jesus answered and said to them: Have faith in God.
Mark 11:23 For, verily I say to you, that whoever will say to this mountain, Be removed, and be cast into the sea, and will not doubt in his heart, but believe that what he says will come to pass, he shall have whatever he says.

Mark 11:25 And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have any thing against any one, that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your offenses.

Mark 11:27 And they came again into Jerusalem; and as he was walking in the temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders,

Mark 11:29 And Jesus answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, and if you answer me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark 11:30 Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.
Mark 11:31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will reply, Why, then, did you not believe him?
Mark 11:32 But if we say, From men, they feared the people; for all regarded John as a prophet indeed.
Mark 11:33 And they answered and said to Jesus: We do not know. And Jesus answering, said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.  <chapter eID="Mark.11"/> <div eID="gen314" type="x-p"/>

Mark 12:1 And he began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and digged a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went into another country.
Mark 12:2 And at the proper time, he sent a servant to the vine-dressers, that he might receive from the vine-dressers of the fruit of the vineyard.
Mark 12:3 And they took him and scourged him, and sent him away without any thing.
Mark 12:4 And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they threw stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
Mark 12:5 And again he sent another; and him they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they scourged, and some they killed.
Mark 12:6 Therefore, having yet one son, his beloved, he sent him also to them last, saying, They will reverence my son.
Mark 12:7 But those vine-dressers said one to another, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
Mark 12:8 And they took him, and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
Mark 12:9 What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those vine-dressers, and give his vineyard to others.

Mark 12:13 And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might entrap him in his words.
Mark 12:14 And they came and said to him: Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you care for no one; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
Mark 12:15 Must we give, or must we not give? But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them: Why do you tempt me? Bring me a denarius<index index="Glossary" level1="DENARIUS"/>, that I may see it.
Mark 12:16 They brought it; and he said to them: Whose image and superscription is this? They said to him: Cæsar’s.

Mark 12:18 And the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him, and put a question to him, saying:
Mark 12:19 Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any man’s brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
Mark 12:20 Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying, left no child;
Mark 12:21 and the second took her, and he died, and left no child; and the third, likewise;
Mark 12:22 and the seven took her, and left no child. Last of all, the woman also died.
Mark 12:23 Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, of which of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her as a wife.
Mark 12:24 And Jesus answered and said to them: Do you not err for this reason, because you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
Mark 12:25 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.
Mark 12:26 But concerning the dead, that they do rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, at The Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
Mark 12:27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, you do greatly err. <div eID="gen318" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen319" type="x-p"/>
Mark 12:28 And one of the scribes came, and heard them reasoning together; and perceiving that he had answered them well, he asked him: Which is the first commandment of all?
Mark 12:29 And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
Mark 12:30 And you shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind, and with your whole strength. This is the first commandment.
Mark 12:31 And the second, which is like it, is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
Mark 12:32 And the scribe said to him: Teacher, in truth you have well said, that there is one God, and there is no other beside him;
Mark 12:33 and to love him with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, and with the whole soul, and with the whole strength, and to love one’s neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
Mark 12:34 And Jesus perceiving that he answered with understanding, said to him: You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one, after that, ventured to ask him a question. <div eID="gen319" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen320" type="x-p"/>
Mark 12:35 And Jesus, as he was teaching in the temple, answered and said: How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?
Mark 12:36 For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
Mark 12:37 David himself, then, calls him Lord; and how is he his son? And the great multitude heard him with pleasure. <div eID="gen320" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen321" type="x-p"/>

Mark 12:40 who eat up the houses of widows, and, as a pretext, make long prayers: these shall receive more abundant condemnation. <div eID="gen321" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen322" type="x-p"/>

Mark 13:7 But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled; for these things must be: but not yet is the end.
Mark 13:8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines, and tumults.
Mark 13:9 These are the beginning of sorrows. But take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be scourged in the synagogues; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.

Mark 14:62 Jesus replied: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
Mark 14:63 And the chief priest rent his clothes, and said: What further need have we of witnesses?
Mark 14:64 You have heard his impious speech. What think you? They all condemned him to be a subject of death. <div eID="gen343" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen344" type="x-p"/>

Mark 14:66 And while Peter was in the court below, one of the maidservants of the chief priest came;
Mark 14:67 and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said: You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.
Mark 14:68 But he denied, saying: I neither know, nor understand what you say. And he went out into the entrance, and the cock crew.
Mark 14:69 And the maid-servant saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by: This man is one of them.
Mark 14:70 He again denied. And again, after a little while, those who stood by said to Peter: Surely, you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech is like theirs.
Mark 14:71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying: I know not this man of whom you speak.
Mark 14:72 And immediately the cock crew the second time. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times. And when he thought upon it, he wept.  <chapter eID="Mark.14"/> <div eID="gen345" type="x-p"/>

Mark 15:1 And forthwith in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin, having held a consultation, and having bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
Mark 15:2 And Pilate asked him: Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering, said: You say it.
Mark 15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things.
Mark 15:4 Pilate again asked him, saying: Do you make no answer? See, how many things they testify against you.
Mark 15:5 But Jesus gave no further answer; so that Pilate was astonished. <div eID="gen346" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen347" type="x-p"/>
Mark 15:6 Now it was his custom to release to them, at the feast, one prisoner, whomever they desired.
Mark 15:7 And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with his fellow-insurgents, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark 15:8 And the multitude cried out, and began to ask him to do as he had always done for them.
Mark 15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying: Do you wish me to release to you the King of the Jews?
Mark 15:10 For he knew that, through envy, the chief priests had delivered him up.
Mark 15:11 But the chief priests instigated the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
Mark 15:12 And Pilate answered and said again to them: What, then, do you wish me to do with him whom you call the King of the Jews?
Mark 15:13 They again cried out: Crucify him.
Mark 15:14 But Pilate said to them: Why, what evil has he done? But they cried vehemently: Crucify him.
Mark 15:15 And Pilate, willing to gratify the multitude, released to them Barabbas; and delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be crucified. <div eID="gen347" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen348" type="x-p"/>

Mark 15:18 and began to salute him: Hail, King of the Jews!
Mark 15:19 And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and bowing their knees, did him homage.
Mark 15:20 And when they had derided him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. <div eID="gen348" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen349" type="x-p"/>
Mark 15:21 And they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian, (the father of Alexander and Rufus,) who was passing by, coming in from the country, to bear his cross.

Mark 15:23 And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh, to drink: but he did not receive it.
Mark 15:24 And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves, casting lots for them, what each one should take. <div eID="gen349" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen350" type="x-p"/>

Mark 15:27 And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

Mark 15:29 And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying: Aha! you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
Mark 15:30 save yourself, and come down from the cross.
Mark 15:31 Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes, speaking in derision one to another, said: He saved others; himself he can not save.
Mark 15:32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. Those also who were crucified with him, reproached him. <div eID="gen351" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen352" type="x-p"/>
Mark 15:33 And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land, till the ninth hour.

Mark 15:35 And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said: Behold, he calls for Elijah.
Mark 15:36 And one ran, and filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying: Wait; let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down. <div eID="gen352" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen353" type="x-p"/>

Mark 15:42 And when the evening had come, because it was the preparation, which is the eve of the sabbath,
Mark 15:43 Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who was himself looking for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark 15:44 But Pilate was astonished that he was already dead; and having called the centurion to him, he inquired of him whether he had been any while dead.
Mark 15:45 And having learned the fact from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
Mark 15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher that had been hewed out of a rock: and he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.

Mark 16:1 And when the sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Mark 16:2 And very early, on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they came to the sepulcher.
Mark 16:3 And they said among themselves: Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulcher?
Mark 16:4 for it was very great. And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away.
Mark 16:5 And they entered the sepulcher, and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe: and they were frightened.
Mark 16:6 But he said to them: Be not frightened; you seek Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here: see the place where they laid him.
Mark 16:7 But go, tell his disciples, and Peter, that he goes before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.
Mark 16:8 And they went out, and fled from the sepulcher; for trembling and astonishment seized upon them. And they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid. <div eID="gen356" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen357" type="x-p"/>
Mark 16:9 Now when Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.
Mark 16:10 And she went and told it to those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
Mark 16:11 And though they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they did not believe. <div eID="gen357" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen358" type="x-p"/>
Mark 16:12 After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked and went into the country.
Mark 16:13 And they went and told it to the rest. But they did not believe them.
Mark 16:14 Afterward he appeared to the eleven as they reclined at table; and he reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen. <div eID="gen358" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen359" type="x-p"/>

Luke 1:5 There was, in the days of Herod the king of Judea, a certain priest, named Zachariah, of the class of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
Luke 1:6 They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.

Luke 1:10 And all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.
Luke 1:11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. <div eID="gen364" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen365" type="x-p"/>
Luke 1:12 And Zachariah was troubled at the sight, and fear fell upon him.

Luke 1:14 And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
Luke 1:15 For he shall be great before the Lord; and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.

Luke 1:20 And behold, you shall be dumb and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because you did not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their proper time.

Luke 5:20 And when he saw their faith, he said to him: Man, your sins are forgiven you.

Luke 6:45 The good man, out of the good treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is good; and the evil man, out of the evil treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks. <div eID="gen428" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen429" type="x-p"/>
Luke 6:46 But why call me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I command?
Luke 6:47 Every one that comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.
Luke 6:48 He is like a man that, when building a house, digged deep, and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the torrent dashed against that house, and it was not able to shake it, for it was founded on the rock.
Luke 6:49 But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth, without a foundation, against which the torrent dashed with violence, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.  <chapter eID="Luke.6"/> <div eID="gen429" type="x-p"/>

Luke 7:1 And when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he went into Capernaum.
Luke 7:2 And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and about to die.
Luke 7:3 But when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, and besought him to come and save his servant.
Luke 7:4 And they came to Jesus, and besought him earnestly, saying: He is worthy for whom thou shouldst do this;
Luke 7:5 for he loves our nation, and of his own accord has built us a synagogue.
Luke 7:6 And Jesus went with them. <div eID="gen430" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen431" type="x-p"/> And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, and said to him: Lord, give thyself no trouble; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof.
Luke 7:7 For which reason, neither did I count myself worthy to go to thee; but command in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
Luke 7:8 For I am a man placed under authority, and have soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
Luke 7:9 And when Jesus heard these things, he was filled with admiration for him; and, turning to the multitude that followed, he said: I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith.
Luke 7:10 And they that had been sent, returned to the house, and found the servant that had been sick restored to health. <div eID="gen431" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen432" type="x-p"/>
Luke 7:11 And it came to pass, the next day, that he was going to a city called Nain; and many of his disciples and a great multitude followed him.
Luke 7:12 And when he came near the gate of tho city, behold, they were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude from the city was with her.
Luke 7:13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her: Weep not.
Luke 7:14 And he went and touched the bier; and those who were carrying it, stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to you, Arise.
Luke 7:15 And he that had been dead, sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.
Luke 7:16 And fear seized on all; and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet has arisen among us; and, God has visited his people.
Luke 7:17 And this report concerning him went abroad into all Judea and all the neighboring region. <div eID="gen432" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen433" type="x-p"/>
Luke 7:18 And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
Luke 7:19 And John called to him two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, and said: Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?
Luke 7:20 And the men came to him and said: John the Immerser has sent us to thee, and says, Art thou he that was to come, or must we look for another?
Luke 7:21 And in that very hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and bestowed sight on many that were blind.
Luke 7:22 And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them;
Luke 7:23 and blessed is he who shall find no cause of offense in me. <div eID="gen433" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen434" type="x-p"/>
Luke 7:24 And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
Luke 7:25 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear splendid apparel, and live in luxury, are in kings houses.
Luke 7:26 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
Luke 7:27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
Luke 7:28 For I say to you, Among those born of women, there is no prophet greater than John the Immerser. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Luke 7:29 And all the people, and the publicans that heard him, vindicated God, by being immersed with the immersion of John;
Luke 7:30 but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God in regard to themselves, by not being immersed by him.
Luke 7:31 To what, then, shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
Luke 7:32 They are like children sitting in the market-place, who call to one another, and say, We have played on the pipe for you, and you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs for you, and you have not lamented.
Luke 7:33 For John the Immerser came, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.
Luke 7:34 The Son of man has come, eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners.
Luke 7:35 Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children. <div eID="gen434" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen435" type="x-p"/>
Luke 7:36 And one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and reclined at table.
Luke 7:37 And, behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that he reclined at table in the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
Luke 7:38 and stood behind at his feet, weeping; and she began to wash his feet with her tears; and she wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
Luke 7:39 But when the Pharisee who had invited him, saw it, he said within himself: This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who, and what sort of woman this is that touches him; for she is a sinner. <div eID="gen435" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen436" type="x-p"/>

Luke 7:41 A certain creditor had two debtors; the one owed him five hundred denarii<index index="Glossary" level1="DENARIUS"/>, the other, fifty.
Luke 7:42 But as they had nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them, then, will love him the more?
Luke 7:43 Simon answered and said: I suppose he to whom he forgave the more. He said to him: You have decided correctly. <div eID="gen436" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen437" type="x-p"/>
Luke 7:44 And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon: Do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
Luke 7:45 You gave me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke 7:46 You did not anoint my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke 7:47 Wherefore, I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much. But he to whom little is forgiven, loves little.
Luke 7:48 And he said to her: Your sins are forgiven.
Luke 7:49 And those who reclined at table with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that also forgives sins?
Luke 7:50 But he said to the woman: Your faith has saved you; go in peace.  <chapter eID="Luke.7"/> <div eID="gen437" type="x-p"/>

Luke 8:1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went through every city and village, preaching, and making known the good news of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him;
Luke 8:2 and also certain women that had been cured of evil spirits and diseases; Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven demons,
Luke 8:3 and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him from their means. <div eID="gen438" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen439" type="x-p"/>
Luke 8:4 And when a great multitude had assembled, and they were coming to him from every city, he spoke by a parable:
Luke 8:5 The sower went forth to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air ate it up.
Luke 8:6 And some fell upon the rock; and when it had sprung up, it withered, because it had no moisture.
Luke 8:7 And some fell in the midst of thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.
Luke 8:8 And other seed fell into good ground, and sprung up, and produced fruit a hundred-fold. When he had said these things, he cried: He that has ears to hear, let him hear. <div eID="gen439" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen440" type="x-p"/>
Luke 8:9 And the disciples asked him, saying: What does this parable mean?
Luke 8:10 He replied: To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that when they see, they may not see, and when they hear, they may not understand.
Luke 8:11 But the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the word of God;
Luke 8:12 those by the wayside are they that hear; then comes the devil and takes the word from their heart, lest they should believe and be saved.
Luke 8:13 Those on the rock are they that, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who, for awhile, believe, and in time of temptation apostatize.
Luke 8:14 That which fell among thorns are those who hear, and so conduct themselves, that they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
Luke 8:15 But that on the good ground are those who, in a good and honest heart, hear the word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. <div eID="gen440" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen441" type="x-p"/>
Luke 8:16 No one when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a divan, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who come in may see the light.
Luke 8:17 For there is nothing concealed, that shall not be made manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known and brought into view.
Luke 8:18 Take heed, therefore, how you hear; for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, even that which he seems to have shall be taken from him. <div eID="gen441" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen442" type="x-p"/>
Luke 8:19 And his mother and his brothers came to him, but were not able to get near him on account of the multitude.

Luke 8:22 And it came to pass, on a certain day, that he entered a ship with his disciples; and he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they set sail.
Luke 8:23 And while they were sailing, he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down upon the lake, and they began to be filled, and were in danger.
Luke 8:24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying: Master, master, we perish. But he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luke 8:25 And he said to them: Where is your faith? And being afraid, they wondered, and said one to another: Who, then, is this, that he commands even the wind and the water, and they obey him? <div eID="gen443" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen444" type="x-p"/>
Luke 8:26 And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite to Galilee.
Luke 8:27 And when he came out upon the land, there met him a certain man from the city, who had been possessed with demons for a long time, and who wore no clothes, and dwelt in no house, but in the tombs.
Luke 8:28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, torment me not.
Luke 8:29 For he had O; commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized upon him, and he had been bound with chains and fetters, and kept in confinement; and he broke the bonds, and was driven by the demon into the deserts.
Luke 8:30 And Jesus asked him, saying: What is your name? He answered, Legion; for many demons had entered into him.
Luke 8:31 And they be sought him, that he would not command them to go away into the abyss. <div eID="gen444" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen445" type="x-p"/>
Luke 8:32 And there was in that place a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. And they besought him to permit them to go into them. And he permitted them.

Luke 8:34 And when those who fed them saw what was done, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
Luke 8:35 And they came out to see what had been done; and they came to Jesus, and saw the man out of whom the demons had gone, clothed, and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
Luke 8:36 And those who had seen it, told them by what means the man who had been possessed with the demons, was saved. <div eID="gen445" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen446" type="x-p"/>

Luke 8:41 And, behold, there came a man, whose name was Jairus; and he was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him to come into his house;
Luke 8:42 for he had a daughter, his only child, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And as he went, the multitude pressed upon him. <div eID="gen447" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen448" type="x-p"/>

Luke 8:45 And Jesus said: Who touched me? When they all denied, Peter and those with him said: Master, the multitudes press upon thee, and throng thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?
Luke 8:46 But Jesus said: Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.
Luke 8:47 And the woman, seeing that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and fell down before him, and told him, before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and that she was immediately restored to health.

Luke 8:51 And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to go in but Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the child.
Luke 8:52 And all were weeping and lamenting her. But he said: Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.
Luke 8:53 And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.
Luke 8:54 But he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, and said: Child, arise.
Luke 8:55 And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And he commanded that food should be given her.

Luke 9:3 And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; nor have two coats each.
Luke 9:4 And whatever house you enter, there remain, and thence depart.
Luke 9:5 And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off even the dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.

Luke 9:13 But he said to them: Do you give them food. They replied: We have nothing but five loaves and two fishes, unless we go and buy food for all these people.
Luke 9:14 For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Make them recline in companies of fifty.
Luke 9:15 And they did so, and made them all recline.
Luke 9:16 And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave them to the disciples, to set before the multitude.
Luke 9:17 And they all ate, and were satisfied; and there was taken up what remained to them of the broken pieces, twelve baskets. <div eID="gen453" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen454" type="x-p"/>

Luke 9:20 He said to them: But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said: The Christ of God.
Luke 9:21 And he strictly charged them and commanded them to tell this to no one,
Luke 9:22 saying: The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised the third day. <div eID="gen454" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen455" type="x-p"/>

Luke 9:25 For what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and destroy himself, or be lost?
Luke 9:26 For whoever will be ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in his own glory; and that of the Father, and of the holy angels.

Luke 9:34 While he was saying these things, there came a cloud, and it overshadowed them; and they were afraid as those men entered the cloud.
Luke 9:35 And there came a voice from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son; hear him.

Luke 9:39 and, behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it throws him into convulsions, and causes him to foam, and after depriving him of strength, hardly departs from him.
Luke 9:40 And I entreated thy disciples to cast it out; but they were not able.
Luke 9:41 And Jesus answering, said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you! Bring your son hither.
Luke 9:42 And while he was coming, the demon cast him to the ground, and threw him into convulsions; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and restored the child to health, and gave him back to his father.

Luke 9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was turned toward Jerusalem.
Luke 9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said: Lord, is it thy will that we command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, even as Elijah did?
Luke 9:55 But he turned and rebuked them, and said: You know not of what spirit you are.

Luke 9:59 And he said to another: Follow me. But he replied: Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.
Luke 9:60 Jesus said: Let the dead bury their own dead; but do you go and publish abroad the kingdom of God.

Luke 11:14 And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it came to pass, when the demon had gone out, that the dumb man spoke: and the multitudes wondered.
Luke 11:15 But some of them said: He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
Luke 11:16 And others, that they might tempt him, asked of him a sign from heaven.
Luke 11:17 But, knowing their purpose, he said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolation; and a house that is divided against a house, falls.
Luke 11:18 If Satan be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say, that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
Luke 11:19 But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they shall be your judges.

Luke 18:35 And it came to pass, that, as he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road begging.
Luke 18:36 And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
Luke 18:37 And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.
Luke 18:38 And he cried out and said: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
Luke 18:39 And those who went before rebuked him, that he should be silent. But he cried so much the more: Son of David, have mercy on me. <div eID="gen544" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen545" type="x-p"/>
Luke 18:40 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,
Luke 18:41 saying: What do you wish me to do for you? he replied: Lord, that I may receive my sight.
Luke 18:42 And Jesus said to him: Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.
Luke 18:43 And he immediately received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.  <chapter eID="Luke.18"/> <div eID="gen545" type="x-p"/>

Luke 19:1 And he entered, and passed through Jericho.
Luke 19:2 And, behold, there was a man called Zacchæus, who was a chief publican; and he was rich.
Luke 19:3 And he sought to see Jesus, who he was, and was not able on account of the multitude, because he was of small stature.
Luke 19:4 And he ran before, and climbed up a sycamore-tree, that he might see him, for he was about to pass that way.
Luke 19:5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him: Zacchæus, make haste and come down, for I must spend this day at your house.
Luke 19:6 And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. <div eID="gen546" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen547" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying: He has gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
Luke 19:8 And Zacchæus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken from any one by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.
Luke 19:9 And Jesus said to him: To-day has salvation come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.
Luke 19:10 For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. <div eID="gen547" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen548" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:11 And as they heard these things, he also spoke a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.
Luke 19:12 He said, therefore: A certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
Luke 19:13 And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, Engage in trade till I come.
Luke 19:14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. <div eID="gen548" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen549" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:15 And it came to pass, that, when he had returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded those servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what each had gained by trading.
Luke 19:16 And the first came and said: Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.
Luke 19:17 And he said to him: Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.
Luke 19:18 And the second came and said: Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.
Luke 19:19 And he said to him also: And be you over five cities.
Luke 19:20 And another came and said: Lord, behold your pound, which I have kept laid away in a napkin.
Luke 19:21 For I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man; you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow. <div eID="gen549" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen550" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:22 Then he said to him: Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow.
Luke 19:23 And why then did you not put my money into the bank, that, when I came, I could have collected it with interest?
Luke 19:24 And he said to those who stood by: Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.
Luke 19:25 And they said to him: Lord, he has ten pounds.
Luke 19:26 For I say to you, To every one that has, it shall be given; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away.
Luke 19:27 But those who are my enemies, who were not willing that I should rule over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
Luke 19:28 And when he had said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem. <div eID="gen550" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen551" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:29 And it came to pass, that, when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
Luke 19:30 saying: Go into the opposite village, in which, when you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Loose him, and bring him.
Luke 19:31 And if any one ask you why you loose him, thus shall you say to him: The Lord has need of him. <div eID="gen551" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen552" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:32 And those who were sent, went, and found as he had said to them.
Luke 19:33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of him said to them: Why do you loose the colt?
Luke 19:34 They replied: The Lord has need of him.
Luke 19:35 And they brought him to Jesus, and threw their mantles upon the colt, and set Jesus on him.
Luke 19:36 And as he was going on, they spread their mantles in the road.
Luke 19:37 And when he was now near the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God, with a loud voice, for all the mighty deeds which they had seen,
Luke 19:38 saying: Blessed is the king that comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
Luke 19:39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude, said to him: Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
Luke 19:40 And he answered, and said to them: I say to you, that if these had been silent, the stones would have cried out. <div eID="gen552" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen553" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:41 And when he came near, he looked upon the city, and wept over it,
Luke 19:42 saying: Hadst thou known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which were for thy peace! But now, they are hid from thy eyes.
Luke 19:43 For the days will come upon thee, when thy enemies will throw up a mound about thee, and inclose thee around, and keep thee in on every side,
Luke 19:44 and will destroy thee and thy children within thee, and will not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. <div eID="gen553" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen554" type="x-p"/>
Luke 19:45 And he went into the temple, and began to drive out those who were selling in it, and those who were buying,

Luke 20:1 And it came to pass, that, on one of those days, while he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came to him,
Luke 20:2 and spoke to him, saying: Tell us by what authority you do these things? or, who is he that gave you this authority?
Luke 20:3 And he answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, and do you answer me.
Luke 20:4 Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men?
Luke 20:5 And they reasoned among themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will reply: Why, then, did you not believe him?
Luke 20:6 But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they believe that John was a prophet.
Luke 20:7 And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.
Luke 20:8 And Jesus said to them: Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things. <div eID="gen556" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen557" type="x-p"/>
Luke 20:9 And he began to speak this parable to the people: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to vine-dressers, and was absent from home for a long time.
Luke 20:10 And at the proper season, he sent a servant to those vine-dressers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vine-dressers scourged him, and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke 20:11 And he then sent another servant. But they scourged him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke 20:12 And he also sent a third; but they wounded him, and drove him out. <div eID="gen557" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen558" type="x-p"/>
Luke 20:13 And the owner of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps, when they see him, they will reverence him.
Luke 20:14 But when the vine-dressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
Luke 20:15 And they drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
Luke 20:16 He will come and destroy these vine-dressers, and will give his vineyard to others. <div eID="gen558" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen559" type="x-p"/> And when they heard it, they said: Be it not so!
Luke 20:17 And he looked on them and said: What, then, does this mean, which is written, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?
Luke 20:18 Whoever shall fall on this stone, shall be dashed to pieces; but on whomever it shall fall, it will make him as chaff for the wind.
Luke 20:19 And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him, the same hour; (and yet they feared the people;) for they knew that he spoke this parable against them. <div eID="gen559" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen560" type="x-p"/>
Luke 20:20 And they watched him, and sent spies, who feigned them selves to be just men, that they might take hold of his words, in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.
Luke 20:21 And they asked him, saying: Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not regard the person of any, but teach the way of God in truth.
Luke 20:22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
Luke 20:23 But he perceived their cunning, and said to them: Why do you tempt me?
Luke 20:24 Show me a denarius<index index="Glossary" level1="DENARIUS"/>. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said: Cæsar’s.
Luke 20:25 He said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
Luke 20:26 And they were not able to take hold of his words before the people. And they were astonished at his answer, and were silent. <div eID="gen560" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen561" type="x-p"/>
Luke 20:27 Then there came to him some of the Sadducees, (these deny that there is any resurrection,) and asked him,
Luke 20:28 saying: Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
Luke 20:29 There were, therefore, seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children;
Luke 20:30 and the second took his wife, and he died without children;
Luke 20:31 and the third took her; and in like manner also the seven; and they left no children, and died.
Luke 20:32 Last of all, the woman also died.
Luke 20:33 Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her as a wife. <div eID="gen561" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen562" type="x-p"/>
Luke 20:34 And Jesus answered and said to them: The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
Luke 20:35 But those who shall be accounted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
Luke 20:36 For they can die no more; for they are like the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.
Luke 20:37 But: that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at The Bush, since he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Luke 20:38 He is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him.
Luke 20:39 And certain of the scribes answered and said: Teacher, thou hast answered well.

Luke 21:7 And they asked him, saying: Teacher, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when these things come to pass?
Luke 21:8 He replied: Take heed that you be not deceived; for many will come in my name, saying: I am he; and, The time is near. Go not, therefore, after them.
Luke 21:9 But when you hear of wars, and tumults, be not terrified; for these things must first take place; but the end comes not immediately.

Luke 21:14 Therefore, determine in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what you shall answer;

Luke 22:53 While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.
Luke 22:54 And they took him, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the chief priest. <div eID="gen584" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen585" type="x-p"/> But Peter followed at a distance.
Luke 22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
Luke 22:56 And a certain maid-servant saw him sitting by the fire; and, looking intently at him, she said: This man also was with him.
Luke 22:57 But he denied, saying: Woman, I know him not.
Luke 22:58 And after a little, another saw him, and said: You also are one of them. Peter replied: Man, I am not.
Luke 22:59 And about one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.
Luke 22:60 But Peter said: Man, I know not what you say. And immediately, while he was speaking, the cock crew.
Luke 22:61 And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, that he had said to him, Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.
Luke 22:62 And Peter went out and wept bitterly. <div eID="gen585" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen586" type="x-p"/>
Luke 22:63 And the men that had Jesus in custody mocked him, and smote him.
Luke 22:64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying: Give a response; who is it that struck you?
Luke 22:65 And many other impious things they said to him. <div eID="gen586" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen587" type="x-p"/>
Luke 22:66 And when it was day, the elders of the people, the chief priests also and scribes, met together, and led him up to the Sanhedrin, and said:
Luke 22:67 If you are the Christ, tell us. But he said to them: If I tell you, you will not believe;
Luke 22:68 and if I also ask you a question, you will not answer me, nor let me go.
Luke 22:69 Henceforth the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God.
Luke 22:70 And they all said: You are, then, the Son of God? He said to them: You say that I am.
Luke 22:71 They replied: What further need have we of testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.  <chapter eID="Luke.22"/> <div eID="gen587" type="x-p"/>

Luke 23:1 And the whole number of them arose, and led him away to Pilate.
Luke 23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying: We found this man turning the people away, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.
Luke 23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? He answered and said to him: You say it.
Luke 23:4 Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no fault in this man.
Luke 23:5 But they became the more urgent, and said: He excites the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
Luke 23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <div eID="gen588" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen589" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:7 And when he learned that he belonged to the dominion of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was at that time in Jerusalem.
Luke 23:8 When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly; for he had, for a long time, desired to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign done by him.
Luke 23:9 And he questioned him concerning many things; but he made him no answer.
Luke 23:10 And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, and vehemently accused him.
Luke 23:11 But Herod and his guards treated him with contempt; and having mocked him, and put on him a gaudy robe, he sent him back to Pilate.
Luke 23:12 And on the same day, Pilate and Herod became friends to each other; for, before this, they had been at enmity the one toward the other. <div eID="gen589" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen590" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:13 And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Luke 23:14 and said to them: You have brought to me this man as one that turns the people away; and behold, I have examined him before you, and have found in this man no fault, with respect to the things of which you accuse him;
Luke 23:15 nor indeed did Herod; for I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
Luke 23:16 I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him. <div eID="gen590" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen591" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:17 For it was necessary that he should release to them one at the feast.
Luke 23:18 And the whole multitude cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.
Luke 23:19 He, for a certain seditious movement that had been made in the city, and for murder, had been thrown into prison.
Luke 23:20 Therefore Pilate, desiring to release Jesus, again called to them.
Luke 23:21 But they answered, saying: Crucify, crucify him.
Luke 23:22 He said to them the third time: Why, what evil has he done? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him.
Luke 23:23 But they were urgent with loud voices, demanding that he should be crucified. And their voices, and those of the chief priests, prevailed.
Luke 23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they demanded.
Luke 23:25 And he released him that for a seditious movement, and for murder, had been thrown into prison, whom they demanded; but Jesus, he delivered up to their will. <div eID="gen591" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen592" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it after Jesus.
Luke 23:27 And there followed him a great number of the people, and of women that bewailed and lamented him.
Luke 23:28 But Jesus turned, and said to them, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
Luke 23:29 For, behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck.
Luke 23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
Luke 23:31 For, if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry? <div eID="gen592" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen593" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:32 And two others, who were evil-doers, were led out to be put to death with him.
Luke 23:33 And when they came to the place called Skull, they there crucified him and the evil-doers; one on the right, and the other on the left.
Luke 23:34 And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And dividing his clothing into parts, they cast lots.
Luke 23:35 And the people stood and looked on. And the rulers, with them scoffed at him, saying: He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.
Luke 23:36 The soldiers also derided him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
Luke 23:37 and saying: If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.
Luke 23:38 And a superscription was also written over him in Greek and in Roman and in Hebrew letters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <div eID="gen593" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen594" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:39 And one of the evil-doers that were hanged reviled him, saying: If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.
Luke 23:40 But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Do you not fear God, since you are in the same condemnation?
Luke 23:41 And we justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.
Luke 23:42 And he said to Jesus: Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom.
Luke 23:43 And Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, to-day you shall be with me in paradise. <div eID="gen594" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen595" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land till the ninth hour.
Luke 23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.
Luke 23:46 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And when he had said this, he gave up his spirit. <div eID="gen595" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen596" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:47 When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying: Truly, this was a righteous man.
Luke 23:48 And all the multitudes that had come together to that sight, when they saw what was done, returned, smiting their breasts.
Luke 23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance looking on these things. <div eID="gen596" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen597" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor, a good and a just man;
Luke 23:51 (he had not given his consent to their counsel and deed;) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he himself also waited for the kingdom of God:
Luke 23:52 this man came to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke 23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that had been hewed in rock, in which no one had yet been laid.
Luke 23:54 And the day was the preparation, and the sabbath was beginning. <div eID="gen597" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen598" type="x-p"/>
Luke 23:55 And the women that had come with him from Galilee followed after and saw the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.

Luke 24:1 And on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and with them came certain others.
Luke 24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher;
Luke 24:3 and they entered in, but found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke 24:4 And it came to pass, while they were much perplexed at this, behold, two men stood by them in shining raiment.
Luke 24:5 And while they feared and bowed their faces to the earth, they said to them: Why seek you among the dead for him that lives?
Luke 24:6 He is not here, but he has risen; remember that he spoke to you while he was yet in Galilee,
Luke 24:7 saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. <div eID="gen599" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen600" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:8 And they remembered his words,
Luke 24:9 and returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven and to the rest.
Luke 24:10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, and the others with them, that told these things to the apostles.
Luke 24:11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
Luke 24:12 But Peter arose and ran to the sepulcher, and stooping down, he saw the linen clothes lying by themselves; and he departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass. <div eID="gen600" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen601" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:13 And, behold, two of them were going, on the same day, to a village called Emmaus, distant from Jerusalem sixty furlongs.
Luke 24:14 And they were talking to one another about all these things which had taken place.
Luke 24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they conversed and reasoned together, Jesus himself drew near, and went on with them.
Luke 24:16 But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not recognize him.
Luke 24:17 And he said to them: What matters are these which you are discussing with one another as you walk and are sad? <div eID="gen601" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen602" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:18 And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to him: Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things that have taken place there in these days?
Luke 24:19 And he said to them: What things? They said to him: The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people;
Luke 24:20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
Luke 24:21 But we trusted that it was he that was about to redeem Israel. And besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.
Luke 24:22 And further, certain women of our company, who were early at the sepulcher, astonished us:
Luke 24:23 for they found not his body, and came and told that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
Luke 24:24 And some of those who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even as the women had said, but him they saw not. <div eID="gen602" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen603" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:25 And he said to them: O inconsiderate, and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets have spoken!
Luke 24:26 Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
Luke 24:27 And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, he explained to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himself.
Luke 24:28 And they drew near the village to which they were going; and he made as if he would go further.
Luke 24:29 And they constrained him, saying: Remain with us, for it is near the evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them. <div eID="gen603" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen604" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:30 And it came to pass, while he reclined at table with them, that he took bread and blessed; and he broke, and gave it to them.
Luke 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he disappeared from them.
Luke 24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? <div eID="gen604" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen605" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:33 And they arose the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven, and those who were with them, assembled,
Luke 24:34 and saying: The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.
Luke 24:35 And they told what had taken place on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread. <div eID="gen605" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen606" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:36 And while they were speaking of these things, Jesus him self stood in the midst of them, and said to them: Peace be to you.
Luke 24:37 But they were terrified and frightened, and thought that they saw a spirit.
Luke 24:38 And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
Luke 24:39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.
Luke 24:40 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
Luke 24:41 And while they did not believe as yet for joy, and were astonished, he said to them: Have you any thing here to eat?
Luke 24:42 And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.
Luke 24:43 And he took it, and did eat before them. <div eID="gen606" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen607" type="x-p"/>
Luke 24:44 And he said to them: These are the words that I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled that are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
Luke 24:45 Then he opened their mind, that they might understand the scriptures,
Luke 24:46 and he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus was it necessary that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day,
Luke 24:47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
Luke 24:48 You are witnesses of these things.

John 1:1 In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with God, and the WORD was God.
John 1:2 He was in the beginning with God.
John 1:3 All things were made by him, and without him not one thing was made that now exists.
John 1:4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
John 1:5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not. <div eID="gen610" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen611" type="x-p"/>
John 1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

John 1:8 He was not the Light; but he came to testify of the Light. <div eID="gen611" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen612" type="x-p"/>
John 1:9 He was the true Light, which, coming into the world, gives light to every man.

John 1:11 He came to his own country, and his own people received him not.
John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them he gave the privilege of becoming the children of God, even to those who believe on his name;
John 1:13 who were begotten, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
John 1:14 And the WORD became flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and of truth. <div eID="gen612" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen613" type="x-p"/>
John 1:15 John testified of him, and cried, saying: This is he of whom I said: He that comes after me, is now before me, for he existed before me.
John 1:16 And from his fullness have we all received, even grace for grace;
John 1:17 for the law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth came through Jesus Christ.
John 1:18 No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has revealed him. <div eID="gen613" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen614" type="x-p"/>
John 1:19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: Who are you?
John 1:20 And he confessed, and did not deny; and he confessed: I am not the Christ.
John 1:21 And they asked him: What then? Are you Elijah? And he said: I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered: No.
John 1:22 They then said to him: Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what say you of yourself?
John 1:23 He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord; as said the prophet Isaiah. <div eID="gen614" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen615" type="x-p"/>
John 1:24 And those who were sent were of the Pharisees;
John 1:25 and they asked him, and said to him: Why, then, do you immerse, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?
John 1:26 John answered them, saying: I immerse in water; but there stands one among you whom you know not.
John 1:27 He it is, who, though he comes after me, is now before me; the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose.
John 1:28 These things were done in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing. <div eID="gen615" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen616" type="x-p"/>
John 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said: Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.
John 1:30 This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is now before me, for he existed before me.
John 1:31 And I knew him not; but that he might be made manifest to Israel, for this reason I have come immersing in water.
John 1:32 And John testified, saying: I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.
John 1:33 And I knew him not; but he that sent me to immerse in water, said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining, this is he that immerses in the Holy Spirit.

John 1:35 Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.
John 1:36 And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said: Behold the Lamb of God.
John 1:37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John 1:38 And Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them:
John 1:39 What do you seek? They said to him: Rabbi, (which, when translated, is called Teacher,) where abidest thou?
John 1:40 He said to them: Come and see. They went and saw where he abode; and they remained with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour.
John 1:41 One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
John 1:42 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him: We have found the Messiah; (which, when translated, is the Christ;)
John 1:43 and he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looking on him, said: You are Simon, the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which, when translated, is Rock). <div eID="gen617" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen618" type="x-p"/>

John 1:50 Nathaniel answered and said to him: Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
John 1:51 Jesus answered and said to him: Do you believe, because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree? You shall see greater things than these.

John 2:1 And on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
John 2:2 And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.
John 2:3 And the wine having failed, the mother of Jesus said to him: They have no wine.
John 2:4 Jesus said to her: Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour has not yet come.
John 2:5 His mother said to the servants: Whatever he says to you, do.
John 2:6 Now, according to the Jewish custom of purifying, six water-pots of stone had been set there, containing each two or three baths. <div eID="gen620" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen621" type="x-p"/>
John 2:7 Jesus said to them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.
John 2:8 And he said to them: Draw out now, and carry it to the governor of the feast. And they carried it.
John 2:9 When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that had been made wine, (and he knew not whence it was, but the servants that had drawn the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and said to him:
John 2:10 Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is inferior; but you have kept the good wino till now.
John 2:11 This beginning of signs Jesus made in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him. <div eID="gen621" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen622" type="x-p"/>

John 2:13 And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John 2:14 And he found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
John 2:15 And when he had made a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also, and the oxen, and he poured out the money of the money-changers, and overthrew their tables;
John 2:16 and said to those who sold doves: Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
John 2:17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house has eaten me up. <div eID="gen623" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen624" type="x-p"/>

John 2:20 Then the Jews said to him: Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rebuild it in three days?
John 2:21 But he spoke of the temple of his body.
John 2:22 When, therefore, he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. And they believed the scripture, and the word that Jesus had spoken. <div eID="gen624" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen625" type="x-p"/>
John 2:23 And while he was in Jerusalem, during the feast of passover, many believed on his name, because they saw the signs that he did.
John 2:24 But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,
John 2:25 and had no need that any one should testify of man, for he himself knew what was in man.  <chapter eID="John.2"/> <div eID="gen625" type="x-p"/>

John 3:1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
John 3:2 This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou hast come as a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him. <div eID="gen626" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen627" type="x-p"/>
John 3:3 Jesus answered and said to him: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God. <div eID="gen627" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen628" type="x-p"/>
John 3:4 Nicodemus said to him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother’s womb the second time, and be born? <div eID="gen628" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen629" type="x-p"/>
John 3:5 Jesus answered: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God.
John 3:6 That which is begotten of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is begotten of the Spirit, is spirit.
John 3:7 Wonder not that I said to you, you must all be born again,
John 3:8 The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear his voice, but you know not whence he comes, and whither he goes; so is every one that is begotten of the Spirit. <div eID="gen629" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen630" type="x-p"/>
John 3:9 Nicodemus answered and said to him: How can these things be?
John 3:10 Jesus answered and said to him: Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?
John 3:11 Verily, verily, I say to you, we speak that which we know, and testify to that which we have seen; and you receive not our testimony.
John 3:12 If I have told you of earthly things, and you believe not, how will you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
John 3:13 And no man has ascended into heaven, but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.
John 3:14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up;
John 3:15 that whoever believes on him may not perish, but have eternal life.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
John 3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through him, might be saved. <div eID="gen630" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen631" type="x-p"/>
John 3:18 He that believes on him is not condemned; but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
John 3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
John 3:20 For every one that does evil, hates the light, and comes not to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.
John 3:21 But he that does the truth, comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are done in God. <div eID="gen631" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen632" type="x-p"/>
John 3:22 After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea, and he remained there with them, and immersed.
John 3:23 And John also was immersing in Ænon, near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed;
John 3:24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison. <div eID="gen632" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen633" type="x-p"/>
John 3:25 There arose, therefore, a dispute between some of John’s disciples and a Jew, about purification.
John 3:26 And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore testimony, behold, he immerses, and all are going to him. <div eID="gen633" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen634" type="x-p"/>
John 3:27 John answered and said: A man can receive nothing unless it be given to him from heaven.
John 3:28 You yourselves will testify for me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
John 3:29 He that has the bride, is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly on account of the voice of the bridegroom. This, my joy, is therefore complete.
John 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease. <div eID="gen634" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen635" type="x-p"/>
John 3:31 He that comes from above, is over all. He that is from the earth, is from the earth, and speaks from the earth. He that comes from heaven, is over all;
John 3:32 and what he has seen and heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.
John 3:33 He that has received his testimony has solemnly declared that God is true.
John 3:34 For he whom God has sent, speaks the words of God; for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.
John 3:35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
John 3:36 He that believes on the Son has eternal life. But he that believes not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  <chapter eID="John.3"/> <div eID="gen635" type="x-p"/>

John 4:1 When, therefore, the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and immersing more disciples than John,
John 4:2 (though not Jesus himself, but his disciples immersed,)
John 4:3 he left Judea, and went again into Galilee.
John 4:4 And it was necessary that he should go through Samaria.
John 4:5 He came, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
John 4:6 And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, therefore, wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour. <div eID="gen636" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen637" type="x-p"/>
John 4:7 There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said to her: Give me to drink.
John 4:8 For his disciples had gone into the city to buy food.
John 4:9 Then the woman of Samaria said to him: How is it that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? (For the Jews have no social intercourse with the Samaritans.)
John 4:10 Jesus answered and said to her: If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.
John 4:11 The woman said to him: Sir, you have no vessel with which you can draw, and the well is deep; whence have you that living water?
John 4:12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle? <div eID="gen637" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen638" type="x-p"/>
John 4:13 Jesus answered and said to her: Whoever drinks of this water, will thirst again;
John 4:14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him, shall never thirst. But the water that I will give him, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up in order to eternal life. <div eID="gen638" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen639" type="x-p"/>
John 4:15 The woman said to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw. <div eID="gen639" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen640" type="x-p"/>
John 4:16 Jesus said to her: Go, call your husband, and come hither.
John 4:17 The woman answered and said: I have no husband. <div eID="gen640" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen641" type="x-p"/> Jesus said to her: You have well said. I have no husband;
John 4:18 for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.
John 4:19 The woman said to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
John 4:20 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where we ought to worship. <div eID="gen641" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen642" type="x-p"/>
John 4:21 Jesus said to her: Woman, believe me, the hour is coming, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.
John 4:22 You worship you know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is of the Jews.
John 4:23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such to worship him.
John 4:24 God is spirit; and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.
John 4:25 The woman said to him: I know that Messiah (who is called Christ) is coming; when he comes, he will tell us all things. <div eID="gen642" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen643" type="x-p"/>
John 4:26 Jesus said to her: I who speak to you am he.
John 4:27 And upon this his disciples came, and were astonished that he was talking with the woman. Yet no one said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her? <div eID="gen643" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen644" type="x-p"/>
John 4:28 Then the woman left her water-pot, and went into the city, and said to the men:
John 4:29 Come, see a man who has told me all things that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?
John 4:30 Then they went out of the city and came to him. <div eID="gen644" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen645" type="x-p"/>
John 4:31 In the mean time, the disciples besought him, saying: Rabbi, eat.
John 4:32 But he said to them: I have food to eat of which you know not.
John 4:33 Then the disciples said one to another: Has any one brought him food?
John 4:34 Jesus said to them: My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
John 4:35 Do you not say, There are yet four months, and harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, for they are already white for the harvest.
John 4:36 And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal; that he that sows, and he that reaps, may rejoice together.
John 4:37 For in this is the saying true, One sows and another reaps.
John 4:38 I have sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labors. <div eID="gen645" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen646" type="x-p"/>
John 4:39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all things that I ever did.
John 4:40 When, therefore, the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to abide with them. And he abode there two days.
John 4:41 And many more believed because of his own word;
John 4:42 and they said to the woman: We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this is in truth the Savior of the world, the Christ. <div eID="gen646" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen647" type="x-p"/>
John 4:43 And after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee;
John 4:44 for Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
John 4:45 Therefore, when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, because they had seen all things that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast. <div eID="gen647" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen648" type="x-p"/>
John 4:46 Then Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier, whose sou was sick in Capernaum.
John 4:47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and restore his son to health, for he was about to die.
John 4:48 Then said Jesus to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.
John 4:49 The courtier said to him: Sir, come down before my child die.
John 4:50 Jesus said to him: Go, your child lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke, and departed.
John 4:51 And as he was going down, his servants met him, and said: Your son lives.
John 4:52 Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was restored to health. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.
John 4:53 Then his father knew that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself, and all his house, believed.
John 4:54 This is the second sign which Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee.  <chapter eID="John.4"/> <div eID="gen648" type="x-p"/>

John 5:1 After this was the feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John 5:2 Now there is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a pool, called, in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, with five porches.
John 5:3 In these lay a great multitude of sick persons, blind, lame, withered, who waited for the moving of the water.
John 5:4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and stirred the water. Then he who entered first after the motion of the water, was cured of whatever disease he had. <div eID="gen649" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen650" type="x-p"/>
John 5:5 And a certain man was there, who had been sick thirty-eight years.
John 5:6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been already a long time in that condition, he said to him: Do you wish to be restored to health?
John 5:7 The sick man answered him: Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
John 5:8 Jesus said to him: Arise, take up your bed and walk.
John 5:9 And the man was immediately restored to health; and he took up his bed and walked. And that day was the sabbath. <div eID="gen650" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen651" type="x-p"/>
John 5:10 The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
John 5:11 He answered them: He that restored me to health said to me, Take up your bed and walk.
John 5:12 Then they asked him: Who is he that said to you, Take up your bed and walk?
John 5:13 But he that had been restored to health knew not who he was; for Jesus had withdrawn himself, because a multitude was in the place.
John 5:14 After this Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him: Behold, you have been restored to health; sin no more, lest some worse thing befall you.
John 5:15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus that had restored him to health.
John 5:16 And for this reason did the Jews persecute Jesus, and seek to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath. <div eID="gen651" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen652" type="x-p"/>
John 5:17 But Jesus answered them: My Father works till now, and I also work.
John 5:18 For this reason, therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his own father, making himself equal with God. <div eID="gen652" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen653" type="x-p"/>
John 5:19 Then Jesus answered and said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do; for whatever things he does, these also the Son does in like manner.
John 5:20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may be astonished.
John 5:21 For as the Father raises the dead, and makes them alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.
John 5:22 For the Father judges no one, but has given all judicial authority to the Son;
John 5:23 that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father who sent him. <div eID="gen653" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen654" type="x-p"/>
John 5:24 Verily, verily I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into condemnation, but has passed from death into life.
John 5:25 Verily, verily I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear, shall live.
John 5:26 For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son also to have life in himself;
John 5:27 and he has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
John 5:28 Be not astonished at this; for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
John 5:29 and shall come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.
John 5:30 I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me. <div eID="gen654" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen655" type="x-p"/>
John 5:31 If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not worthy of credit.
John 5:32 There is another that testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning me is worthy of credit.
John 5:33 You sent to John, and he bore testimony to the truth.
John 5:34 But I receive not testimony from man; yet I say these things that you may be saved.
John 5:35 He was the burning and shining lamp; and you were willing, for a time, to rejoice in his light.
John 5:36 But I have testimony greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I do, testify concerning me, that the Father has sent me.
John 5:37 And the Father, who sent me, has testified concerning me. You have, neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
John 5:38 And his word you have not remaining in you; for whom he has sent, him you believe not. <div eID="gen655" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen656" type="x-p"/>
John 5:39 You search the scriptures, because in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify concerning me:
John 5:40 and yet you refuse to come to me, that you may have life.
John 5:41 I receive not honor from men.
John 5:42 But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.
John 5:43 I have come in my Father’s name, and you receive me not; if another should come in his own name, him you would receive.
John 5:44 How can you believe who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that comes from God alone?
John 5:45 Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.
John 5:46 For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
John 5:47 But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?  <chapter eID="John.5"/> <div eID="gen656" type="x-p"/>

John 6:1 After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
John 6:2 And a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the signs which he did in the case of the sick.
John 6:3 And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples.
John 6:4 And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
John 6:5 Then Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?
John 6:6 But this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was about to do. <div eID="gen657" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen658" type="x-p"/>
John 6:7 Philip answered him: Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, that each may take a little.
John 6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
John 6:9 There is a lad here that has five barley loaves, and two little fishes; but what are these among so many?
John 6:10 But Jesus said: Make die men recline. Now, there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.
John 6:11 And Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks, distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who had reclined; and in like manner of the fishes, as much as they wished.
John 6:12 And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples: Gather up the broken pieces which remain, that nothing be lost.
John 6:13 Then they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the broken pieces of the five barley loaves, which remained after they had eaten. <div eID="gen658" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen659" type="x-p"/>
John 6:14 Then the men, after having seen the sign which Jesus did, said: This is, in truth, the prophet that was to come into the world.
John 6:15 Therefore, Jesus perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew into the mountain himself alone. <div eID="gen659" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen660" type="x-p"/>
John 6:16 And when evening had come, his disciples went down to the sea,
John 6:17 and, having entered the ship, went across the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
John 6:18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that was blowing.
John 6:19 Then, having rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near the ship; and they were afraid.
John 6:20 But he said to them: It is I; be not afraid.
John 6:21 Then they willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were going. <div eID="gen660" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen661" type="x-p"/>
John 6:22 The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, seeing that no other boat had been there but the one which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone;
John 6:23 (but there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks;)
John 6:24 when, therefore, the multitude saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they also entered the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. <div eID="gen661" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen662" type="x-p"/>
John 6:25 And finding him on the opposite side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when didst thou come hither?
John 6:26 Jesus answered them, and said: Verily, verily I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.
John 6:27 Labor not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to life eternal, which the Son of man will give you; for him has God the Father attested.
John 6:28 Then they said to him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
John 6:29 Jesus answered and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.
John 6:30 Therefore, they said to him: What sign do you show, then, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you perform?
John 6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. <div eID="gen662" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen663" type="x-p"/>
John 6:32 Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
John 6:33 For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life for the world.
John 6:34 Then they said to him: Lord, evermore give us this bread.
John 6:35 Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger; he that believes on me shall never thirst.
John 6:36 But I said to you, that you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.
John 6:37 All that the Father gives me, will come to me; and him that comes to me, I will by no means cast out.
John 6:38 For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John 6:39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all that he gives me, I shall lose nothing, but shall raise it up at the last day.
John 6:40 For this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. <div eID="gen663" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen664" type="x-p"/>
John 6:41 Then the Jews murmured at him, because he said, I am like bread that came down from heaven.
John 6:42 And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I came down from heaven?
John 6:43 Jesus answered and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves;
John 6:44 no man can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
John 6:45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hears from the Father, and learns, comes to me.
John 6:46 Not that any one has seen the Father, but he who is from God; he has seen the Father. <div eID="gen664" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen665" type="x-p"/>
John 6:47 Verily, verily I say to you, He that believes on me has eternal life.
John 6:48 I am the bread of life.
John 6:49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.
John 6:50 This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that any one may eat of it, and not die.
John 6:51 I am the bread that lives, which came down from heaven. If any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. <div eID="gen665" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen666" type="x-p"/>
John 6:52 The Jews, therefore, contended among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
John 6:53 Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
John 6:54 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day;
John 6:55 for my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
John 6:56 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.
John 6:57 As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.
John 6:58 This is the bread that came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; he that eats this bread shall live forever. <div eID="gen666" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen667" type="x-p"/>
John 6:59 These things he spoke in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
John 6:60 Therefore, many of his disciples, when they heard him, said: This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
John 6:61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them: Does this offend you?
John 6:62 Then, what if you should see the Son of man go up where he was before?
John 6:63 It is the spirit that makes alive; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I speak to you are spirit and life.
John 6:64 But there are some among you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him.
John 6:65 And he said: For this reason I said to you: No one can come to me unless it be given him from my Father. <div eID="gen667" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen668" type="x-p"/>
John 6:66 After this, many of his disciples went back, and walked with him no more.
John 6:67 Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you also go away?
John 6:68 Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life;
John 6:69 and we believe, and know that thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
John 6:70 Jesus answered them: Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
John 6:71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.  <chapter eID="John.6"/> <div eID="gen668" type="x-p"/>

John 7:1 And after this Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. <div eID="gen669" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen670" type="x-p"/>
John 7:2 Now the feast of tabernacles, a feast of the Jews, was near.
John 7:3 Then his brothers said to him: Depart hence, and go into Judea, that your disciples may see your works which you do;
John 7:4 for no one does any thing in secret, while he himself seeks to be before the public. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
John 7:5 For neither did his brothers believe on him.
John 7:6 Then Jesus said to them: My time has not yet come; but your time is always ready.
John 7:7 The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
John 7:8 Do you go up to this feast. I go not up now to this feast, because my time has not yet fully come.
John 7:9 These things said he to them, and remained in Galilee.
John 7:10 But when his brothers had gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret. <div eID="gen670" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen671" type="x-p"/>
John 7:11 Then the Jews sought for him at the feast, and said: Where is he?
John 7:12 And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said: He is a good man. Others said: No; but he deceives the multitude.
John 7:13 However, no one spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews. <div eID="gen671" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen672" type="x-p"/>
John 7:14 Now in the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
John 7:15 And the Jews were astonished, and said: How has this man a knowledge of letters, having never been taught?
John 7:16 Then Jesus answered and said: My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
John 7:17 If any one will do his will, he shall know with respect to the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak of myself.
John 7:18 He who speaks of himself, seeks his own glory; he who seeks the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
John 7:19 Did not Moses give you the law? and not one of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?
John 7:20 The multitude answered and said: You have a demon: who seeks to kill you? <div eID="gen672" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen673" type="x-p"/>
John 7:21 Jesus answered and said to them: I have done one work, and you are all astonished on account of this.
John 7:22 Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath-day.
John 7:23 If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I have restored the entire man to health on the sabbath-day?
John 7:24 Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment. <div eID="gen673" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen674" type="x-p"/>
John 7:25 Then said some of the men of Jerusalem: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
John 7:26 and, lo, he is speaking boldly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers really learned that this is the Christ?
John 7:27 But we know this man, whence he is. But when the Christ comes, no one knows whence he is. <div eID="gen674" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen675" type="x-p"/>
John 7:28 Then Jesus cried out in the temple, as he was teaching, and said: You both know me, and you know whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you know not.
John 7:29 But I know him, because I am from him, and he has sent me.
John 7:30 Then they sought to take him; yet no one laid his hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
John 7:31 And many of the multitude believed on him, and said: When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these which this man has done? <div eID="gen675" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen676" type="x-p"/>
John 7:32 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent attendants to take him.
John 7:33 Then Jesus said to them: Yet a little while I am with you, and I go away to him that sent me.
John 7:34 You will seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you can not come.
John 7:35 Then the Jews said among themselves: Whither is this man about to go, that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to those who are dispersed among the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?
John 7:36 What means this saying which he uttered, You will seek me, and will not find me; and, Where I am you can not come? <div eID="gen676" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen677" type="x-p"/>
John 7:37 On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.
John 7:38 He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, from his inner self shall flow rivers of living water.
John 7:39 But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believe on him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
John 7:40 Therefore, many of the multitude, when they had heard this word, said: This is, in truth, the prophet.
John 7:41 Others said: This is the Christ. But others said: Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
John 7:42 Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the posterity of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?
John 7:43 So there was a division among the multitude because of him.
John 7:44 And some of them desired to take him; but no one laid hands on him. <div eID="gen677" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen678" type="x-p"/>
John 7:45 Then came the attendants to the chief priests and the Pharisees; and they said to them: Why have you not brought him?
John 7:46 The attendants answered: Never did man speak like this man.
John 7:47 Then the Pharisees answered them: Are you also deceived?
John 7:48 Has any one of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?
John 7:49 But this multitude that know not the law are cursed.
John 7:50 Nicodemus said to them (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them):
John 7:51 Does our law condemn a man unless it first hear from him, and know what he does?
John 7:52 They answered and said to him: Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee arises no prophet. <div eID="gen678" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen679" type="x-p"/>

John 8:1 But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
John 8:2 And in the morning he again entered the temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
John 8:3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman who had been detected in adultery; and they made her stand in the midst,
John 8:4 and said to him: Teacher, this woman was detected in adultery; in the very act.
John 8:5 Now Moses, in his law, commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what say you?
John 8:6 This they said to tempt him, that they might bring an accusation against him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John 8:7 But as they continued to ask him, he stood up, and said to them: Let him among you who is without sin, first throw a stone at her.
John 8:8 And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
John 8:9 But having heard him, and being convicted by their conscience, they went out, one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
John 8:10 And when Jesus stood up, and saw no one but the woman, he said to her: Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?
John 8:11 She said: No one, sir. Jesus said to her: Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more. <div eID="gen680" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen681" type="x-p"/>
John 8:12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying: I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
John 8:13 Then the Pharisees said to him: You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not worthy of credit.
John 8:14 Jesus answered and said to them: Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony is worthy of credit; for I know whence I came, and whither I go. But you know not whence I came, and whither I go.
John 8:15 You judge according to the flesh; I judge no man.
John 8:16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.
John 8:17 It is also written in your law, The testimony of two is worthy of credit.
John 8:18 I am one that testify concerning myself, and the Father who sent me, testifies of me. <div eID="gen681" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen682" type="x-p"/>
John 8:19 Then they said to him: Where is your Father? Jesus answered: You know neither me, nor my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.
John 8:20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come. <div eID="gen682" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen683" type="x-p"/>
John 8:21 Then spoke Jesus to them again; I go away, and you will seek me, and in your sin you shall die; whither I go, you can not come.
John 8:22 Then said the Jews: Will he kill himself, because he says, Whither I go, you can not come?
John 8:23 And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
John 8:24 Therefore said I to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am, He, you shall die in your sins.
John 8:25 Then they said to him: Who are you? And Jesus said to them: The same that I said to you at the beginning.
John 8:26 I have many things to say, and to judge with respect to you; but he that sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him, these I speak to the world.
John 8:27 They knew not that he was speaking to them of the Father. <div eID="gen683" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen684" type="x-p"/>
John 8:28 Then said Jesus to them: When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things.
John 8:29 And he that sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him. <div eID="gen684" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen685" type="x-p"/>
John 8:30 While he was speaking these words, many believed on him.
John 8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews that believed on him: If you continue in my word, you are my disciples indeed,
John 8:32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
John 8:33 They answered him: We are the posterity of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How say you, You shall be made free? <div eID="gen685" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen686" type="x-p"/>
John 8:34 Jesus answered them: Verily, verily I say to you, whoever works sin is the servant of sin.
John 8:35 The servant continues not in the house forever; but the Son continues forever.
John 8:36 Therefore, if the Son make you free, you shall be free indeed.
John 8:37 I know that you are the posterity of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
John 8:38 I speak what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.
John 8:39 They answered and said to him: Abra ham is our father. <div eID="gen686" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen687" type="x-p"/> Jesus said to them: If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
John 8:40 But now you seek to kill me, a man that has spoken to you the truth, which I have heard from God; this Abraham did not.
John 8:41 You do the works of your father. They said to him: We were not born of lewdness; we have one father, God. <div eID="gen687" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen688" type="x-p"/>
John 8:42 Jesus said to them: If God were your father, you would love me; for I came forth from God and have come hither; nor, indeed, did I come of myself, but he sent me.
John 8:43 Why do you not know what I say? Because you can not understand my words.
John 8:44 You are of your father, the devil; and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks that which is false, he speaks from what is his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.
John 8:45 But because I speak the truth, you believe me not.
John 8:46 Which of you convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
John 8:47 He that is of God, hears God’s words. For this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God. <div eID="gen688" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen689" type="x-p"/>
John 8:48 The Jews answered, and said to him: Do we not well say that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?
John 8:49 Jesus answered: I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
John 8:50 I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks and judges.
John 8:51 Verily, verily I say to you, if any one will keep my word, he shall never see death. <div eID="gen689" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen690" type="x-p"/>
John 8:52 Then said the Jews to him: Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
John 8:53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead; whom do you make yourself? <div eID="gen690" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen691" type="x-p"/>
John 8:54 Jesus answered: If I honor myself, my honor is nothing; it is my Father that honors me, of whom you say, that he is your God.
John 8:55 And yet you have not known him. But I know him; and if I should say that I do not know him, I should be like yourselves, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.
John 8:56 Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he could see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
John 8:57 Then the Jews said to him: You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham? <div eID="gen691" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen692" type="x-p"/>
John 8:58 Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I was.
John 8:59 Then they took up stones to throw at him. But Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them; and so passed by.  <chapter eID="John.8"/> <div eID="gen692" type="x-p"/>

John 9:1 And as he passed by, he saw a man that had been blind from his birth.
John 9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying: Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
John 9:3 Jesus answered: Neither this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God might be made manifest in him.
John 9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.
John 9:5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
John 9:6 Having said this, he spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on the eyes of the blind man,
John 9:7 and said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloam; which, translated, means Sent. He went, therefore, and washed and came seeing. <div eID="gen693" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen694" type="x-p"/>
John 9:8 Then his neighbors, and those who had before seen him, that he was blind, said: Is not this he that sat and begged?
John 9:9 Some said: It is he. Others: He is like him. But he said: I am he.
John 9:10 Then they said to him: How were your eyes opened?
John 9:11 He answered and said: A man called Jesus made clay and spread it on my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. After I had gone and washed, I received my sight.
John 9:12 Then they said to him: Where is he? He said: I know not. <div eID="gen694" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen695" type="x-p"/>
John 9:13 They brought to the Pharisees him that had formerly been blind.
John 9:14 And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
John 9:15 Then again the Pharisees also inquired of him how he had received his sight. He said to them: He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
John 9:16 Then some of the Pharisees said: This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them? <div eID="gen695" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen696" type="x-p"/>
John 9:17 Again they said to the blind man: What say you of him, seeing that he opened your eyes? He said: He is a prophet.
John 9:18 The Jews did not, therefore, believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, till they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
John 9:19 and asked them, saying: Is this your son, who, you say, was born blind? How, then, does he now see?
John 9:20 His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
John 9:21 but how he now sees we know not; or who opened his eyes we know not. He is of age; ask him; he will speak for himself. <div eID="gen696" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen697" type="x-p"/>
John 9:22 His parents said this, because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed, that if any one should confess him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
John 9:23 For this reason his parents said: He is of age; ask him. <div eID="gen697" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen698" type="x-p"/>
John 9:24 Then, the second time, they called the man who had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
John 9:25 He answered and said: If he is a sinner, I know it not. One thing I do know, that having been blind, I now see.
John 9:26 They said to him again: What did he for you? How did he open your eyes?
John 9:27 He answered them: I have already told you, and you did not understand; why would you hear it again? Do you also wish to become his disciples?
John 9:28 They reviled him, and said: You are the disciple of that man; but we are the disciples of Moses.
John 9:29 We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we know not whence he is. <div eID="gen698" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen699" type="x-p"/>
John 9:30 The man answered and said to them: Why, there is something wonderful in this, that you know not whence he is, and yet he has opened my eyes.
John 9:31 We know that God hears not sinners; but if any one be a worshiper of God, and do his will, him he hears.
John 9:32 Since the beginning it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one who had been born blind.
John 9:33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
John 9:34 They answered and said to him: You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out. <div eID="gen699" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen700" type="x-p"/>
John 9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And having found him, he said to him: Do you believe on the Son of God?
John 9:36 He answered and said: Who is he, sir, that I may believe on him?
John 9:37 Jesus said to him: You have seen him; and it is he that talks with you.
John 9:38 He said: Lord, I believe; and he worshiped him.
John 9:39 And Jesus said: For judgment have I come into this world, that those who see not, may see; and that those who see, may become blind. <div eID="gen700" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen701" type="x-p"/>
John 9:40 And some of the Pharisees who were with him, heard these things, and said to him: Are we also blind?

John 10:1 Verily, verily I say to you, he that goes not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief, and a robber.
John 10:2 But he that enters through the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.
John 10:3 To him the door-keeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
John 10:4 And when he puts his own sheep out, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice.
John 10:5 And a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers. <div eID="gen702" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen703" type="x-p"/>
John 10:6 This parable spoke Jesus to them; but they knew not the meaning of the things which he spoke to them.
John 10:7 Therefore Jesus spoke again to them: Verily, verily I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
John 10:8 All that came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.
John 10:9 I am the door: if any one enters through me, he shall be saved; and he shall go in and out, and find pasture.
John 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in abundance.
John 10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
John 10:12 But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep, and scatters them.
John 10:13 The hireling flees because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep. <div eID="gen703" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen704" type="x-p"/>
John 10:14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep, and am known by mine.
John 10:15 As the Father knows me, I also know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
John 10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; those, also, must I bring, and they will hear my voice: and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.
John 10:17 For this reason, my Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.
John 10:18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father. <div eID="gen704" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen705" type="x-p"/>
John 10:19 Again, therefore, there was a division among the Jews, on account of these words.
John 10:20 And many of them said: He has a demon, and is mad; why do you hear him?
John 10:21 Others said: These are not the words of one that has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind? <div eID="gen705" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen706" type="x-p"/>

John 10:24 Then the Jews came round him, and said to him: How long do you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.
John 10:25 Jesus answered them: I have told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.
John 10:26 But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep. As I said to you,
John 10:27 my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
John 10:28 and I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall take them out of my hand.
John 10:29 My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to take them out of my Father’s hand.
John 10:30 I and my Father are one. <div eID="gen707" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen708" type="x-p"/>
John 10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again, to stone him.
John 10:32 Jesus answered them: Many good works have I showed you from my Father: for which of these works do you stone me?
John 10:33 The Jews answered and said to him: We do not stone you for a good work, but for your impious words; and because you, being man, make yourself God.
John 10:34 Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?
John 10:35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God was committed, (and the scripture can not be made void,)
John 10:36 do you say of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You speak impiously, because I said, I am the Son of God?
John 10:37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;
John 10:38 but if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him. <div eID="gen708" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen709" type="x-p"/>
John 10:39 Then they sought again to take him, but he escaped from their hands.
John 10:40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan, to the place where John first immersed, and there he abode.
John 10:41 And many came to him, and said: John did no sign; but all things that John said of this man were true.
John 10:42 And many who were there believed on him.  <chapter eID="John.10"/> <div eID="gen709" type="x-p"/>

John 11:1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha her sister.
John 11:2 It was the Mary that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
John 11:3 Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. <div eID="gen710" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen711" type="x-p"/>
John 11:4 But when Jesus heard it, he said: This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God may be glorified.
John 11:5 Now, Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John 11:6 When, therefore, he heard that he was sick, he still remained two days in the place where he was.
John 11:7 Then after this, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.
John 11:8 His disciples said to him: Rabbi, the Jews just now sought to stone thee, and art thou going thither again?
John 11:9 Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks during the day, he does not stumble, for he sees the light of this world.
John 11:10 But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him. <div eID="gen711" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen712" type="x-p"/>
John 11:11 Thus spoke he; and after this he said to them: Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
John 11:12 Then his disciples said: Lord, if he sleeps, he will be saved.
John 11:13 Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
John 11:14 Therefore, Jesus then said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.
John 11:15 And I rejoice, on your account, that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.
John 11:16 Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him. <div eID="gen712" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen713" type="x-p"/>
John 11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had already been four days in the tomb.
John 11:18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.
John 11:19 And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
John 11:20 Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went out to meet him; but Mary sat still in the house.
John 11:21 Then Martha said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here my brother would not have died.
John 11:22 But even now, I know that whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give thee. <div eID="gen713" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen714" type="x-p"/>
John 11:23 Jesus said to her: Your brother shall rise again.
John 11:24 Martha said to him: I know that he will rise, in the resurrection at the last day.
John 11:25 Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believes on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;
John 11:26 and he that lives and believes on me, shall never die. Do you believe this?
John 11:27 She said to him: Yes, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world. <div eID="gen714" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen715" type="x-p"/>
John 11:28 And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying: The Teacher has come, and calls for you.
John 11:29 When she heard it, she rose quickly and came to him.
John 11:30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.
John 11:31 Then the Jews that were with her in the house, and were comforting her, seeing Mary rise and go out quickly, followed her, saying: She is going to the tomb to weep there.
John 11:32 Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died. <div eID="gen715" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen716" type="x-p"/>
John 11:33 Then, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews that came with her weeping also, he was greatly moved in spirit, and troubled;
John 11:34 and he said: Where have you laid him? They said to him: Lord, come and see.
John 11:35 Jesus wept.
John 11:36 Then said the Jews: See how he loved him!
John 11:37 And some of them said: Could not he, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have caused that even this man should not have died?
John 11:38 Then Jesus, again greatly moved within himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was laid against it.
John 11:39 Jesus said: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said to him: Lord, the body is offensive; for he has been dead four days. <div eID="gen716" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen717" type="x-p"/>
John 11:40 Jesus said to her: Did I not tell you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?
John 11:41 Then they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said: Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me.
John 11:42 I know, in deed, that thou dost always hear me. But for the sake of the multitude who stand around me, I have said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
John 11:43 And when he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
John 11:44 And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound around with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go. <div eID="gen717" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen718" type="x-p"/>
John 11:45 Then many of the Jews that had come to Mary, and who saw what he had done, believed on him.
John 11:46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done. <div eID="gen718" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen719" type="x-p"/>
John 11:47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin, and said: What are we doing? For this man does many signs.
John 11:48 If we thus let him alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.
John 11:49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year, said to them: You know nothing,
John 11:50 nor do you consider that it is profitable for us, that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.
John 11:51 But this he did not speak of himself; but being chief priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;
John 11:52 and not for the nation only, but that he should gather into one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
John 11:53 From that day, therefore, they consulted together to put him to death. <div eID="gen719" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen720" type="x-p"/>
John 11:54 Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but withdrew thence to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples.
John 11:55 And the passover of the Jews was near; and many went up from the country to Jerusalem, before the passover, to purify themselves.
John 11:56 Then they sought for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple: What think you, that he will not come to the feast?
John 11:57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders, that, if any one knew where he was, he should inform them, that they might take him.  <chapter eID="John.11"/> <div eID="gen720" type="x-p"/>

John 12:1 Then, six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.
John 12:2 There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him. <div eID="gen721" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen722" type="x-p"/>
John 12:3 Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the perfume of the ointment.
John 12:4 Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was about to deliver him up:
John 12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
John 12:6 But he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and took what was put in it.
John 12:7 Then Jesus said: Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial.
John 12:8 For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always. <div eID="gen722" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen723" type="x-p"/>
John 12:9 Therefore, a great multitude of the Jews learned that he was there; and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
John 12:10 But the chief priests consulted that they might kill Lazarus also,
John 12:11 because on account of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. <div eID="gen723" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen724" type="x-p"/>
John 12:12 On the next day, a great multitude that had come to the feast, having heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,
John 12:13 took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is the king of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.
John 12:14 And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon him, as it is written:
John 12:15 Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king comes, sitting on the colt of an ass.
John 12:16 His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him. <div eID="gen724" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen725" type="x-p"/>
John 12:17 The multitude therefore that was with him, testified that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.
John 12:18 For this reason, also, the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.
John 12:19 Then the Pharisees said among themselves: You see that you gain nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him. <div eID="gen725" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen726" type="x-p"/>
John 12:20 Among those who came to worship at the feast were certain Greeks.
John 12:21 These then came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying: Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
John 12:22 Philip came and told Andrew; and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
John 12:23 But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour has come that the Son of man must be glorified.
John 12:24 Verily, verily I say to you, unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains alone; but if it die, it produces much fruit.
John 12:25 He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to eternal life.
John 12:26 If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant also be. If any one serve me, him will my Father honor. <div eID="gen726" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen727" type="x-p"/>
John 12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this purpose came I to this hour.
John 12:28 Father, glorify thy name. Then there came a voice from heaven: I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.
John 12:29 Then the multitude that stood by and heard it, said: It thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.
John 12:30 Jesus answered and said: This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.
John 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now is the prince of this world cast out.
John 12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.
John 12:33 This he said, signifying what death he was about to die. <div eID="gen727" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen728" type="x-p"/>
John 12:34 The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that the Christ remains forever: and how say you that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
John 12:35 Then Jesus said to them: Yet a little while is the light with you: walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you. For he that walks in the darkness knows not whither he goes.
John 12:36 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become the sons of light. These things spoke Jesus, and he departed, and concealed himself from them. <div eID="gen728" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen729" type="x-p"/>
John 12:37 But though he had done so many signs in their presence, yet they believed not on him,
John 12:38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
John 12:39 For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
John 12:40 He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I should give them health.
John 12:41 These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
John 12:42 But yet, many even of the rulers believed on him; but on account of the Pharisees, they would not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
John 12:43 for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. <div eID="gen729" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen730" type="x-p"/>
John 12:44 Jesus cried, and said: He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.
John 12:45 And he that sees me, sees him that sent me.
John 12:46 I have come a light into the world, that he who believes on me, may not remain in darkness.
John 12:47 And if any one hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
John 12:48 He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has that which judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day.
John 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself: but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.
John 12:50 And I know that his commandment is life eternal. What things I speak therefore, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.  <chapter eID="John.12"/> <div eID="gen730" type="x-p"/>

John 13:1 Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come that he must go out of this world to his Father; and having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them to the end.
John 13:2 And supper being over, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to deliver him up,
John 13:3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had delivered all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was going to God,
John 13:4 arose from supper, and laid aside his garments, and taking a towel, he girded himself.
John 13:5 Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash his disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. <div eID="gen731" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen732" type="x-p"/>
John 13:6 Then he came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
John 13:7 Jesus answered and said to him: What I am doing you know not now, but you will know hereafter.
John 13:8 Peter said to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.
John 13:9 Simon Peter said to him: Lord, not my feet only, but my hands and my head.
John 13:10 Jesus said to him: He that has bathed needs nothing else save to wash his feet, but is wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all.
John 13:11 For he knew who would deliver him up; for this reason he said, You are not all clean. <div eID="gen732" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen733" type="x-p"/>
John 13:12 Therefore, when he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, he reclined at table again, and said to them: Do you understand what I have done for you?
John 13:13 You call me Teacher and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.
John 13:14 If, then, I, your Lord and your Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
John 13:15 For I have given you an example, that you also may do as I have done for you.
John 13:16 Verily, verily I say to you, the servant is not greater than his master, nor is he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
John 13:17 If you know these things, blessed are you, if you do them.
John 13:18 I speak not of you all. I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
John 13:19 I tell you this now, before it comes to pass, that when it comes to pass, you may believe that I am he. <div eID="gen733" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen734" type="x-p"/>

John 13:21 When Jesus had spoken these things, he was troubled in spirit, and testified and said: Verily, verily I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up.
John 13:22 Then the disciples looked at one another, doubting of whom he spoke.
John 13:23 There was reclining on the bosom of Jesus, one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
John 13:24 Then Simon Peter beckoned to this one, that he should inquire who it was of whom he spoke.
John 13:25 And he that was reclining on Jesus breast, said to him: Lord, who is it? <div eID="gen735" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen736" type="x-p"/>
John 13:26 Jesus answered: It is he to whom I shall give this morsel after I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
John 13:27 And after the morsel <transChange type="added">was given</transChange>, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him: What you do, do quickly.
John 13:28 But none of those who reclined at table with him knew for what purpose he said this to him.
John 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy what we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
John 13:30 Then, on receiving the morsel, he immediately went out; and it was night. <div eID="gen736" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen737" type="x-p"/>
John 13:31 When he had gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
John 13:32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will immediately glorify him.
John 13:33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and, as I said to the Jews, whither I go, you can not come, so now I say to you.
John 13:34 A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

John 14:10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. The Father who dwells in me, he does the works.
John 14:11 Believe me, that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me. If not, believe me on account of the works themselves.
John 14:12 Verily, verily I say to you, he that believes on me, the works that I do he also shall do. Even greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father;

John 15:6 If any one abide not in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and withers; and such are gathered, and thrown into the fire, and burned.
John 15:7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done for you.
John 15:8 In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and in this you will be my disciples.
John 15:9 As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.
John 15:10 If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. <div eID="gen746" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen747" type="x-p"/>
John 15:11 These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.
John 15:12 This is my commandment: That you love one another, as I have loved you.
John 15:13 Greater love has no man than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends.
John 15:14 You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
John 15:15 I no longer call you servants, because the servant knows not what his master does. But I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
John 15:16 You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, that you may go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit may remain; that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he may give you.
John 15:17 These things I command you, that you may love one another. <div eID="gen747" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen748" type="x-p"/>
John 15:18 If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.
John 15:19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
John 15:20 Remember the word which I spoke to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.
John 15:21 But all these things they will do to you on my account, because they know not him that sent me.
John 15:22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John 15:23 He that hates me, hates my Father also.
John 15:24 If I had not done among them the works that no other man has done, they would have had no sin; but now they have both seen, and hated both me and my Father.
John 15:25 But this is so, that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. <div eID="gen748" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen749" type="x-p"/>
John 15:26 But when the Paraclete has come, whom I will send to you from my Father, the Spirit of the truth, which proceeds from the Father, he will testify of me;

John 16:1 These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be ensnared.
John 16:2 They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the time is coming, when he that kills you, will think that he is offering service to God.
John 16:3 And these things they will do, because they know neither the Father nor me.
John 16:4 But these things I have told you, that, when the time has come, you may remember that I told you of them. But these things I did not tell you at the beginning, because I was with you.
John 16:5 And now I go to him that sent me, and no one of you asks me, Whither goest thou?
John 16:6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. <div eID="gen750" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen751" type="x-p"/>
John 16:7 But yet I tell you the truth: it is profitable for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Paraclete will not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you.
John 16:8 And when he has come, he will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.
John 16:9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;
John 16:10 of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;
John 16:11 of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. <div eID="gen751" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen752" type="x-p"/>
John 16:12 I have yet many things to say to you; but you can not bear them now.
John 16:13 But when he, the Spirit of the truth, has come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak of himself; but what he hears, that will he speak, and he will show you things to come.
John 16:14 He will glorify me; for he will take of mine, and show it to you.
John 16:15 All things that the Father has are mine; for this reason I said, that he will take of mine, and show it to you.
John 16:16 A little while, and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me, because I go to the Father. <div eID="gen752" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen753" type="x-p"/>
John 16:17 Then some of his disciples said one to another: What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me? and, Be cause I go to the Father?
John 16:18 Therefore they said: What is this that he says, The little while? We know not what he says.
John 16:19 Then Jesus knew that they wished to ask him; and he said to them: Are you inquiring of one another about this, because I said, A little while and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me?
John 16:20 Verily, verily I say to you, you shall weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
John 16:21 A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow, be cause her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no longer remembers the pain, for joy that a man is born into the world.
John 16:22 You, therefore, have sorrow now; but I shall see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you.
John 16:23 And in that day you shall ask nothing of me; verily, verily I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give you.
John 16:24 Till this time you have asked for nothing in my name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full. <div eID="gen753" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen754" type="x-p"/>
John 16:25 These things I have spoken to you in parables; the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but will teach you plainly concerning the Father.
John 16:26 In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father in your behalf;
John 16:27 for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
John 16:28 I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world: again I leave the world, and go to the Father. <div eID="gen754" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen755" type="x-p"/>
John 16:29 His disciples said to him: Lo, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no parable.
John 16:30 Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any one should ask thee. By this we believe that thou hast come forth from God.
John 16:31 Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?
John 16:32 Behold, the hour is coming, and has now come, in which you shall be scattered, each one to his own home, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
John 16:33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have affliction, but be of good courage; I have overcome the world.  <chapter eID="John.16"/> <div eID="gen755" type="x-p"/>

John 17:1 Jesus spoke these words, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: Father, the hour has come: glorify thy Son, that thy Son may also glorify thee;
John 17:2 as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all that thou hast given him.
John 17:3 And this is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.
John 17:4 I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
John 17:5 And now, Father, glorify me with thyself, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. <div eID="gen756" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen757" type="x-p"/>
John 17:6 I have made known thy name to the men that thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them, to me, and they have kept thy word.
John 17:7 Now they know that all things that thou hast given me are from thee;
John 17:8 for the words which thou gavest me I have given them; and they have received them, and they know surely that I came forth from thee, and they believe that thou didst send me.
John 17:9 I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me; for they are thine.
John 17:10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.
John 17:11 And I am no longer in the world; but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep in thy name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are one.
John 17:12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me, I have kept; and none of them is lost but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.
John 17:13 And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. <div eID="gen757" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen758" type="x-p"/>
John 17:14 I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John 17:15 I do not pray thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the Evil One.
John 17:16 They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
John 17:17 Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.
John 17:18 As thou hast sent me into the world, so I send them into the world;
John 17:19 and for them I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.
John 17:20 I pray, not for these only, but for those also who shall believe on me through their word;
John 17:21 that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
John 17:22 And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one;

John 18:1 When Jesus had spoken these things, he went out with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron, where was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
John 18:2 And Judas, who delivered him up, also knew the place, because Jesus often went thither with his disciples.
John 18:3 Judas, then, having received the band of soldiers and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, came thither with torches and lamps and weapons. <div eID="gen760" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen761" type="x-p"/>
John 18:4 Then Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom do you seek?
John 18:5 They answered him: Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them: I am he. Judas, also, who delivered him up, was standing among them.
John 18:6 Then, when he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
John 18:7 Then he asked them again: Whom do you seek? They said: Jesus the Nazarene.
John 18:8 Jesus answered: I have told you that I am he. If, then, you seek me, let these go away.
John 18:9 <transChange type="added">This he said,</transChange> that the word might be fulfilled which he had spoken: Of those whom thou hast given me; I have lost none. <div eID="gen761" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen762" type="x-p"/>
John 18:10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear. The name of the servant was Malchus.
John 18:11 Then Jesus said to Peter: Put up your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that my Father has given me? <div eID="gen762" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen763" type="x-p"/>
John 18:12 Then the band of soldiers, and the officer, and the attendants of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him,
John 18:13 and led him first to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year.
John 18:14 It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was profitable that one man should die for the people. <div eID="gen763" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen764" type="x-p"/>
John 18:15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. And that other disciple was acquainted with the chief priest, and he went in with Jesus into the palace of the chief priest.
John 18:16 But Peter stood without near the door. Then the other disciple, who was acquainted with the chief priest, went out and spoke to the door-keeper, and brought Peter in.
John 18:17 Then the maid-servant who kept the door said to Peter: Are you not also one of the disciples of this man? He said: I am not.
John 18:18 And the servants and the attendants, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, were standing and warming themselves. And Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. <div eID="gen764" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen765" type="x-p"/>
John 18:19 Then the chief priest questioned Jesus concerning his disciples and his teaching.
John 18:20 Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing.
John 18:21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard, what things I said to them. Behold, they know what I have said.
John 18:22 When he had spoken thus, one of the attendants, who was standing by, struck Jesus with his open hand, saying: Do you answer the chief priest thus?
John 18:23 Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me?
John 18:24 Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest. <div eID="gen765" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen766" type="x-p"/>
John 18:25 And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him: Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied, and said: I am not.
John 18:26 One of the servants of the chief priest, who was a kinsman of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said: Did I not see you in the garden with him?
John 18:27 Then Peter denied again. And immediately the cock crew. <div eID="gen766" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen767" type="x-p"/>
John 18:28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace. It was the morning hour. And, in order that they might not be denied, but that they might eat the passover, they did not go into the governor’s palace.
John 18:29 Then Pilate came out to them, and said: What accusation do you bring against this man?
John 18:30 They answered and said to him: If this man were not an evil-doer, we would not have delivered him to you.
John 18:31 Then Pilate said to them: Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any one to death;

John 18:33 Then Pilate again entered the governor’s palace, and called Jesus, and said to him: Are you the king of the Jews?
John 18:34 Jesus answered him: Do you say this of yourself, or did others speak to you of me?
John 18:35 Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Your own nation, and the chief priests have delivered you to me; what have you done?
John 18:36 Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not hence.
John 18:37 Then Pilate said to him: You are a king, then? Jesus answered; You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I born, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might testify to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, hears my voice.

John 19:1 Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus and scourged him.
John 19:2 And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorn-branches, and put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple robe,
John 19:3 and said: Hail, King of the Jews. And they struck him with their open hands. <div eID="gen770" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen771" type="x-p"/>
John 19:4 Then Pilate came out again, and said to them: Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.
John 19:5 Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorn-branches, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them: Be hold the man!
John 19:6 When the chief priests and their attendants saw him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them: Do you take him and crucify him; for I find no fault in him.
John 19:7 The Jews answered: We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. <div eID="gen771" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen772" type="x-p"/>
John 19:8 Then, when Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid;
John 19:9 and he went into the governor’s palace again, and said to Jesus: Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.
John 19:10 Then Pilate said to him: Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and authority to release you?
John 19:11 Jesus answered: You could have no authority over me, had it not been given you from above. Therefore, he that delivered me to you, has the greater sin. <div eID="gen772" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen773" type="x-p"/>
John 19:12 After this Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If you release this man, you are not Cæsar’s friend. Every one that makes himself a king, speaks against Cæsar
John 19:13 Then Pilate, when he heard that word, led Jesus out, and sat on the judgment-seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;
John 19:14 it was the preparation for the passover, and about the third hour; and he said to the Jews, Behold your king!
John 19:15 But they cried out: Away with him, away with him; crucify him! Pilate said to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Cæsar
John 19:16 Then he, therefore, delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. <div eID="gen773" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen774" type="x-p"/>
John 19:17 And, bearing his cross, he went forth into a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called, in Hebrew, Golgotha,
John 19:18 where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle. <div eID="gen774" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen775" type="x-p"/>
John 19:19 And Pilate wrote a superscription, and put it on the cross; and the writing was, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John 19:20 Therefore many of the Jews read this superscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew and in Greek and in Latin.
John 19:21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The king of the Jews; but, that he said, I am the king of the Jews.
John 19:22 Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.
John 19:23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing, and made four parts, to each soldier a part; and they took his coat also. Now his coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
John 19:24 Then they said, one to another, let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. <transChange type="added">This was done</transChange> that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says: They divided my clothing among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.

John 19:25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John 19:26 Then Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, said to his mother: Woman, behold your son.
John 19:27 Then he said to the disciple: Behold your mother. And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home. <div eID="gen776" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen777" type="x-p"/>
John 19:28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.
John 19:29 Now a vessel full of vinegar had been set there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a hyssop-stalk, and put it to his mouth.
John 19:30 Therefore, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said: It is finished. And he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit. <div eID="gen777" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen778" type="x-p"/>
John 19:31 Then the Jews, as it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for that sabbath-day was a great day, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken down.
John 19:32 Then came the soldiers and broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.
John 19:33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs:
John 19:34 but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear; and immediately there came out blood and water. <div eID="gen778" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen779" type="x-p"/>
John 19:35 And he that saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth, that you may believe;
John 19:36 for these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of him shall not be broken.
John 19:37 And again another scripture says: They shall look on him whom they pierced. <div eID="gen779" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen780" type="x-p"/>
John 19:38 And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. He then came and took away the body of Jesus.
John 19:39 Then came Nicodemus also, (who, at the first, had come to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
John 19:40 Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, according to the Jewish custom of burying.
John 19:41 Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.

John 20:3 Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and came to the tomb. <div eID="gen781" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen782" type="x-p"/>
John 20:4 And the two ran together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;

John 20:6 Then came Simon Peter, following him; and he went into the tomb, and saw the linen cloths lying,
John 20:7 and the handkerchief that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded in a place by itself.
John 20:8 Then, therefore, the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, went in, and saw, and believed.
John 20:9 For, as yet, they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
John 20:10 Then the disciples went away again by themselves. <div eID="gen782" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen783" type="x-p"/>

John 20:13 And they said to her: Woman, why do you weep? She said to them: They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
John 20:14 Having said this, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. <div eID="gen783" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen784" type="x-p"/>
John 20:15 Jesus said to her: Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Supposing that it was the gardener, she said to him: Sir, if you have taken him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.
John 20:16 Jesus said to her: Mary. She turned, and said to him: Rabboni; which is, translated, Teacher.
John 20:17 Jesus said to her: Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.
John 20:18 Mary Magdalen came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her. <div eID="gen784" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen785" type="x-p"/>
John 20:19 Then, on that day, the first day of the week, when it was evening, and the doors of the house in which the disciples were assembled had been closed for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.
John 20:20 And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, when they saw the Lord.
John 20:21 Then Jesus said to them again: Peace be to you. As my Father has sent me, so I send you.
John 20:22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them: Receive the Holy Spirit.

John 20:24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John 20:25 Then the other disciples said to him: We have seen the Lord.

John 20:26 And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas was with them. Then Jesus came, though the doors had been closed, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.
John 20:27 Then he said to Thomas: Reach hither your finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither your hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
John 20:28 And Thomas answered and said to him: My Lord and my God.
John 20:29 Jesus said to him: Because you have seen me you have believed: blessed are they who, though they have not seen, yet have believed. <div eID="gen787" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen788" type="x-p"/>

John 21:1 After this, Jesus showed himself again to his disciples, at the sea of Tiberias. And he showed himself in this way.
John 21:2 There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathaniel of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
John 21:3 Simon Peter said to them: I am going a fishing. They said to him: We also are going with you. They went out and entered the ship; and that night they caught nothing. <div eID="gen789" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen790" type="x-p"/>
John 21:4 But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
John 21:5 Then Jesus said to them: Children, have you any food? They answered him: No.
John 21:6 He said to them: Throw the net on the right side of the ship, and you will find. They threw it, there fore, and were no longer able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
John 21:7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: It is the Lord. And when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded on his outer coat, for he had on his inner garment only, and threw himself into the sea.
John 21:8 And the other disciples came in a little ship, dragging the net with fishes, for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits. <div eID="gen790" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen791" type="x-p"/>
John 21:9 As soon as they had come to the land, they saw there a fire of coals, and fish lying upon it, and bread.
John 21:10 Jesus said to them; Bring of the fish that you have just taken.
John 21:11 Simon Peter went and drew the net to the land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And though they were so many, the net did not break.
John 21:12 Jesus said to them: Come and breakfast. But no one of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? because they knew it was the Lord.
John 21:13 Then Jesus came and took the bread, and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
John 21:14 This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead. <div eID="gen791" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen792" type="x-p"/>
John 21:15 When, therefore, they had taken breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter: Simon, son of Jonah, Do you love me more than these? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my lambs.
John 21:16 He said to him again a second time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Be a shepherd to my sheep.
John 21:17 He said to him a third time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said to him: Feed my sheep.
John 21:18 Verily, verily I say to you, when you were young, you girded yourself, and walked whither you chose; but when you have become old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and lead you whither you would not.
John 21:19 But this he said, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him: Follow me. <div eID="gen792" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen793" type="x-p"/>
John 21:20 Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple that Jesus loved, following, who also reclined at supper upon his breast, and said: Lord, who is he that delivers thee up?
John 21:21 Peter seeing this one, said to Jesus: Lord, what shall this one do?
John 21:22 Jesus said to him: If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? Do you follow me.
John 21:23 Therefore, this saying went out among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? <div eID="gen793" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen794" type="x-p"/>
John 21:24 This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.

Acts 1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one dwell in it, and, His office let another take.

Acts 10:9 And on the morrow, as they were going on their journey, and were drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour.
Acts 10:10 And he became very hungry, and desired to eat; but while they were making ready, he fell into a trance;
Acts 10:11 and he saw heaven opened, and some vessel, like a great sheet, descending, bound by the four corners, and let down to the earth.
Acts 10:12 In this were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
Acts 10:13 And there came a voice to him: Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
Acts 10:14 But Peter said: By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean.
Acts 10:15 And the voice came to him again a second time: What God has cleansed, you must not call common.

Acts 10:19 While Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold, three men ask for you:
Acts 10:20 arise then, and go down, and go with them without hesitation, for I have sent them. <div eID="gen874" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen875" type="x-p"/>

Acts 10:22 They replied: Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among the whole nation of the Jews, was instructed by a holy angel to call you to his house, and to hear words from you.
Acts 10:23 Then he called them in, and lodged them. <div eID="gen875" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen876" type="x-p"/> On the morrow he arose, and went with them; and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
Acts 10:24 And on the next day, they entered Cæsarea And Cornelius was expecting them, and had called together his relatives and near friends.
Acts 10:25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and did him homage.
Acts 10:26 But Peter raised him up, saying: Stand up; I also am a man.
Acts 10:27 And; conversing with him, he went in, and found many that had come together. <div eID="gen876" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen877" type="x-p"/>
Acts 10:28 And he said to them: You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with one of another nation, or to go into his house. But God has showed me that I must not call any man common or unclean.
Acts 10:29 For this reason, when I was sent for, I came without making objection. I ask, therefore, for what purpose have you sent for me?
Acts 10:30 And Cornelius replied: Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and, at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
Acts 10:31 and said: Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your deeds of charity are remembered before God.
Acts 10:32 Send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea; who, when he comes, will speak to you.
Acts 10:33 Therefore, I immediately sent to you; and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are given in charge to you by God. <div eID="gen877" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen878" type="x-p"/>

Acts 10:46 for they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter answered:
Acts 10:47 Can any one forbid the water, that these should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?

Acts 11:6 When I had looked attentively into it, I observed and saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
Acts 11:7 And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
Acts 11:8 But I said, By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.

Acts 13:46 But Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly, said: It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first: but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo! we turn to tho Gentiles.
Acts 13:47 For thus has the Lord given us commandment: I have placed thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be for salvation to the most distant part of the earth. <div eID="gen907" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen908" type="x-p"/>
Acts 13:48 When the Gentiles heard this they rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were determined to obtain eternal life, believed.
Acts 13:49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole of that region.
Acts 13:50 But the Jews in cited the devout and influential women, and the first men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.
Acts 13:51 But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Iconium.

Acts 14:1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude of the Jews and Greeks believed.
Acts 14:2 But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
Acts 14:3 Therefore, they continued a long time, and spoke boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, by granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. <div eID="gen909" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen910" type="x-p"/>
Acts 14:4 But the multitude of the city were divided; and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
Acts 14:5 But when there was a violent purpose on the part of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to outrage and to stone them,
Acts 14:6 being aware of it, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,
Acts 14:7 and there they preached the gospel. <div eID="gen910" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen911" type="x-p"/>
Acts 14:8 And there was a certain man in Lystra, without strength in his feet, who sat, for he was a cripple from his mother’s womb, and had never walked.
Acts 14:9 This man heard Paul speak, who, looking earnestly on him, and seeing that he had faith to be saved,
Acts 14:10 said, with a loud voice: Stand erect upon your feet. And he leaped and walked.
Acts 14:11 When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, and said, in the Lycaonian language: The Gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.
Acts 14:12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, for he was the chief speaker. <div eID="gen911" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen912" type="x-p"/>
Acts 14:13 Then the priest of Jupiter, whose temple was before the city, having brought bulls and garlands to the entrance, intended to offer sacrifice, with the multitudes.
Acts 14:14 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the multitude, crying out,
Acts 14:15 and saying: Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human beings, with passions like your own, and we preach the gospel to you, that you may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them;
Acts 14:16 who, in past generations, permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways;
Acts 14:17 and yet he did not leave himself without testimony, doing good, and giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
Acts 14:18 And with these words they hardly restrained the multitudes from offering sacrifice to them. <div eID="gen912" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen913" type="x-p"/>
Acts 14:19 Then came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, who persuaded the multitudes; and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
Acts 14:20 But while the disciples were standing around him, he arose, and went into the city. <div eID="gen913" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen914" type="x-p"/> And on the next day, he departed with Barnabas to Derbe;
Acts 14:21 and when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,
Acts 14:22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, that through many afflictions we mast enter the kingdom of God.
Acts 14:23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
Acts 14:24 And having passed through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia;
Acts 14:25 and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia:
Acts 14:26 thence they sailed to Antioch, from which place they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had accomplished. <div eID="gen914" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen915" type="x-p"/>
Acts 14:27 And having come and called together the church, they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

Acts 15:1 And certain men came down from Judea, and taught the brethren, saying: Unless you be circumcised, according to the custom of Moses, you can not be saved.
Acts 15:2 Therefore, after Paul and Barnabas had no little dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from among them, should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.
Acts 15:3 Being, therefore, con ducted on their journey by the church, they passed through Phenicia and Samaria, making known the conversion of the Gentiles; and they gave great joy to all the brethren.
Acts 15:4 When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles and elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.
Acts 15:5 But some of the sect of the Pharisees, who believed, arose, saying, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. <div eID="gen916" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen917" type="x-p"/>
Acts 15:6 And the apostles and elders came together to deliberate about this matter.
Acts 15:7 And after there had been much disputing, Peter arose, and said to them: Brethren, you know that, at the beginning, God made choice among us, that, by my mouth, the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe.
Acts 15:8 And God, who knows the heart, became a witness for them, by giving them the Holy Spirit, as he gave it also to us;
Acts 15:9 and he made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
Acts 15:10 Now, therefore, why do you put God to the proof, by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we ourselves, were able to bear?
Acts 15:11 But we believe that we shall be saved, even as they, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. <div eID="gen917" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen918" type="x-p"/>
Acts 15:12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they made known what signs and wonders God had done by them among the Gentiles. <div eID="gen918" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen919" type="x-p"/>
Acts 15:13 And after they were silent, James answered and said: Brethren, hear me;
Acts 15:14 Simeon has declared how God, at the first, did visit the Gentiles, in order to take out from among them a people for his name.
Acts 15:15 And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
Acts 15:16 After this I will return, and build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up;
Acts 15:17 that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things.
Acts 15:18 Known to God from eternity are all bis works.
Acts 15:19 For these reasons, my judgment is, that we give no trouble to those who, from among the Gentiles, have turned to God;
Acts 15:20 but that we write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from lewdness, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
Acts 15:21 For, from ancient times, Moses has, in every city, those who preach him, being read in the synagogue every sabbath-day. <div eID="gen919" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen920" type="x-p"/>
Acts 15:22 Then it pleased the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, chosen men from among themselves; Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren;
Acts 15:23 and they wrote by their hands as follows: <div eID="gen920" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen921" type="x-p"/> The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
Acts 15:24 Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons went out from us and troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, That you must be circumcised, and keep the law, to whom we gave no commandment,
Acts 15:25 it has seemed good to us, having come together with one mind, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Acts 15:26 men who have endangered their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts 15:27 We have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, who will tell you the same things in word.
Acts 15:28 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
Acts 15:29 That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness; from which if you keep yourselves carefully, you will do well. Farewell. <div eID="gen921" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen922" type="x-p"/>
Acts 15:30 So when these men were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and having assembled the multitude, they delivered this letter.
Acts 15:31 When they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation which it gave.
Acts 15:32 And Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and strengthened them.
Acts 15:33 And after spending some time, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren, to those who had sent them.
Acts 15:34 But it pleased Silas to remain there.
Acts 15:35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others, the word of the Lord. <div eID="gen922" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen923" type="x-p"/>
Acts 15:36 And, after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, let us return, and visit our brethren in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
Acts 15:37 And Barnabas determined to take with him John, whose surname was Mark.
Acts 15:38 But Paul did not think it proper to take with them him who had departed from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.
Acts 15:39 There was, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other: and Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus.
Acts 15:40 But Paul chose Silas, and departed, having been commended to the grace of God by the brethren.

Acts 16:1 And he came to Derbe and Lystra; and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess, who was a believer; but his father was a Greek.
Acts 16:2 A good report was given of him by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
Acts 16:3 This man Paul wished to go with him: and he took him and circumcised him, on account of the Jews that were in those places: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts 16:4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been resolved on by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, that they might keep them.
Acts 16:5 Therefore, the churches were established in the faith, and they increased in number daily. <div eID="gen924" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen925" type="x-p"/>
Acts 16:6 When they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,
Acts 16:7 and had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit did not permit them.
Acts 16:8 But having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
Acts 16:9 And, during the night, a vision appeared to Paul. A certain man of Macedonia stood and besought him, saying: Come over to Macedonia and help us.
Acts 16:10 After he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them. <div eID="gen925" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen926" type="x-p"/>
Acts 16:11 Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came by a straight course to Samothracia, and, on the following day, to Neapolis,
Acts 16:12 and thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony. We remained in that city some days:
Acts 16:13 and on the sabbath-day we went out of the city to the side of a river, where, as usual, was the house of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
Acts 16:14 And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things that were spoken by Paul.
Acts 16:15 And when she and her household had been immersed, she besought us, saying: If you judge me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and make it your home. And she con strained us. <div eID="gen926" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen927" type="x-p"/>
Acts 16:16 And it came to pass, that as we were going to the house of prayer, there met us a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of Python, who brought much gain to her masters, by giving responses.
Acts 16:17 She followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the most High God, who show us the way of salvation.
Acts 16:18 And this she continued to do for many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit: I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. <div eID="gen927" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen928" type="x-p"/>
Acts 16:19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the market to the rulers.
Acts 16:20 And having brought them to the magistrates, they said: These men, who are Jews, do greatly trouble our city;
Acts 16:21 and they teach customs which it is not lawful for us, who are Romans, to receive or to observe.
Acts 16:22 And the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates stripped off their clothes, and gave command to beat them with rods.
Acts 16:23 And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, and charged the jailer to keep them securely.
Acts 16:24 And having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks. <div eID="gen928" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen929" type="x-p"/>
Acts 16:25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sung a hymn to God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
Acts 16:26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bonds were loosed.
Acts 16:27 And the jailer, being aroused from sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
Acts 16:28 But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying: Do yourself no harm, for we are all here. <div eID="gen929" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen930" type="x-p"/>
Acts 16:29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas;
Acts 16:30 and, having brought them out, he said: Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Acts 16:31 They replied: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your house shall be saved.
Acts 16:32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in his house.
Acts 16:33 And he took them at that hour of the night, and washed the blood from their stripes; and he was immersed, himself and all his, immediately.
Acts 16:34 And he brought them into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God, with all his house. <div eID="gen930" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen931" type="x-p"/>
Acts 16:35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying: Release those men.
Acts 16:36 And the jailer told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to release you. Now, therefore, come out, and go in peace.
Acts 16:37 But Paul said to them: Having publicly scourged us uncondemned, us who are Romans, they threw us into prison: and do they now put us out secretly? No, verily: but let them come and lead us out.
Acts 16:38 And the lictors told these words to the magistrates: and they were alarmed when they heard that they were Romans;
Acts 16:39 and they came, and entreated them, and led them out, and requested them to depart from the city.
Acts 16:40 And having come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.  <chapter eID="Acts.16"/> <div eID="gen931" type="x-p"/>

Acts 17:1 And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts 17:2 And Paul, according to his custom, went in to them, and, for three sabbath-days, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
Acts 17:3 explaining and affirming that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.
Acts 17:4 And some of them believed, and associated themselves with Paul and Silas; of the devout Greeks, a great multitude, and of the chief women, not a few. <div eID="gen932" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen933" type="x-p"/>
Acts 17:5 But the unbelieving Jews, taking with them some evil men, who were loungers about the markets, and collecting a mob, set the city in an uproar; and having assaulted the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.
Acts 17:6 But not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying out: These men, who have thrown the world into confusion, have come hither also;
Acts 17:7 whom Jason has received into his house: and they all act in opposition to the decrees of Cæsar, saying, That there is another king, Jesus.
Acts 17:8 And the multitude, and the rulers of the city, were troubled when they heard these things.
Acts 17:9 And they took security of Jason, and of the others, and let them go. <div eID="gen933" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen934" type="x-p"/>
Acts 17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea; and when they had come, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts 17:11 These were of a better disposition than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
Acts 17:12 Therefore, many of them believed; both of influential women, who were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
Acts 17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea also, they came thither, and excited the multitude.
Acts 17:14 Then the brethren immediately sent Paul away, to go as if to the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
Acts 17:15 And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and having received a commandment for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they departed. <div eID="gen934" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen935" type="x-p"/>
Acts 17:16 Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the city full of idols.
Acts 17:17 Accordingly, he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and in the market daily, with those who chanced to meet him.
Acts 17:18 And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers disputed with him; and some said: What can this babbler possibly wish to say? Others said: He seems to be a proclaimer of strange demons: for he preached to them Jesus and the Resurrection.
Acts 17:19 And they took him, and brought him to Mars hill, saying: Are we able to understand what this new teaching is, which is announced by you?
Acts 17:20 For you bring some strange things to our ears: we wish to understand then what these things mean.
Acts 17:21 For all the Athenians and resident strangers have leisure for nothing else than to tell or to hear some new thing. <div eID="gen935" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen936" type="x-p"/>
Acts 17:22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said: Men of Athens, I perceive that in all respects your reverence for demons excels that of other men.
Acts 17:23 For as I was passing through, and looking attentively at the objects of your worship, I dis covered also an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him I make known to you.
Acts 17:24 God, who made the world, and all things that are in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;
Acts 17:25 nor is he ministered to by the hands of men, as if he needed any thing: for he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things:
Acts 17:26 and he has made from one blood every nation of men, that they might dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out their appointed times, and the bounds of their dwelling:
Acts 17:27 that they might seek for God, if perhaps they would feel after him, and find him, although, indeed, he is not far from every one of us.
Acts 17:28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as also some of your own poets have said: For we his offspring are. <div eID="gen936" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen937" type="x-p"/>
Acts 17:29 Therefore, being the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhood is like gold, or silver, or stone, sculptured by art and the device of man.
Acts 17:30 Yet the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now, he commands all men everywhere to repent:
Acts 17:31 because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world, in righteousness, by the man whom he has chosen, giving to all assurance of this, by having raised him from the dead. <div eID="gen937" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen938" type="x-p"/>

Acts 18:3 and because he was of the same trade, he made his home with them, and worked: for by trade they were tent-makers.
Acts 18:4 But on every sabbath, he reasoned in the synagogue, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
Acts 18:5 And when Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul was roused in spirit, and earnestly testified to the Jews, that the Christ was Jesus. <div eID="gen939" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen940" type="x-p"/>

Acts 18:8 But Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were immersed.
Acts 18:9 And the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision in the night: Fear not; but speak, and be not silent;
Acts 18:10 for I am with you, and no one shall make an assault upon you, to injure you; for I have many people in this city.

Acts 18:12 But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one mind, suddenly came upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat,
Acts 18:13 saying: This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
Acts 18:14 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were a matter of injustice, or of wicked mischief, O Jews, I would, with reason, bear with you:
Acts 18:15 but if it is a question about a word, and names, and your law, see to it yourselves: for I will not be a judge of these tilings.
Acts 18:16 And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
Acts 18:17 And all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things. <div eID="gen941" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen942" type="x-p"/>

Acts 18:22 and having landed at Cæsarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

Acts 18:24 And a certain Jew, named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
Acts 18:25 He was instructed in the way of the Lord; and, being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.
Acts 18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him, and taught him the way of God more accurately.
Acts 18:27 And when he wished to pass into Achaia, the brethren, exhorting him, wrote to the disciples to receive him. And when he had come, he gave much help to the believers, through the grace conferred on him.
Acts 18:28 For, with great strength, he utterly confounded the Jews publicly, showing, by the Scriptures, that the Christ was Jesus.  <chapter eID="Acts.18"/> <div eID="gen943" type="x-p"/>

Acts 19:1 And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, after passing through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,
Acts 19:2 said to them: Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? They said to him: <transChange type="added">We have not only not received it,</transChange> but we have not even heard whether the Holy Spirit is given.
Acts 19:3 And he said to them: Into what, then, were you immersed? They replied: Into John’s immersion.
Acts 19:4 And Paul said: John immersed with the immersion of repentance, saying to the people, that they must believe on him who should come after him, that is, on the Christ, Jesus.
Acts 19:5 And when they heard this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts 19:6 And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
Acts 19:7 And all the men were about twelve. <div eID="gen944" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen945" type="x-p"/>
Acts 19:8 And he entered the synagogue, and spoke boldly, reasoning, and persuading them for three months, with respect to the things of the kingdom of God.
Acts 19:9 But as some were hardened, and did not believe, and spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he withdrew from them, and separated the disciples, and discoursed daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
Acts 19:10 This continued for two years; so that all that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts 19:11 Mighty deeds, also, that were unusual, did God perform by the hands of Paul;
Acts 19:12 so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them. <div eID="gen945" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen946" type="x-p"/>
Acts 19:13 And some of the roving Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying: I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.
Acts 19:14 And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
Acts 19:15 But the evil spirit answered and said: Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know; but who are you?
Acts 19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled from that house, naked and wounded.
Acts 19:17 And this became known to all the Greeks and Jews that dwelt in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Acts 19:18 And many of those who believed came and confessed, and made known their practices.
Acts 19:19 And many of those who practiced magic, brought together their books, and burned them, in the presence of all. And they computed their value, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts 19:20 So mightily did the word of the Lord grow and prevail. <div eID="gen946" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen947" type="x-p"/>
Acts 19:21 When these things had been accomplished, Paul purposed in spirit to go to Jerusalem, after he should pass through Macedonia and Achaia, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.
Acts 19:22 So, having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he remained for a time in Asia. <div eID="gen947" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen948" type="x-p"/>
Acts 19:23 And at that time there was no little excitement about that way.
Acts 19:24 For a certain man, named Demetrius, a silversmith, by making silver shrines for Diana, furnished no little trade to the artists.
Acts 19:25 These he called together, with the workmen employed about such things, and said: Men, you know that our wealth arises from this trade:
Acts 19:26 and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost the whole of Asia, this Paul, by his persuasions, has drawn away a great multitude, saying, that they which are made with hands are not gods.
Acts 19:27 Now there is danger, not only that this our calling will come into disgrace, but that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised, and that the majesty of her whom all Asia and the world worships, will be destroyed. <div eID="gen948" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen949" type="x-p"/>
Acts 19:28 When they heard this, they were full of anger, and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
Acts 19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion. And they seized Gains and Aristarchus, who were Macedonians, Paul’s fellow-travelers, and, with one consent, rushed into the theater.
Acts 19:30 And when Paul wished to go in among the people, the disciples did not permit him.
Acts 19:31 Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friendly to him, sent to him, and besought him not to trust himself into the theater.
Acts 19:32 Some, therefore, were crying one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what they had come together.
Acts 19:33 And some of the multitude put Alexander forward, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander waved his hand, and wished to make a defense to the people.
Acts 19:34 But perceiving that he was a Jew, they all cried out, with one voice, for about two hours: Great is Diana of the Ephesians. <div eID="gen949" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen950" type="x-p"/>
Acts 19:35 But the town-clerk quieted the multitude, and said: Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Diana, and of the image that fell down from Jupiter?
Acts 19:36 As these things, then, can not be contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and do nothing rashly.
Acts 19:37 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples, nor revilers of your goddess.
Acts 19:38 Therefore, if Demetrius, and the artists who are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are in session, and the proconsuls are there; let them accuse each other.
Acts 19:39 But if you have any inquiries to make about other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
Acts 19:40 For we are in danger of being called to answer for this day’s tumult, since there is no cause by which we shall be able to account for this concourse.
Acts 19:41 And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.  <chapter eID="Acts.19"/> <div eID="gen950" type="x-p"/>

Acts 20:1 After the tumult had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, and bade them farewell, and departed, in order to go into Macedonia.
Acts 20:2 And when he had gone through those regions, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece.
Acts 20:3 And having remained there three months, he determined to return through Macedonia, because a plot had been laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail to Syria.
Acts 20:4 And Sopater of Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus, who were Asiatics, accompanied him to Asia.
Acts 20:5 These went before, and waited for us at Troas.
Acts 20:6 But we sailed from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we remained seven days. <div eID="gen951" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen952" type="x-p"/>
Acts 20:7 And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, intending to depart on the morrow; and he continued his speech till midnight.
Acts 20:8 And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which they had met together.
Acts 20:9 And a certain young man, named Eutychus, was sitting in the window, overpowered with deep sleep: and, as Paul was discoursing a long time, being oppressed with sleep, he fell from the third story, and was taken up dead.
Acts 20:10 But Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his life is in him.
Acts 20:11 And he went up again, and broke bread, and ate; and having conversed a long time, till daylight, he thus departed.
Acts 20:12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. <div eID="gen952" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen953" type="x-p"/>
Acts 20:13 And we went on before to the ship, and put to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul on board at that place; for he had so directed, intending to go himself on foot.
Acts 20:14 And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board, and came to Mitylene;
Acts 20:15 and sailing from that place, we came, on the following day, opposite to Chios; and, on the next day, we arrived at Samos: and after stopping at Trogyllium, we came, on the next day, to Miletus.
Acts 20:16 For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not spend time in Asia; for he hastened, that, if it were possible for him, he might be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. <div eID="gen953" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen954" type="x-p"/>
Acts 20:17 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
Acts 20:18 And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day on which I came into Asia, how I have been with you during the whole time,
Acts 20:19 serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials, which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
Acts 20:20 and that I have kept back nothing that was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you both publicly, and from house to house,
Acts 20:21 bearing full testimony both to Jews and to Greeks, of the repentance that leads to God, and of the faith that leads to our Lord Jesus Christ. <div eID="gen954" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen955" type="x-p"/>
Acts 20:22 And now, behold, I am going, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what shall befall me there,
Acts 20:23 except that in every city the Holy Spirit testifies to me, saying, That bonds and afflictions await me.
Acts 20:24 But I esteem this a matter of no importance, nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry that I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.
Acts 20:25 And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
Acts 20:26 For this reason I solemnly affirm to you this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men.
Acts 20:27 For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. <div eID="gen955" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen956" type="x-p"/>
Acts 20:28 Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, that you be shepherds to the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.
Acts 20:29 For I know this, that, after my departure, rapacious wolves will enter in among you, who will not spare the flock;
Acts 20:30 and men will arise from among yourselves, speaking perverse things, that they may draw off disciples after them.
Acts 20:31 Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, by day and by night, I ceased not to warn every one of you with tears.
Acts 20:32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace; to Him who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified.
Acts 20:33 I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
Acts 20:34 You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.
Acts 20:35 In all things I have taught you by example, that by thus laboring, you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus; for he himself said, It is more blessed to give, than to receive. <div eID="gen956" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen957" type="x-p"/>
Acts 20:36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
Acts 20:37 And they all wept much, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,

Acts 21:2 And finding a ship that was going to Phenicia, we embarked, and put to sea.
Acts 21:3 And we came in view of Cyprus; and, leaving it to the left, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to put off her lading.
Acts 21:4 And we remained there seven days, after finding the disciples. These urged Paul, by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts 21:5 And when these days were completed, we went forth, and continued our journey, they all, with their wives and children, conducting us out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
Acts 21:6 And when we had bid each other farewell, we embarked, and they returned home. <div eID="gen958" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen959" type="x-p"/>

Acts 21:8 On the following day we departed, and came to Cæsarea, and went into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven; and we remained with him.
Acts 21:9 This man had four virgin daughters, who had the gift of prophesy. <div eID="gen959" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen960" type="x-p"/>
Acts 21:10 And as we remained there many days, there came down, from Judea, a certain prophet, named Agabus;
Acts 21:11 and he came to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own hands and feet, and said: Thus says the Holy Spirit; the Jews that are in Jerusalem will so bind the man to whom this girdle belongs; and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Acts 21:12 And when we heard these things, we, and those of that place also, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts 21:13 But Paul answered: What do you effect by weeping, and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not only to be bound, but also to suffer death in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts 21:14 And as he would not be persuaded, we kept silence, and said: The will of the Lord be done. <div eID="gen960" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen961" type="x-p"/>
Acts 21:15 And after these days we prepared for our journey, and went up to Jerusalem.

Acts 21:17 And when we came to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
Acts 21:18 And, on the following day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
Acts 21:19 And when he had saluted them, he related, in every particular, the things which. God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry. <div eID="gen962" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen963" type="x-p"/>
Acts 21:20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him: You see, brother, how many myriads of the Jews there are that believe, and they are all zealous for the law.
Acts 21:21 And they have heard it reported of you, that you teach all the Jews that are among the Gentiles to apostatize from Moses; commanding them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.
Acts 21:22 What, then, is to be done? A multitude must certainly come together; for they will hear that you have come.
Acts 21:23 Do, therefore, this which we advise you. We have four men who have a vow on them.
Acts 21:24 Take them, and join with them in their vow of abstinence, and pay their expenses, in order that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard reported of you are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.
Acts 21:25 But with respect to the Gentiles that believe, we have written; having decided that they should observe no such thing; but that they keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness. <div eID="gen963" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen964" type="x-p"/>
Acts 21:26 Then Paul took the men, and, on the following day, joining in their vow of abstinence, he entered the temple, and gave notice when the days of abstinence would be completed, at which time an offering should be made for each of them. <div eID="gen964" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen965" type="x-p"/>
Acts 21:27 And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the multitude into confusion, and laid their hands on him,
Acts 21:28 crying out: Men of Israel, help! this is the man who teaches all men every where against this people, and the law, and this place: and besides, he has even brought Greeks into the temple, and defiled this holy place.
Acts 21:29 For, before this time, they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.
Acts 21:30 And the whole city was moved; and the people ran together, and, seizing Paul, they dragged him out of the temple, and the gates were immediately closed. <div eID="gen965" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen966" type="x-p"/>
Acts 21:31 And while they were seeking to kill him, report was brought to the officer of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem was in an uproar.
Acts 21:32 And he immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. When they saw the officer and the soldiers, they ceased beating Paul.
Acts 21:33 Then the officer came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
Acts 21:34 And some in the multitude cried out one thing, and some another. But not being able to obtain any certain knowledge on account of the tumult, he commanded him to be led into the fortress.
Acts 21:35 And when he was on the steps, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the multitude.
Acts 21:36 For the greater part of the people followed, crying out: Away with him! <div eID="gen966" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen967" type="x-p"/>
Acts 21:37 But as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the officer: May I speak to you? He replied: Do you understand Greek?
Acts 21:38 Are you not that Egyptian, who, before these days, made an insurrection, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men of the Assassins?
Acts 21:39 But Paul replied: I am a Jew of Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no unknown city; and I beseech you, permit me to speak to the people.
Acts 21:40 And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing upon the steps, waved his hand to the people. And when there was great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:  <chapter eID="Acts.21"/> <div eID="gen967" type="x-p"/>

Acts 22:1 Brethren and fathers, hear my defense, which I now make before you.
Acts 22:2 When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept the greater silence. And he said:
Acts 22:3 I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, yet educated in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the strict discipline of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as you all are this day.
Acts 22:4 And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,
Acts 22:5 as the chief priest and the whole body of elders will testify for me. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring those, also, who were there, bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished. <div eID="gen968" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen969" type="x-p"/>
Acts 22:6 But it came to pass, that, as I was on my journey, and was drawing near to Damascus, about midday, there suddenly shone from heaven a great light round about me;
Acts 22:7 and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
Acts 22:8 And I answered, Who art thou Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.
Acts 22:9 They who were with me saw the light, and were afraid, but did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me.
Acts 22:10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus, and there you shall be told of all things that are appointed for you to do. <div eID="gen969" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen970" type="x-p"/>
Acts 22:11 And as I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and went into Damascus.
Acts 22:12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, who had a good report from all the Jews that dwelt there,
Acts 22:13 came to me, and standing by me, said, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked upon him.
Acts 22:14 And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice of his mouth;
Acts 22:15 for you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
Acts 22:16 And now, why do you delay? Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord. <div eID="gen970" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen971" type="x-p"/>
Acts 22:17 And it came to pass, after I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance,
Acts 22:18 and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.
Acts 22:19 And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I threw into prison, and scourged, in every synagogue, those who believed on thee;
Acts 22:20 and that when the blood of Stephen, thy witness, was shed, I also stood by and approved, and kept the clothing of those who slew him.
Acts 22:21 And he said to me, Depart, for I will send you far off to the Gentiles. <div eID="gen971" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen972" type="x-p"/>
Acts 22:22 And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such a man from the earth! for it is not fit that he should live.
Acts 22:23 And as they were crying out, and tossing off their clothes, and throwing dust into the air,
Acts 22:24 the officer commanded him to be led into the fortress, and gave orders that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so cried out against him.
Acts 22:25 But Paul said to the centurion who stood by, as he caused him to be bent forward to the straps: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?
Acts 22:26 And when the centurion heard that, he went out and told it to the officer, saying: What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.
Acts 22:27 And the officer came and said to him: Tell me, are you a Roman? He answered: Yes.
Acts 22:28 And the officer answered: With a great Bum did I purchase this citizenship. And Paul replied: But I was born a citizen.
Acts 22:29 Then, those who were about to examine him, immediately departed from him. And the officer was afraid, when he learned that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. <div eID="gen972" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen973" type="x-p"/>
Acts 22:30 And, on the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrim to meet together. And he brought Paul down, and placed him before them.  <chapter eID="Acts.22"/> <div eID="gen973" type="x-p"/>

Acts 23:1 And Paul, looking earnestly upon the Sanhedrim, said: Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience toward God to this day.
Acts 23:2 And the chief priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by to smite him on the mouth.
Acts 23:3 Then Paul said to him: God will smite you, you whitened wall! for do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet violate the law by commanding me to be smitten?
Acts 23:4 And those who stood by said: Do you revile God’s chief priest?
Acts 23:5 And Paul replied: I did not know, brethren, that he was the chief priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people. <div eID="gen974" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen975" type="x-p"/>
Acts 23:6 But when Paul perceived that one part belonged to the Sadducees, and the other to the Pharisees, he cried out, in the Sanhedrim: Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I judged.
Acts 23:7 And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.
Acts 23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection; neither angel nor spirit: but the Pharisees acknowledge both. And there arose a great clamor. And the scribes, on the part of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying:
Acts 23:9 We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
Acts 23:10 And when there arose a great dissension, the officer, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the fortress. <div eID="gen975" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen976" type="x-p"/>
Acts 23:11 And on the following night, the Lord stood by him, and said: Take courage; for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you testify also in Rome. <div eID="gen976" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen977" type="x-p"/>
Acts 23:12 And when it was day, the Jews combined together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
Acts 23:13 And there were more than forty who formed this conspiracy.
Acts 23:14 And they went to the chief priests and elders, and said: We have surely bound ourselves under a curse, that we will taste nothing till we have killed Paul.
Acts 23:15 Now, therefore, do you, together with the Sanhedrim, give notice to the officer, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as if you intended to inquire more accurately into the matters concerning him: and before he comes near, we are ready to kill him. <div eID="gen977" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen978" type="x-p"/>
Acts 23:16 But the son of Paul’s sister heard of the plot, and he went and entered the fortress, and told Paul.
Acts 23:17 And Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said: Conduct this young man to the officer, for he has something to tell him.
Acts 23:18 So he took him, and led him to the officer, and said: The prisoner Paul called me to him, and requested me to conduct this young man to you; for he has something to tell you.
Acts 23:19 And the officer took him by the hand, and went aside with him privately, and inquired: What is it that you have to tell me?
Acts 23:20 He answered: The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down into the Sanhedrim to-morrow, as if they intended to inquire something more accurately concerning him.
Acts 23:21 Do not, however, be persuaded by them; for more than forty men of them are lying in wait for him; and they have bound themselves under a curse, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for a promise from you.
Acts 23:22 Then the officer sent the young man away, with this charge: Tell no one that you have made these things known to me. <div eID="gen978" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen979" type="x-p"/>
Acts 23:23 And he called to him two centurions, and said: Make ready two hundred soldiers, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, that they may depart to Cæsarea at the third hour of the night.
Acts 23:24 And provide beasts on which they may set Paul, and take him in safety to Felix the governor.
Acts 23:25 And he wrote a letter in this form:
Acts 23:26 Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:
Acts 23:27 This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them. Then I went with soldiers, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
Acts 23:28 But wishing to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrim.
Acts 23:29 And I found that he was accused about questions of their law, but had nothing worthy of death or of bonds charged against him.
Acts 23:30 And as I was informed that a plot was about to be laid against the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, and commanded his accusers to say in your presence what they had against him. Farewell. <div eID="gen979" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen980" type="x-p"/>
Acts 23:31 Then the soldiers took Paul, as they were commanded, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Acts 23:32 And, on the morrow, they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the fortress.
Acts 23:33 When they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
Acts 23:34 And when he had read the letter, he inquired to what province he belonged. And learning that he was from Cilicia, he said: I will hear you when your accusers also have come. And he ordered him to be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.  <chapter eID="Acts.23"/> <div eID="gen980" type="x-p"/>

Acts 24:1 And after five days, Ananias the chief priest came down with the elders and a certain orator, Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.
Acts 24:2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
Acts 24:3 Since through you we enjoy great quietness, and since whatever has been undertaken for this nation has been conducted to a successful issue by your foresight at all times and in all places, we accept it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
Acts 24:4 But that I may not detain you longer, I beseech you to hear us, in your clemency, a few words.
Acts 24:5 For we have found this man a pest and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
Acts 24:6 He also attempted to profane the temple; and we took him, and wished to judge him according to our law.
Acts 24:7 But Lysias the officer came, and, with much violence, took him out of our hands,
Acts 24:8 and commanded his accusers to come before you. From him you may be able yourself, by examination, to gain a knowledge of all these tilings of which we accuse him. <div eID="gen981" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen982" type="x-p"/>
Acts 24:9 And the Jews united in accusing him, saying that these things were so. <div eID="gen982" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen983" type="x-p"/>
Acts 24:10 Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: Knowing that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully offer a defense for myself:
Acts 24:11 for you can understand that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
Acts 24:12 And they found me neither disputing with any one in the temple, nor exciting the multitude in the synagogue, or in the city:
Acts 24:13 nor are they able to prove the things of which they now accuse me.
Acts 24:14 But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call sect, so do I worship the God of my fathers; believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets;
Acts 24:15 having hope in God, which they themselves also admit, that I there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.
Acts 24:16 And I do exercise myself in this, always to have a conscience void of offense toward God and man. <div eID="gen983" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen984" type="x-p"/>
Acts 24:17 But, after many years, I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and offerings.
Acts 24:18 While engaged in these things, certain Jews from Asia found me fulfilling my vow of abstinence in the temple, not with a multitude, nor with tumult.
Acts 24:19 These ought to be here before you, and bring their charge, if they have any, against me.
Acts 24:20 Or let these persons here say, what offensive conduct they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrim,
Acts 24:21 except in this one expression, which I uttered while standing among them: With respect to the resurrection I of the dead, I am judged by you this day. <div eID="gen984" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen985" type="x-p"/>
Acts 24:22 But Felix, having a more accurate knowledge of this way, put them off, and said: When Lysias the officer comes down, I will inquire fully into your matters.
Acts 24:23 And he commanded the centurion to keep him under guard, and to relax the rigor of his confinement, and to forbid no one of his friends to minister or to come to him. <div eID="gen985" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen986" type="x-p"/>
Acts 24:24 And, after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
Acts 24:25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered: For the present withdraw; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.
Acts 24:26 He hoped, at the same time, that money would have been given him by Paul, to release him. For this reason, he sent for him very frequently, and conversed with him. <div eID="gen986" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen987" type="x-p"/>
Acts 24:27 But, after two years, Felix received Portius Festus as his successor; and Felix, wishing to confer a favor on the Jews, left Paul bound.  <chapter eID="Acts.24"/> <div eID="gen987" type="x-p"/>

Acts 25:1 When Festus, having entered upon his government, after three days went up from Cæsarea to Jerusalem.
Acts 25:2 And the chief priest and first men of the Jews informed him against Paul,
Acts 25:3 and, asking a favor against him, besought him that he would send and have him brought to Jerusalem, laying a plot to kill him on the road.
Acts 25:4 Then Festus answered, that Paul was under guard in Cæsarea, and that he himself would soon depart thither.
Acts 25:5 Therefore, said he, let those among you who are men of influence, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him. <div eID="gen988" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen989" type="x-p"/>
Acts 25:6 And he remained among them not more than eight or ten days, and then went down to Cæsarea And, on the next day, he sat upon the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.
Acts 25:7 And when he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around, and brought many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove,
Acts 25:8 he answering for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cæsar, have I committed any offense.
Acts 25:9 But Festus, willing to confer a favor on the Jews, answered Paul, and said: Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?
Acts 25:10 And Paul answered: I am standing at the judgment-seat of Cæsar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.
Acts 25:11 If, however, I be an offender, and have done any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if the things of which these men accuse me are nothing, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Cæsar.
Acts 25:12 Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered: To Cæsar have you appealed? To Cæsar you shall go. <div eID="gen989" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen990" type="x-p"/>
Acts 25:13 And after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Cæsarea, to salute Festus.
Acts 25:14 And as they remained there many days, Festus made known to the king the facts concerning Paul, saying: There is a certain man, who was left in bonds by Felix,
Acts 25:15 concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, asking for judgment against him.
Acts 25:16 I replied to them, that it is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man up to death, before the accused has had his accusers face to face, and has had an opportunity to answer concerning the charge that is against him.
Acts 25:17 Therefore, when they had come hither with me, I made no delay; but, on the next day, sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
Acts 25:18 And when his accusers stood up, they brought no such charge against him as I expected;
Acts 25:19 but they had certain questions against him, about their own religion, and about a certain Jesus that had died, who, Paul affirmed, was alive.
Acts 25:20 But, being in doubt about the question concerning this man, I asked him if he would go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged with respect to these matters.
Acts 25:21 But when Paul made his appeal, that he should be kept for the judgment of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I could send him to Cæsar <div eID="gen990" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen991" type="x-p"/>
Acts 25:22 And Agrippa said to Festus: I could wish to have heard the man myself. He replied: To-morrow you shall hear him. <div eID="gen991" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen992" type="x-p"/>
Acts 25:23 Therefore, on the morrow, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and entered the place of audience, with the officers and principal men of the city, Paul, at the command of Festus, was brought forth.
Acts 25:24 And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all men here present, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews, both in Jerusalem and in this place, have entreated me, crying out, that he ought to live no longer.
Acts 25:25 But finding that he had done nothing worthy of death, and as he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
Acts 25:26 Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. For this reason, I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after the examination has been held, I may have something to write.
Acts 25:27 For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to make known the charges that are against him.  <chapter eID="Acts.25"/> <div eID="gen992" type="x-p"/>

Acts 26:1 Then Agrippa said to Paul: You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and answered for himself. <div eID="gen993" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen994" type="x-p"/>
Acts 26:2 I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall this day make my defense before you, concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews;
Acts 26:3 especially, since you are acquainted with all the customs and questions that are among the Jews. For this reason, I beseech you to hear me patiently. <div eID="gen994" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen995" type="x-p"/>
Acts 26:4 My course of life from my youth, which, from the beginning, was among my own nation in Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
Acts 26:5 who, knowing me from the first, could testify, if they would, that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
Acts 26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
Acts 26:7 to which promise our twelve tribes, zealously serving night and day, hope to come: on account of which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
Acts 26:8 What? Is it thought a thing incredible among you, that God raises the dead? <div eID="gen995" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen996" type="x-p"/>
Acts 26:9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.
Acts 26:10 And this I did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against them.
Acts 26:11 And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to speak impiously; and, being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities. <div eID="gen996" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen997" type="x-p"/>
Acts 26:12 While I was engaged in these things, and was going to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
Acts 26:13 at midday, while I was on the road, I saw, O King, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.
Acts 26:14 And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying, in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
Acts 26:15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? He replied, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
Acts 26:16 But arise, and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness of the things which you have seen, and of those in which I will appear to you,
Acts 26:17 delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,
Acts 26:18 in order to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among the sanctified, by faith in me. <div eID="gen997" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen998" type="x-p"/>
Acts 26:19 Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;
Acts 26:20 but announced first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works worthy of repentance.
Acts 26:21 For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple, and endeavored to kill me.
Acts 26:22 Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I have stood till this day, testifying both to small and to great, saying nothing else than the things which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:
Acts 26:23 that Christ should suffer, and that he first, by his resurrection from the dead, should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles. <div eID="gen998" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen999" type="x-p"/>
Acts 26:24 And as he spoke these things in his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice; Paul, you are mad; much learning drives you to madness.
Acts 26:25 But he replied: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
Acts 26:26 For the king has knowledge of these things, before whom, also, I speak with boldness; for I am persuaded that none of these things have escaped his notice; for this was not done in a corner.
Acts 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.
Acts 26:28 Then Agrippa said to Paul: You almost persuade me to be a Christian.
Acts 26:29 And Paul replied: I could pray to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me to-day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. <div eID="gen999" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1000" type="x-p"/>
Acts 26:30 And the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.
Acts 26:31 And when they had withdrawn, they conversed with one another, saying: This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
Acts 26:32 And Agrippa said to Festus: This man could have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cæsar  <chapter eID="Acts.26"/> <div eID="gen1000" type="x-p"/>

Acts 27:1 And as it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan band, named Julius.
Acts 27:2 And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, intending to sail by the coast of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
Acts 27:3 On the next day, we touched at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with kindness, and permitted him to go to his friends, and receive their attentions.
Acts 27:4 And thence we put to sea, and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were adverse.
Acts 27:5 And when we had sailed across the sea opposite Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. <div eID="gen1001" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1002" type="x-p"/>
Acts 27:6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy; and he put us on board.
Acts 27:7 For many days we sailed slowly; and having with difficulty come off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone:
Acts 27:8 and coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which is the city of Lasea. <div eID="gen1002" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1003" type="x-p"/>
Acts 27:9 But, after much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous, for the fast was already past, Paul admonished them,
Acts 27:10 saying: Men, I perceive that this voyage will be with damage and much loss, not only to the cargo and the ship, but also to our lives.
Acts 27:11 But the centurion had more confidence in the pilot, and in the owner of the ship, than in the things which were spoken by Paul.
Acts 27:12 And as the harbor was not commodious to winter in, the majority advised that they should put to sea from that place also, if, by any means, they might reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a harbor of Crete, lying toward the south-west and north-west. <div eID="gen1003" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1004" type="x-p"/>
Acts 27:13 And when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had gained their object, they launched the ship, and ran along close to the shore of Crete.
Acts 27:14 But in a little time a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon, blew against it.
Acts 27:15 And the ship being caught and unable to bear up against the wind, we committed it to the gale, and were driven along.
Acts 27:16 And running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we with difficulty secured the boat.
Acts 27:17 When they had taken it up, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the quicksand, they lowered the mast, and thus were driven along.
Acts 27:18 And as we were greatly tossed by the tempest, on the next day they threw overboard the cargo;
Acts 27:19 and on the third day, with our own hands, we threw out the tackling of the ship.
Acts 27:20 And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay upon us, all hope of our being saved was at length taken away. <div eID="gen1004" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1005" type="x-p"/>
Acts 27:21 But, after long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them, and said: men, you ought to have been persuaded by me, and not to have put to sea from Crete; and you would have avoided this damage and loss.
Acts 27:22 And now, I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
Acts 27:23 For there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
Acts 27:24 and said, Fear not, Paul; you must stand in the presence of Cæsar; and behold, God has given you all that are sailing with you.
Acts 27:25 For this reason, men, be cheerful; for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told to me.

Acts 27:27 But when the fourteenth night had come, and we were drifting up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors supposed that they were drawing near some land.
Acts 27:28 And they sounded, and found twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, and sounded again, they found fifteen fathoms.
Acts 27:29 And fearing that we would fall upon rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern, and wished for day. <div eID="gen1006" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1007" type="x-p"/>
Acts 27:30 And as the sailors were attempting to flee from the ship, and were letting down the boat into the sea, under the pretext that they were about to let down anchors from the prow,
Acts 27:31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers: Unless these remain in the ship, you can not be saved.
Acts 27:32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off. <div eID="gen1007" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1008" type="x-p"/>
Acts 27:33 And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying: This is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense, and continued without food, having taken nothing.
Acts 27:34 Wherefore, I exhort you to take food; for this will promote your safety. For not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.
Acts 27:35 And when he had said this, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all, and broke, and began to eat.
Acts 27:36 And all became cheerful, and also partook of food.
Acts 27:37 And all of us that were in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six souls.
Acts 27:38 When they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship by throwing the provisions into the sea. <div eID="gen1008" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1009" type="x-p"/>
Acts 27:39 And when it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they perceived an inlet, that had an accessible shore, into which they desired, if they could, to thrust the ship.
Acts 27:40 And, after cutting away the anchors, they committed the ship to the sea, at the same time loosing the lashings of the rudders: and they set up the front sail to the wind, and kept the ship firmly toward the shore.
Acts 27:41 And falling into a place where two currents met, they ran the ship aground, and the prow stuck fast, and remained immovable; but the stern was broken by the violence of the waves.
Acts 27:42 The soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest some of them should swim out and escape.
Acts 27:43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, to throw themselves into the sea first, and get to land;
Acts 27:44 and then the rest, some on planks, and others on what could be taken from the ship. And thus it came to pass, that all got safe to land.  <chapter eID="Acts.27"/> <div eID="gen1009" type="x-p"/>

Acts 28:1 And when they had saved themselves, they then learned that the island was called Melita.
Acts 28:2 And the barbarians showed us no ordinary kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the rain which was falling, and because of the cold. <div eID="gen1010" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1011" type="x-p"/>
Acts 28:3 And when Paul had brought together a heap of brushwood, and laid it on the fire, a viper came out, by reason of the heat, and fastened itself on his hand.
Acts 28:4 And when the barbarians saw the reptile hanging from his hand, they said to one another: This man is certainly a murderer, whom, although he has saved himself from the sea, justice does not permit to live.
Acts 28:5 Then he shook the reptile from him into the fire, and suffered no harm.
Acts 28:6 But they were expecting that he would become inflamed and swollen, or would suddenly fall down dead; yet, after expecting it for a long time, and seeing no harm befall him, they changed their mind, and said he was a god. <div eID="gen1011" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1012" type="x-p"/>
Acts 28:7 Among the estates about that place were those of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who took us to his house, and, for three days, entertained us kindly.
Acts 28:8 And it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul went in to him, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and restored him to health.
Acts 28:9 Therefore, after this had been clone, the rest also in the island who had diseases, came and were cured.
Acts 28:10 And they also honored us with many honors; and, when we put to sea, they supplied us with such things as we needed. <div eID="gen1012" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1013" type="x-p"/>

Acts 28:14 where we found brethren, and were persuaded to remain with them seven days. And thus we went toward Home.
Acts 28:15 And from this place, the brethren, having heard of us, came out as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns, to meet us. When Paul saw the brethren, he thanked God, and took courage. <div eID="gen1013" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1014" type="x-p"/>

Acts 28:18 They, after examination, would have released me, for they found no cause of death in me.
Acts 28:19 But because the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Cæsar: not that I have any accusation to bring against my own nation.

Romans 1:2 which he formerly promised through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
Romans 1:3 concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the posterity of David according to the flesh,

Romans 1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that, without ceasing, I make mention of you,
Romans 1:10 always in my prayers making request, that, if possible, I may at length have a prosperous journey, by the will of God to come to you.

Romans 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who, by unrighteousness, restrain the truth.
Romans 1:19 Because that which may be known of God, is manifest among them; for God has made it manifest to them,
Romans 1:20 (for, since the creation of the world, his attributes, which are invisible, are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity,) that they may be without excuse;
Romans 1:21 because, when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were they thankful; but they became perverse in their reasonings, and their wicked heart was darkened;
Romans 1:22 professing to be wise, they became foolish,
Romans 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. <div eID="gen1027" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1028" type="x-p"/>

Romans 1:25 who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
Romans 1:26 For this reason, God delivered them over to vile passions: for their females exchanged their natural use for that which is against nature:
Romans 1:27 and in like manner also the males, leaving the natural use of the females, burned in their lusts one toward another, males with males practicing infamous lewdness, and receiving in themselves the due reward of their error. <div eID="gen1028" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1029" type="x-p"/>

Romans 1:30 whisperers, evil-speakers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents;
Romans 1:31 without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful;

Romans 2:1 For which reason, you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are, that judge; for in that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge, practice the same things.
Romans 2:2 But we know that the judgment of God against those who practice such things, is according to truth.
Romans 2:3 But do you, O man, who judge those that practice such things, and yet do the same, conclude that you will escape the judgment of God?
Romans 2:4 Or, do you despise the riches of his goodness, and his forbearance, and his long suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? <div eID="gen1030" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1031" type="x-p"/>

Romans 2:8 but to those who are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, anger and wrath,
Romans 2:9 affliction and distress, upon every soul of man that practices what is evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek:
Romans 2:10 but glory and honor and peace to every one that practices what is good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:

Romans 2:13 in the day when God shall judge the secret works of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
Romans 2:14 For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
Romans 2:15 For when the Gentiles, who have not a law, do, by nature, the things of the law, these who have not a law, are a law to themselves,
Romans 2:16 who show that the work which the law requires, is written in their hearts, their conscience bearing testimony, and their reasonings with each other accusing, or making excuse. <div eID="gen1032" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1033" type="x-p"/>
Romans 2:17 But if you are named Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast in God.
Romans 2:18 and know his will, and approve what is excellent, being instructed by the law:
Romans 2:19 if you are also confident that you yourself are a guide for the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
Romans 2:20 an instructor of the simple, a teacher of the unlearned, because you have the form of true knowledge in the law;
Romans 2:21 you, then, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal?
Romans 2:22 You who say that a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?
Romans 2:23 You who make your boast in the law, do you, by transgressing the law, dishonor God?

Romans 2:25 Now, circumcision is indeed profitable, if you keep the law: but, if you transgress the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
Romans 2:26 If, then, he who is uncircumcised keeps the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
Romans 2:27 And shall not he whose want of circumcision is owing to his birth, if he keeps the law, condemn you, who, by the literal circumcision, transgress the law?
Romans 2:28 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:
Romans 2:29 but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.  <chapter eID="Rom.2"/> <div eID="gen1034" type="x-p"/>

Romans 3:1 What advantage then has the Jew, or what profit has circumcision?
Romans 3:2 Much in every respect; but chiefly that the oracles of God were intrusted to them.
Romans 3:3 What, indeed, if some have been unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness overthrow the faithfulness of God?
Romans 3:4 It can not be. But let God be true, though every man be a liar, as it is written: That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. <div eID="gen1035" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1036" type="x-p"/>
Romans 3:5 But if our unrighteousness causes the righteousness of God to be better known, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous, who inflicts punishment? I speak as a man.
Romans 3:6 It can not be: for if so, how shall God judge the world? <div eID="gen1036" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1037" type="x-p"/>

Romans 3:9 What then? Do we, Jews, excel? Not at all: for we have already convicted all, both Jews and Greeks, of being under sin,
Romans 3:10 as it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one;
Romans 3:11 there is none that understands; there is none that seeks after God;
Romans 3:12 they have all turned out of the way; they have alike become unprofitable; there is none that does good, not even one;
Romans 3:13 their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;
Romans 3:14 their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;
Romans 3:15 their feet are swift to shed blood;
Romans 3:16 destruction and misery are in their ways;
Romans 3:17 and the way of peace they have not known;
Romans 3:18 there is no fear of God before their eyes. <div eID="gen1039" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1040" type="x-p"/>
Romans 3:19 Now we know that what the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God.
Romans 3:20 Wherefore, by works of law, no flesh shall be justified in his sight; for by law is the knowledge of sin. <div eID="gen1040" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1041" type="x-p"/>
Romans 3:21 But now, the righteousness of God without law is revealed, being attested by the law and the prophets;
Romans 3:22 I repeat it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, which is for all, and on all that believe; for there is no difference;
Romans 3:23 for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God,
Romans 3:24 yet may be justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
Romans 3:25 whom God has set forth as a propitiatory sacrifice, through faith in his blood, in order to manifest his righteousness, in passing by the sins that were formerly committed through the forbearance of God;
Romans 3:26 in order to manifest his righteousness at the present time, that he might be just, while he justifies him who believes in Jesus. <div eID="gen1041" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1042" type="x-p"/>
Romans 3:27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No; but by the law of faith.
Romans 3:28 For we conclude that a man is justified by faith, without deeds of law.
Romans 3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
Romans 3:30 since there is one God, who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith.
Romans 3:31 Do we, then, make law void through the faith? It can not be. On the other hand, we establish law.  <chapter eID="Rom.3"/> <div eID="gen1042" type="x-p"/>

Romans 4:1 What, then, shall we say that Abraham our father has found, as it respects the flesh?
Romans 4:2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has cause for boasting, but not before God.
Romans 4:3 For what says the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
Romans 4:4 Now to him that works, the reward is not counted as a favor, but as a debt:
Romans 4:5 but to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. <div eID="gen1043" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1044" type="x-p"/>
Romans 4:6 Even as David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God counts righteousness without works, saying:
Romans 4:7 Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Romans 4:8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not charge sin. <div eID="gen1044" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1045" type="x-p"/>
Romans 4:9 Comes this blessedness then on those who are circumcised only, or on those who are uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness. <div eID="gen1045" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1046" type="x-p"/>
Romans 4:10 Under what circumstances, then, was it counted? After he was circumcised? Or, while he was uncircumcised? Not after he was circumcised, but while he was uncircumcised.
Romans 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while he was uncircumcised, in order that he might be the father of all that believe, even in a state of uncircumcision, so that righteousness might be counted to them also;
Romans 4:12 and the father of circumcision to those who are not only circumcised, but who, also, walk in the steps of that faith which our father Abraham had while he was yet uncircumcised. <div eID="gen1046" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1047" type="x-p"/>
Romans 4:13 For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, nor to his posterity, through law, but through the righteousness of faith.
Romans 4:14 For if they that are of the law be heirs, the faith is made powerless, and the promise is unmeaning;
Romans 4:15 for the law inflicts punishment; for where no law is, there is no transgression.
Romans 4:16 Therefore, the inheritance is by faith, that it may be according to grace, in order that the promise may be sure to all his posterity, not to those only who are of the law, but to those, also, who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
Romans 4:17 (as it is written: I have made you a father of many nations,) in the sight of him in whom he believed, even God, who makes the dead alive, and calls those things which are not, as though they were. <div eID="gen1047" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1048" type="x-p"/>
Romans 4:18 He, against hope, confidently believed that he would become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken: So shall your posterity be.
Romans 4:19 And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body, which was already dead, (for he was about a hundred years old,) nor the deadness of Sarah’s womb;
Romans 4:20 and he doubted not, through unbelief, with respect to the promise of God, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,
Romans 4:21 and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform.
Romans 4:22 For this reason, it was counted to him for righteousness. <div eID="gen1048" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1049" type="x-p"/>
Romans 4:23 But that it was counted to him, was not written for his sake alone,
Romans 4:24 but for our sakes also, to whom it shall be counted, if we believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
Romans 4:25 who was delivered up for our offenses, and raised again for our justification.  <chapter eID="Rom.4"/> <div eID="gen1049" type="x-p"/>

Romans 5:1 Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Romans 5:2 through whom we have had access, by faith, into this grace in which we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <div eID="gen1050" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1051" type="x-p"/>
Romans 5:3 And not only so, but we rejoice in afflictions also; because we know that affliction produces patience,
Romans 5:4 and patience, an approved character, and an approved character, hope;
Romans 5:5 and this hope disappoints us not; because the love of God is poured abundantly into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that is given to us.
Romans 5:6 For when we were yet without strength, at the appointed time, Christ died for the ungodly.
Romans 5:7 For hardly, indeed, will one die for a just man; yet, perhaps, for the good man some one would even dare to die.
Romans 5:8 But God makes known his love to us in this, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us:
Romans 5:9 much more, then, since we are now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath through him.
Romans 5:10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. <div eID="gen1051" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1052" type="x-p"/>
Romans 5:11 And not only so, but we rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation. <div eID="gen1052" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1053" type="x-p"/>
Romans 5:12 For this reason, as by one man sin entered into the world, and by his sin, death; and so death passed through to all men, because all have sinned:
Romans 5:13 for till the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged where there is no law.
Romans 5:14 Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is the type of him that was to come.
Romans 5:15 But the favor bestowed is not, in all respects, like the offense: for if, by the offense of one, the many have died, much more have the grace of God and the gift which is by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ, been made abundant for the many.
Romans 5:16 And the gift is not like the sentence that came through one who sinned: for the sentence to condemnation was because of one offense; but the favor bestowed in order to justification, is because of many offenses.
Romans 5:17 For if, by one man’s offense, death has reigned through that one, much more shall those who receive the abundance of the grace, and of the gift of righteousness, reign in life through the one, who is Jesus Christ.
Romans 5:18 Therefore, as, by one offense, sentence came on all men to condemnation, so, also, by one act of righteousness, the gift has come on all men to justification of life.
Romans 5:19 For as by the disobedience of the one man the many have been made sinners, so, also, by the obedience of the one, the many shall be made righteous. <div eID="gen1053" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1054" type="x-p"/>
Romans 5:20 But, besides the first offense, law was introduced, in order that offenses might abound: but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
Romans 5:21 that as sin has reigned, ending in death, so might grace reign by justification, ending in life eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <chapter eID="Rom.5"/> <div eID="gen1054" type="x-p"/> <div eID="gen1026" type="section"/>

Romans 6:1 What, then, shall we say? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
Romans 6:2 It can not be. How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?
Romans 6:3 Know you not that as many of us as were immersed into Christ Jesus, were immersed into his death?
Romans 6:4 Therefore, we are buried with him, by immersion, into death, that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in a new life.
Romans 6:5 For if we have become united to him by the likeness of his death, we shall certainly be united to him by the likeness of his resurrection;
Romans 6:6 knowing this, that our former man has been crucified with him, in order that the sinful body may be deprived of its power, so that we should no longer serve sin:
Romans 6:7 for he that is dead is freed from sin. <div eID="gen1056" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1057" type="x-p"/>
Romans 6:8 Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;
Romans 6:9 because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death has dominion over him no longer;
Romans 6:10 for, as it regards his dying, he, once for all, died to sin; but as it regards his living, he lives to God.
Romans 6:11 So also do you count yourselves as dead indeed to sin, but as living to God, in Christ Jesus our Lord. <div eID="gen1057" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1058" type="x-p"/>
Romans 6:12 Therefore, let not sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey it;
Romans 6:13 and present not your members to sin, as instruments of unrighteousness: but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead; and your members to God, as instruments of righteousness.
Romans 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under law, but under grace. <div eID="gen1058" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1059" type="x-p"/>
Romans 6:15 What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? It can not be.
Romans 6:16 Know you not, that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether of sin that leads to death, or of obedience that leads to righteousness?
Romans 6:17 But thanks be to God, that though you were the servants of sin, yet you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching, in which you have been instructed;
Romans 6:18 and being made free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness.
Romans 6:19 I speak of what is common among men, oil account of the weakness of your flesh: for as you have presented your members as servants to uncleanness, and to lawlessness, in order to lawlessness, so now present your members as servants to righteousness, in order to holiness.
Romans 6:20 For when you were the servants of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness.
Romans 6:21 What fruit, therefore, had you at that time, in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
Romans 6:22 But now, since you have been made free from sin, and have become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, eternal life.

Romans 7:1 Know you not, brethren, for I speak to you that are acquainted with law, that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?
Romans 7:2 For the woman that has a husband, is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives: but if her husband die, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
Romans 7:3 So then, if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress.

Romans 7:4 So then, my brethren, you, also, have died to the law, by the body of the Christ, in order that you may be married to another, to him who was raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit to God.
Romans 7:5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were excited by the law, were active in our members, so as to bring forth fruit to death:
Romans 7:6 but now we are made free from the law, being dead to that by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. <div eID="gen1061" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1062" type="x-p"/>
Romans 7:7 What, then, shall we say? Is the law sin? It can not be. Indeed, I had not known sin, except through law. For I had not known evil desire, unless the law had said: You shall not have any evil desire.
Romans 7:8 But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, rendered active within me every evil desire. For without the law, sin was dead.
Romans 7:9 Indeed, I was alive without the law, once; but when the commandment came, sin became alive, and I died:
Romans 7:10 and the commandment, which was given for life, I found to be for death.
Romans 7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
Romans 7:12 Therefore, the law is holy, and the commandment, holy and just and good. <div eID="gen1062" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1063" type="x-p"/>
Romans 7:13 Has, then, that which is good become death to me? It can not be. But sin, that it, might appear sin, was causing death to me through that which is good, in order that sin, through the commandment, might become exceedingly sinful.
Romans 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold into bondage to sin.
Romans 7:15 For what I do, I know not: for that which I wish to do, this I do not; but that which I hate, this I do.
Romans 7:16 If, then, I do that which I wish not to do, I give assent to the law, that it is good.
Romans 7:17 Now, then, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
Romans 7:18 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good; for to will is present with me; but to perform that which is good, I find not.
Romans 7:19 For the good that I wish to do, I do not; but the evil that I wish not to do, this I do.
Romans 7:20 Now, if I do that which I wish not to do, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me. <div eID="gen1063" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1064" type="x-p"/>
Romans 7:21 I find, then, this law: That, when I wish to do good, evil is present with me.
Romans 7:22 For, in the inward man, I delight in the law of God:
Romans 7:23 but I perceive another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind, and making me a captive to the law of sin, which is in my members. <div eID="gen1064" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1065" type="x-p"/>
Romans 7:24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body that subjects me to death?
Romans 7:25 I thank God that I shall be delivered through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind, serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.  <chapter eID="Rom.7"/> <div eID="gen1065" type="x-p"/>

Romans 8:1 There is now, therefore, no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
Romans 8:2 For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin, and of death.
Romans 8:3 For what the law could not do, because it was weak through the flesh, God has done, who, sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for a sin-offering, condemned sin in the flesh,
Romans 8:4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. <div eID="gen1066" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1067" type="x-p"/>
Romans 8:5 For those who are according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
Romans 8:6 For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.
Romans 8:7 Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can it be.
Romans 8:8 Those, then, who are in the flesh, can not please God. <div eID="gen1067" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1068" type="x-p"/>
Romans 8:9 But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now, if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
Romans 8:10 But if Christ is in you, the body is dead, on account of sin, but the Spirit is life, on account of righteousness.
Romans 8:11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised the Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwells in you. <div eID="gen1068" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1069" type="x-p"/>
Romans 8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;
Romans 8:13 for if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.
Romans 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
Romans 8:15 For you have not again received the spirit of bondage, that you may fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.
Romans 8:16 The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are the children of God;
Romans 8:17 and, if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together. <div eID="gen1069" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1070" type="x-p"/>
Romans 8:18 For I consider the sufferings of the present time not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed for us.
Romans 8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the revelation of the sons of God.
Romans 8:20 For the creature was subject to frailty, (not by its own will, but for his sake who subjected it,)
Romans 8:21 in hope, that even the creature itself shall be made free from the bondage of corruption, and introduced into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
Romans 8:22 For we know that every creature groans, and is in pain together, till now:
Romans 8:23 and not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.
Romans 8:24 For we are saved by this hope; but hope that is seen is not hope; for, what any one sees, why does he also hope for it?
Romans 8:25 But if we hope for that which we see not we wait for it with patience. <div eID="gen1070" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1071" type="x-p"/>
Romans 8:26 In like manner, also, the Spirit helps our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us, with groanings unutterable.
Romans 8:27 And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, that he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. <div eID="gen1071" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1072" type="x-p"/>
Romans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good, to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
Romans 8:29 For those whom he foreknew, he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren:
Romans 8:30 and those whom he predestinated he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. <div eID="gen1072" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1073" type="x-p"/>
Romans 8:31 What, then, shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
Romans 8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not with him also freely give us all things?
Romans 8:33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifies.
Romans 8:34 Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died: rather, indeed, that has risen, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
Romans 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?
Romans 8:36 As it is written: For thy sake, we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Romans 8:37 Yet, in all these things, we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.
Romans 8:38 For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
Romans 8:39 nor hight, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  <chapter eID="Rom.8"/> <div eID="gen1073" type="x-p"/> <div eID="gen1055" type="section"/>

Romans 9:1 I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me testimony in the Holy Spirit,
Romans 9:2 That I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart;
Romans 9:3 for I could wish myself to be accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh;
Romans 9:4 who are Israelites, to whom belong the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises;

Romans 9:6 It is not possible that the word of God has failed; for they are not all Israel who are of Israel.
Romans 9:7 Nor, because they are the posterity of Abraham, are they all children: but in Isaac shall your posterity be called.
Romans 9:8 That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the posterity.
Romans 9:9 For the word of the promise is this: At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
Romans 9:10 Not only so, but when Rebecca had conceived by one, even our father Isaac,
Romans 9:11 (the children, indeed, having not yet been born, and having done neither good nor evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls,)
Romans 9:12 it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger;

Romans 9:14 What, then, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with. God? It can not be.
Romans 9:15 For he says to Moses: I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy; and I will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.
Romans 9:16 Therefore, it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.
Romans 9:17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh: For this very purpose have I raised you up, that I may show in you my power, and that my name may be published in all the earth.
Romans 9:18 Therefore, he has mercy on whom he wills to have mercy: and whom he wills to harden, he hardens. <div eID="gen1077" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1078" type="x-p"/>
Romans 9:19 You will then say to me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?
Romans 9:20 No, but rather, O man, who are you that dispute with God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed, it, Why have you made me thus?
Romans 9:21 Has not the potter power over the clay, to make from the same mass one vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
Romans 9:22 What, then, if God, intending to show his wrath, and to make his power known, yet, in much long-suffering bore with the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction:
Romans 9:23 and, that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he before prepared for glory, showed mercy to us,
Romans 9:24 whom he has called, not only from among the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?
Romans 9:25 As he says also in Hosea: I will call that my people which is not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.
Romans 9:26 And it shall come to pass, that, in the place where it was said to them: You are not my people, there shall they be called the sons of the living God.
Romans 9:27 But Isaiah cries concerning Israel: Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
Romans 9:28 for his word he fulfills, and he decrees in righteousness; for his word that is decreed, will the Lord execute upon the land.
Romans 9:29 And as Isaiah said before: Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a posterity, we should have been like Sodom, and been made like Gomorrah. <div eID="gen1078" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1079" type="x-p"/>
Romans 9:30 What, then, shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not seek after justification, have obtained justification, even the justification which is by faith:
Romans 9:31 but Israel, who sought after a law of justification, has not attained to a law of justification. <div eID="gen1079" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1080" type="x-p"/>
Romans 9:32 And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as if by works of law: for they stumbled against that stone of stumbling,

Romans 10:1 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved.
Romans 10:2 For I testify for them, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
Romans 10:3 For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own plan of justification, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God.
Romans 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for justification, to every one that believes. <div eID="gen1081" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1082" type="x-p"/>
Romans 10:5 For Moses describes the justification which is by the law: That the man who does these things shall live by them.
Romans 10:6 But the justification by faith speaks thus: Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;
Romans 10:7 or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ again from the dead.
Romans 10:8 But what says it? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach;
Romans 10:9 that if you will confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and will believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.
Romans 10:10 For with the heart we believe, in order to justification; and with the mouth we make confession, it order to salvation.
Romans 10:11 For the scripture says: He that believes on him shall not be ashamed.
Romans 10:12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all that call on him:
Romans 10:13 For every one that calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. <div eID="gen1082" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1083" type="x-p"/>
Romans 10:14 How, then, shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
Romans 10:15 And how shall they preach, unless they be sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring joyous news of good things!
Romans 10:16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says: Lord, who has believed our report?
Romans 10:17 So, then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
Romans 10:18 But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily; their voice has gone forth into all the earth: and their words to the ends of the world.
Romans 10:19 But I say: Did not Israel know? First, Moses says: I will excite you to jealousy by that which is no nation; and by a foolish nation I will provoke you to wrath.
Romans 10:20 But Isaiah is very bold, and says: I was found by them that sought me not: I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.

Romans 11:1 I say, then, Has God rejected his people? It can not be. For I am an Israelite, of the posterity of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans 11:2 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture says, in regard to Elijah? how he intercedes with God against Israel, saying:
Romans 11:3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thy altars, and I am left alone, and they seek: my life.
Romans 11:4 But what says the answer of God to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

Romans 11:9 And David says: Let their table become a trap, and a net, and a snare, and a recompense to them;

Romans 11:11 I say, then, Have they stumbled, in order that they may fall? It can not be. But rather, through their fall, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to excite them to jealousy.
Romans 11:12 Now, if their fall be the riches of the world, and their loss be the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their full acceptance <transChange type="added">be the riches of the world</transChange>?
Romans 11:13 For I speak to you, Gentiles; inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I do honor to my ministry,
Romans 11:14 if, by any means, I may excite to jealousy those who are my flesh, and save some of them.
Romans 11:15 For, if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the reception of them be, but life from the dead? <div eID="gen1086" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1087" type="x-p"/>
Romans 11:16 Now, if the first fruit is holy, the mass is holy also: and if the root is holy, the branches are holy also.
Romans 11:17 And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, have been grafted in among them, and partake with them of the root and fatness of the olive,
Romans 11:18 boast not against the branches; but if you boast, boast not that you bear the root, but that the root bears you.
Romans 11:19 You will say then: The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
Romans 11:20 Well; on account of unbelief they were broken off; but you stand by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.
Romans 11:21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed, lest he spare not you. <div eID="gen1087" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1088" type="x-p"/>

Romans 11:23 And they, also, if they continue not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.

Romans 13:11 And do this, because you know the time, that the hour has already come when we should awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed:
Romans 13:12 the night is far advanced, the day draws near. Let us, therefore, put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Romans 13:13 Let us walk in a becoming manner, as in the day; not in riotings and in drunkenness, not in lewdness and in wantonness, not in contention and in envy:
Romans 13:14 but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh.  <chapter eID="Rom.13"/> <div eID="gen1099" type="x-p"/>

Romans 14:1 Him that is weak in the faith, receive kindly, but not to judge his reasonings.
Romans 14:2 One believes that he may eat all things; another, who is weak, eats herbs.
Romans 14:3 Let not him that eats, despise him that eats not; and let not him that eats not, judge him that eats: for God has received him.
Romans 14:4 Who are you that judge another man’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls; indeed, he shall stand, for God is able to make him stand. <div eID="gen1100" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1101" type="x-p"/>
Romans 14:5 One man thinks that one day is better than another; another thinks that every day is alike. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.
Romans 14:6 He that regards the day, to the Lord he regards it; and he that does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats, eats to the Lord; for he gives God thanks: and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.
Romans 14:7 For no one lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.
Romans 14:8 For if we live, we live to the Lord; or if we die, we die to the Lord. Whether, therefore, we live or die, we are the Lord’s.
Romans 14:9 For this very purpose, Christ both died and rose, and lived again, that he might have dominion over the dead and the living. <div eID="gen1101" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1102" type="x-p"/>
Romans 14:10 But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we all shall stand before the judgment-seat of the Christ.
Romans 14:11 For it is written: As I live, says the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess to God.
Romans 14:12 Therefore, every one of us shall give an account of himself to God. <div eID="gen1102" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1103" type="x-p"/>
Romans 14:13 Let us, therefore, no longer judge one another: but rather decide to put no stumbling-block or snare in your brother’s way.
Romans 14:14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself; but if any one thinks that any thing is unclean, to him it is unclean.
Romans 14:15 But if your brother is grieved on account of your food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not, with your food, destroy him, for whom Christ died.
Romans 14:16 Therefore, let not that which is your good be evil spoken of.
Romans 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. <div eID="gen1103" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1104" type="x-p"/>
Romans 14:18 For he who serves the Christ in these things is acceptable to God, and approved by men.
Romans 14:19 Therefore, let us seek those things which belong to peace, and those which tend to mutual edification.
Romans 14:20 Destroy not the work of God on account of food. All meats, indeed, are clean; but meat is an evil to that man who, by eating, causes another to stumble.
Romans 14:21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do any thing by which your brother stumbles, or is ensnared, or is made weak.
Romans 14:22 Have you faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who condemns not himself in that which he approves.
Romans 14:23 But he that doubts is condemned, if he eat, because he eats not with faith. Every thing that is not of faith, is sin.  <chapter eID="Rom.14"/> <div eID="gen1104" type="x-p"/>

Romans 15:1 But we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of those who are not strong, and not to please ourselves.
Romans 15:2 Let each one of us please his neighbor in that which is good for his edification.
Romans 15:3 For the Christ did not please himself; but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell on me.
Romans 15:4 For the things which were formerly written, were written for our instruction, that we, through the patience and the comfort which the scriptures give, might have hope.
Romans 15:5 Now, may the God of patience and comfort make you of the same mind one toward another, according to Christ Jesus;
Romans 15:6 that with one mind and with one voice you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 15:7 Wherefore, receive one another with kindness, as the Christ has received you, to the glory of God. <div eID="gen1105" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1106" type="x-p"/>
Romans 15:8 Now, I say, that Jesus Christ, as a minister, was of the circumcision for the sake of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises made to the fathers,
Romans 15:9 and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: For this cause I will give praise to thee among the Gentiles, and to thy name will I sing.
Romans 15:10 And again he says: Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.
Romans 15:11 And again: Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and applaud him all you peoples.
Romans 15:12 And again, Isaiah says: There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to rule the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.
Romans 15:13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in the hope, by the power of the Holy Spirit. <div eID="gen1106" type="x-p"/> <div eID="gen1091" type="majorSection"/> <div sID="gen1107" type="majorSection"/>  <div sID="gen1108" type="x-p"/>
Romans 15:14 And I myself am persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of all goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another.
Romans 15:15 Yet I have written to you more boldly in part, my brethren, as if I would put you in remembrance, on account of the grace which is given to me by God,
Romans 15:16 that I may be the public servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, officiating as a priest with respect to the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Romans 15:17 I have, therefore, cause to glory in Christ Jesus in things that pertain to God. <div eID="gen1108" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1109" type="x-p"/>
Romans 15:18 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, by word and deed, in order to make the Gentiles obedient,
Romans 15:19 by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit. So that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of the Christ;
Romans 15:20 so earnestly desirous have I been to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, lest I should build on another man’s foundation;
Romans 15:21 but, as it is written: They to whom he was not preached, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand. <div eID="gen1109" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1110" type="x-p"/>
Romans 15:22 For which reason, also, I have been often hindered from coming to you.
Romans 15:23 But now, having no longer a place in these regions, and having had for many years a strong desire to come to you,
Romans 15:24 when I make my journey into Spain, I hope, in passing through, to see you, and to be conducted by you on my journey thither, after I am first partly satisfied with your company.
Romans 15:25 But now I am going to Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.
Romans 15:26 For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor saints who are in Jerusalem:
Romans 15:27 they have been pleased to do so, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have become partakers of their spiritual things, they ought to minister to them in things pertaining to the flesh.
Romans 15:28 When, therefore, I shall have performed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.
Romans 15:29 And I know that in coming to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ. <div eID="gen1110" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1111" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 1:13 Is the Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were you immersed into the name of Paul?

I Corinthians 1:15 that no one may say that I immersed into my own name.
I Corinthians 1:16 I did, indeed, immerse the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I immersed any other.
I Corinthians 1:17 For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of speech, lest the cross of the Christ should be deprived of its power.
I Corinthians 1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to those who perish, foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God.
I Corinthians 1:19 For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; and I will set aside the understanding of the prudent.
I Corinthians 1:20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
I Corinthians 1:21 For, since in the wisdom of God, the world, by its wisdom, knew not God, it has pleased God, through the foolishness of what is preached, to save those who believe.
I Corinthians 1:22 For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek for wisdom;
I Corinthians 1:23 but we preach Christ crucified; to the Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks, foolishness:
I Corinthians 1:24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

I Corinthians 5:1 It is generally reported that there is lewdness among you; and such lewdness as is not even mentioned among the Gentiles―that a certain one has his father’s wife.
I Corinthians 5:2 And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken from among you.
I Corinthians 5:3 For I, indeed, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as if I were present, judged him that has so done this thing;
I Corinthians 5:4 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you and my spirit have come together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
I Corinthians 5:5 that we deliver such a one over to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. <div eID="gen1141" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1142" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 5:11 but now I write to you, not to associate with any one professing to be a brother, if he is lewd or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one not even to eat.
I Corinthians 5:12 For what right have I to judge those who are without? Do you not judge those who are within?

I Corinthians 6:2 Know you not that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you unworthy to decide concerning the smallest matters?
I Corinthians 6:3 Know you not that we shall judge angels? Much more then, things pertaining to this life.

I Corinthians 6:7 Now, certainly, you are altogether in fault, that you have law-suits with one another. Why do you not rather suffer injustice? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
I Corinthians 6:8 But you act unjustly, and you defraud, and that, too, your brethren.
I Corinthians 6:9 Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither lewd persons, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor catamites, nor sodomites,
I Corinthians 6:10 nor thieves, nor defrauders, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

I Corinthians 6:14 and God has raised, up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.

I Corinthians 7:1 Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
I Corinthians 7:2 But, to avoid lewd practices, let every man have his own wife, and every woman her own husband.
I Corinthians 7:3 Let the husband render to the wife that which is due, and likewise, also, the wife to the husband.
I Corinthians 7:4 The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband; likewise, also, the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife.
I Corinthians 7:5 Debar not one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may have leisure for prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you through your incontinence.
I Corinthians 7:6 But this I say by permission, not by commandment:
I Corinthians 7:7 for I could wish that all men were even as I am myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that. <div eID="gen1148" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1149" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It would be good for them, if they remain as I myself.
I Corinthians 7:9 But if they can not be continent, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.
I Corinthians 7:10 But to the married I give commandment, not I, but the Lord: Let not the wife leave her husband:
I Corinthians 7:11 but if she leave him, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and, let not the husband put away his wife. <div eID="gen1149" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1150" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 7:12 But to the rest, I, and not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she is well pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
I Corinthians 7:13 And if any woman has a husband that believes not, and he is well pleased to dwell with her, let her not put him away.
I Corinthians 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; for if not, then are your children unclean; but now they are holy.
I Corinthians 7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart; the brother or sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called us to live in peace.
I Corinthians 7:16 For how do you know, O wife, but that you may save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, but that you may save your wife?
I Corinthians 7:17 But as God has assigned a place to every one, as the Lord has called every one, so let him continue to live: and so do I command in all the churches. <div eID="gen1150" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1151" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 7:18 Has any one been called that had been circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the mark of circumcision. Has any one been called that had not been circumcised? Let him not be circumcised,
I Corinthians 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God is our aim.
I Corinthians 7:20 Let every one remain in that condition in which he was, when called.
I Corinthians 7:21 Were you a servant when you were called? Care not for it. But if you can become free, rather enjoy your freedom.
I Corinthians 7:22 For he that is in the Lord, having been called when a servant, is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise, also, the freeman who has been called, is Christ’s servant.
I Corinthians 7:23 You have been bought with a price; become not the servants of men.
I Corinthians 7:24 Brethren, let every one, in whatever condition he is called, abide in this with God. <div eID="gen1151" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1152" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 7:25 But with respect to virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment as one that is enabled, by the mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.
I Corinthians 7:26 I think, then, that this is good for the present affliction―that it is good for a man to be as he is.
I Corinthians 7:27 Are you bound to a wife? Seek not a separation. Are you loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
I Corinthians 7:28 But if you should marry, you would not sin. And if a virgin should marry, she would not sin. But such will have affliction in the flesh. But I spare you. <div eID="gen1152" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1153" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 7:29 Now, this I say, brethren, the time is fraught with trials. It remains that those who have wives be as though they had them not;
I Corinthians 7:30 and those who weep, as though they wept not; and those who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those who buy, as though they possessed not:
I Corinthians 7:31 and those who use this world, as not abusing it; for the outward show of this world passes away.
I Corinthians 7:32 But I would have you to be without anxiety. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
I Corinthians 7:33 but he that is married, is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
I Corinthians 7:34 There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and in spirit; but she that is married, is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
I Corinthians 7:35 I speak this for your own profit; not that I would entangle you, but that you may decorously and devotedly wait upon the Lord, without distraction. <div eID="gen1153" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1154" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 7:36 But if any man thinks he would treat his virgin daughter amiss, should she pass the bloom of life, and it is necessary that it should be so, let him do as he pleases, he does not sin; let them (<transChange type="added">the suitor and the daughter</transChange>) marry.
I Corinthians 7:37 But he that stands firm in his purpose, having no necessity <transChange type="added">to give his daughter in marriage</transChange>, but has liberty with respect to his own will, and has thus decided in his own heart, that he will keep his daughter a virgin, does well.
I Corinthians 7:38 So then, even he that gives her in marriage, does well; but he that gives her not in marriage, does better. <div eID="gen1154" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1155" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 7:39 The wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband die, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord.
I Corinthians 7:40 But she is happier, in my judgment, if she remains as she is; and I think that I have, also, the Spirit of God.  <chapter eID="1Cor.7"/> <div eID="gen1155" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 8:1 Now, with respect to meats offered to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up with pride, but love edifies.
I Corinthians 8:2 If any one thinks that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet, as he ought to know it:
I Corinthians 8:3 but if any one loves God, he is taught by him).
I Corinthians 8:4 With respect, then, to the eating of meats offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
I Corinthians 8:5 For though there are those which are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are many gods, and many lords,)
I Corinthians 8:6 yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
I Corinthians 8:7 But all have not this knowledge; for some, under the persuasion that an idol is a reality, even yet eat meat, as if it were offered to an idol, and their conscience being weak, is defiled. <div eID="gen1156" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1157" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 8:8 But meat commends us not to God; for, neither if we eat are we better, nor, if we eat not, are we worse.
I Corinthians 8:9 But take heed, lest, by any means, this right of yours become a stumbling-block to those who are weak.
I Corinthians 8:10 For, if any one see you, who have knowledge, reclining at table in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened, so that he will eat meats offered to idols?
I Corinthians 8:11 and will not the weak brother, for whom Christ died, perish through your knowledge?
I Corinthians 8:12 But if you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
I Corinthians 8:13 For which reason, if meat cause my brother to fall, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to fall.  <chapter eID="1Cor.8"/> <div eID="gen1157" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 9:2 If I am not an apostle to others, yet certainly I am to you; for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.
I Corinthians 9:3 My answer to those who examine me is this:
I Corinthians 9:4 Have we not the right to eat and drink?
I Corinthians 9:5 Have we not the right to lead about a sister wife, as the other apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

I Corinthians 9:7 What man ever serves as a soldier, at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit? Or who tends a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?
I Corinthians 9:8 Do I speak these things as a man? Or does not the law, also, say the same?
I Corinthians 9:9 For it is written in the law of Moses: You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain? Has God a care for oxen?
I Corinthians 9:10 or does he say it wholly for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, it was written: that he that plows should plow in hope, and that he that thrashes should thrash in hope of partaking.
I Corinthians 9:11 If we have sown, for your benefit, things that are spiritual, is it a great thing that we reap your carnal things?

I Corinthians 9:15 But I have availed myself of none of these things; nor do I write these things that it should be so done to me. For it would be better for me to die, than that any one should make my boasting vain.
I Corinthians 9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I have no cause for boasting; for a necessity is laid upon me; yes, alas for me, if I preach not the gospel.
I Corinthians 9:17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, an apostolic stewardship has been intrusted to me.
I Corinthians 9:18 What, then, is my reward? That, while I preach, I may make the gospel of Christ to be without charge, in order that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel. <div eID="gen1161" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1162" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 9:19 For, though I am free from all men, yet have I made myself a servant to all, that I may gain the more.

I Corinthians 9:21 to those who are without law, as without law, (not being myself without law to God, but under law to Christ,) that I might gain those who are without law:
I Corinthians 9:22 to the weak I became like one who was weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all things to all men, that I may, by all means, save some.

I Corinthians 11:3 But I wish you to know, that the head of every man is the Christ, and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
I Corinthians 11:4 Every man that prays or prophesies, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
I Corinthians 11:5 But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered, dishonors her head: for it is one and the same as if she was shaved.

I Corinthians 11:22 What, have you not houses in which to eat and drink? or do you despise the church of God, and put those to shame who have nothing to eat? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. <div eID="gen1174" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1175" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 11:23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: That the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was delivered up, took bread;
I Corinthians 11:24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said: Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me.
I Corinthians 11:25 In like manner also, the cup, after he had supped, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.
I Corinthians 11:26 For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord’s death till he come. <div eID="gen1175" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1176" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 11:27 Wherefore he that eats this bread, or drinks this cup of the Lord, in an improper manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
I Corinthians 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup:
I Corinthians 11:29 for he that eats and drinks in an improper manner, eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
I Corinthians 11:30 For this reason, many among you are weak and sick, and many sleep.
I Corinthians 11:31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged;
I Corinthians 11:32 but being judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
I Corinthians 11:33 Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another:
I Corinthians 11:34 and if any one is hungry, let him eat at home, that you come not together for condemnation. But other things I will set in order when I come.  <chapter eID="1Cor.11"/> <div eID="gen1176" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 12:1 But concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.
I Corinthians 12:2 You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to those dumb idols, as you might be led.
I Corinthians 12:3 For this reason, I make known to you, that no one, speaking by the Spirit of God, calls Jesus accursed: and no one can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit. <div eID="gen1177" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1178" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit;
I Corinthians 12:5 and there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;
I Corinthians 12:6 and there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who makes them all effectual in all.
I Corinthians 12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one, for the good of all.
I Corinthians 12:8 For to one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit;
I Corinthians 12:9 to another, faith, by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing, by the same Spirit;
I Corinthians 12:10 to another, the working of mighty deeds; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, different kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues.
I Corinthians 12:11 But all these, the one and the same Spirit makes effectual, distributing to each, respectively, as he wills. <div eID="gen1178" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1179" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 12:12 For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
I Corinthians 12:13 For by one Spirit we all were immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and we all have been made to drink of one Spirit. <div eID="gen1179" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1180" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 12:14 For the body is not one member, but many.
I Corinthians 12:15 If the foot shall say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it, for this reason, no part of the body?
I Corinthians 12:16 And if the ear shall say: Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it, for this reason, no part of the body?
I Corinthians 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
I Corinthians 12:18 But now God has placed the members, each of them, in the body, as it has pleased him.
I Corinthians 12:19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?
I Corinthians 12:20 But now there are many members, but one body.
I Corinthians 12:21 The eye can not say to the hand: I have no need of you; or again, the head to the feet: I have no need of you. <div eID="gen1180" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1181" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 12:22 But much more are those members of the body necessary, which seem to be more feeble.
I Corinthians 12:23 And those members of the body, which, we think, are less honorable, around these we place the more abundant honor; and our uncomely members have the more abundant comeliness:
I Corinthians 12:24 for our comely members have no need. But God has so arranged the body, giving more abundant honor to that part which is deficient,
I Corinthians 12:25 that there may be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same anxious care, one for another;
I Corinthians 12:26 and if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
I Corinthians 12:27 Now, you are the body of Christ, and, as individuals, you are members. <div eID="gen1181" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1182" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 12:28 And God has placed some in the church, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then mighty deeds; then gifts of healing; helps, governments, kinds of tongues.
I Corinthians 12:29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of mighty deeds?
I Corinthians 12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
I Corinthians 12:31 But seek earnestly the best gifts; and yet I show you a more excellent way.  <chapter eID="1Cor.12"/> <div eID="gen1182" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
I Corinthians 13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.

I Corinthians 13:8 Love never fails; but whether there be gifts of prophecy, they shall have an end; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall have an end.
I Corinthians 13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
I Corinthians 13:10 but when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall have an end.
I Corinthians 13:11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I had the mind of a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
I Corinthians 13:12 Now we see through a mirror, obscurely; but then, face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as I am known. <div eID="gen1185" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1186" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 14:1 Cultivate love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.
I Corinthians 14:2 For he that speaks in an unknown tongue, speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands him: but yet in spirit he speaks mysteries.
I Corinthians 14:3 But he that prophesies speaks to men so as to build them up, to exhort and comfort them.
I Corinthians 14:4 He that speaks in an unknown tongue, edifies himself; but he that prophesies, edifies the church.
I Corinthians 14:5 I am willing, indeed, that you should all speak in tongues, but rather that you should prophesy; for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive instruction. <div eID="gen1187" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1188" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 14:6 Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, in what will I profit you, unless I speak to you by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by teaching?
I Corinthians 14:7 And even lifeless instruments, which produce sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the notes, how shall that which is piped or harped be known?
I Corinthians 14:8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
I Corinthians 14:9 So, also, unless you, with the tongue, utter words that are intelligible, how shall that which is spoken be known? for you will speak into the air.
I Corinthians 14:10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without meaning.
I Corinthians 14:11 If, then, I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian; and he that speaks will be a barbarian to me. <div eID="gen1188" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1189" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 14:12 So, also, do you, since you greatly desire spiritual gifts, seek to excel to the building up of the church.
I Corinthians 14:13 For which reason, let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
I Corinthians 14:14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, the spirit which I have prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
I Corinthians 14:15 What, then, is it? I will pray with the spirit which is given to me, and I will pray with my understanding also. I will sing with the spirit that is given to me, and I will sing with my understanding also.
I Corinthians 14:16 Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit that is given to you, how will he that occupies the place of the unlearned man say Amen, when you give thanks, since he understands not what you say?
I Corinthians 14:17 For you give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
I Corinthians 14:18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all.
I Corinthians 14:19 Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. <div eID="gen1189" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1190" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 14:20 Brethren, be not children in understanding: yet, in malice, be childlike; but, in understanding, be full-grown men.
I Corinthians 14:21 In the law it is written: Through men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.
I Corinthians 14:22 Therefore, tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to those who believe not: but prophecy is not for those who believe not, but for those who believe. <div eID="gen1190" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1191" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 14:23 If, then, the whole church come together into the same place, and all speak in tongues, and there come in unlearned men, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?
I Corinthians 14:24 But if all prophesy, and there comes in an unbeliever, or an unlearned man, he is convinced by all, he is examined by all,
I Corinthians 14:25 and the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is really among you. <div eID="gen1191" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1192" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 14:26 What, then, is it, brethren? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has something to teach, has an unknown tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.
I Corinthians 14:27 If any speak in an unknown tongue, let two, or, at most, three, speak at each meeting, and in succession: and let one interpret.
I Corinthians 14:28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church: but let him speak to himself, and to God.
I Corinthians 14:29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge:
I Corinthians 14:30 and if any thing be revealed to one who is sitting by, let the first be silent.
I Corinthians 14:31 For you can all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged;
I Corinthians 14:32 and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
I Corinthians 14:33 for God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints. <div eID="gen1192" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1193" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 14:34 Let your women keep silence in the assemblies; for they ire not permitted to speak; but they must be in subjection, as also says the law.
I Corinthians 14:35 But if they wish to learn any thing,, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for women to speak in an assembly.
I Corinthians 14:36 Has the word of God come forth from you? or did it come to you only? <div eID="gen1193" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1194" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 14:37 If any one has the reputation of being a prophet, or spiritual man, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
I Corinthians 14:38 But if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
I Corinthians 14:39 Wherefore, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
I Corinthians 14:40 Let all things be done with propriety, and in good order.  <chapter eID="1Cor.14"/> <div eID="gen1194" type="x-p"/>

I Corinthians 15:1 But I make known to you, brethren, the gospel that I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
I Corinthians 15:2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. <div eID="gen1195" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1196" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 15:3 For I delivered to you among the first things, that which I also received: That Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures;
I Corinthians 15:4 and that he was buried; and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures;
I Corinthians 15:5 and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve;
I Corinthians 15:6 after that, he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain till this day; but some have fallen asleep.
I Corinthians 15:7 After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.
I Corinthians 15:8 Last of all, he was seen by me also, as one untimely born.
I Corinthians 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, and I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
I Corinthians 15:10 But, by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace, which was bestowed on me, has not been bestowed in vain: but I have labored more abundantly than they all; not I, however, but the grace of God which was with me.
I Corinthians 15:11 Whether, therefore, I or they, so we preached, and so you believed. <div eID="gen1196" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1197" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 15:12 But if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that a resurrection of the dead is impossible?
I Corinthians 15:13 But if a resurrection of the dead is impossible, Christ has not been raised.
I Corinthians 15:14 And if Christ has not been raised, then vain is our preaching, and vain also your faith.
I Corinthians 15:15 We are, indeed, also found false witnesses of God; for we have testified against God, that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead are not raised.
I Corinthians 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised;
I Corinthians 15:17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.
I Corinthians 15:18 Then, also, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
I Corinthians 15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable. <div eID="gen1197" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1198" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 15:20 But now, Christ has risen from the dead, the first-fruits of those who slept.
I Corinthians 15:21 For, since through man came death, through man comes also the resurrection of the dead.
I Corinthians 15:22 For, as in Adam all die, so, also, in Christ shall all be made alive:
I Corinthians 15:23 but each in his own order; Christ the first-fruit, afterward, those who are Christ’s at his coming.
I Corinthians 15:24 Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down every principality and authority and power:
I Corinthians 15:25 for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet.
I Corinthians 15:26 The last enemy, Death, shall be destroyed.
I Corinthians 15:27 For he has put all things under his feet. But when the scripture says, that all things are put under him, it is evident that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.
I Corinthians 15:28 And when all things shall have been put under him, then, also, shall the Son himself be subjected to him that did put all things under him, that God may be the all in all. <div eID="gen1198" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1199" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 15:29 For else, what shall those do, who are immersed for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why, then, are they immersed for the dead?
I Corinthians 15:30 And why are we in danger every hour?
I Corinthians 15:31 I protest, by the joy which I have over you in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
I Corinthians 15:32 If, to speak as a man, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
I Corinthians 15:33 Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt good manners.
I Corinthians 15:34 Awake, as you should, to soberness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. <div eID="gen1199" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1200" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 15:35 But some one will say: How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
I Corinthians 15:36 Thoughtless man! That which you sow is not made alive, unless it die;
I Corinthians 15:37 and as to that which you sow, you sow not the body that shall be produced, but the naked grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other grain:
I Corinthians 15:38 but God gives it a body, as it pleases him; and to every seed, its proper body.
I Corinthians 15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
I Corinthians 15:40 There are also bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and that of the terrestrial is another.
I Corinthians 15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory. <div eID="gen1200" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1201" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 15:42 So, also, is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption:
I Corinthians 15:43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power:
I Corinthians 15:44 it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.
I Corinthians 15:45 So, also, it is written: The first man Adam became a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit.
I Corinthians 15:46 But that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is animal; and afterward that which is spiritual.
I Corinthians 15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man, the Lord from heaven.
I Corinthians 15:48 As the earthy man was, such also are the earthy; and as the heavenly man is, such also shall the heavenly be.
I Corinthians 15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
I Corinthians 15:50 But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption. <div eID="gen1201" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1202" type="x-p"/>
I Corinthians 15:51 Behold, I declare to you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed
I Corinthians 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
I Corinthians 15:53 For this corruptible body must put on incorruptibility; and this mortal body must put on immortality.
I Corinthians 15:54 And when this corruptible body shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.
I Corinthians 15:55 O Death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory?
I Corinthians 15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
I Corinthians 15:57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
I Corinthians 15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.  <chapter eID="1Cor.15"/> <div eID="gen1202" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 1:2 grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <div eID="gen1214" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1215" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort,
II Corinthians 1:4 who con soles us in all our afflictions, so that we are able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
II Corinthians 1:5 For as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us, so also through Christ abounds our consolation.
II Corinthians 1:6 And if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which salvation is effected by your patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer; (and our hope in you is steadfast;) or if we are consoled, it is for your comfort and salvation;
II Corinthians 1:7 because we know, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you shall be partakers of the comfort. <div eID="gen1215" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1216" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 1:8 For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which came upon us in Asia, that we were exceedingly oppressed, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.
II Corinthians 1:9 But we have in ourselves the sentence of death, that we may not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead;
II Corinthians 1:10 who delivered us from so great a death, and does still deliver us: in whom we have confidence, that he will continue to deliver us,
II Corinthians 1:11 if you also unite in prayer for our aid, that the favor bestowed on us, through the intercession of many persons, may cause thanks to be given by many for us. <div eID="gen1216" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1217" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 1:12 For the ground of our rejoicing is this: the testimony of our conscience that we have lived in the world more―abundantly, indeed, for you―in sincerity and godly purity, not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God.
II Corinthians 1:13 For we write to you nothing else than what you recognize, or even acknowledge; and which I hope you will acknowledge to the end;
II Corinthians 1:14 as some of you also acknowledge us, that we are the cause of your rejoicing, even as you, also, are of ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. <div eID="gen1217" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1218" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 1:15 And in this confidence I intended to go to you before, that you might have a second benefit;
II Corinthians 1:16 and by you, to pass through into Macedonia, and to come again to you from Macedonia, and be conducted by you into Judea.
II Corinthians 1:17 In forming this purpose, did I, therefore, behave with levity? or do I purpose what I purpose, according to the flesh, that there may be with me, yes yes, and no, no? <div eID="gen1218" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1219" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 1:18 But God is true; for our preaching to you was not yes and no:
II Corinthians 1:19 for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.
II Corinthians 1:20 For whatever promises of God there are, are in him yes, and in him amen, to the glory of God by us.
II Corinthians 1:21 For he who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God,
II Corinthians 1:22 who has also set his seal upon us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. <div eID="gen1219" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1220" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 1:23 But I call on God as a witness against my soul, that wishing to spare you, I did not go to Corinth;
II Corinthians 1:24 not that we are lords over your faith, but fellow-workers for your joy: for by faith you stand.  <chapter eID="2Cor.1"/> <div eID="gen1220" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 2:1 But I determined this in myself, that with sorrow I would not again come to you:
II Corinthians 2:2 for if I cause you to grieve, who is he that makes me glad, but he that is made sorry by me?
II Corinthians 2:3 And I wrote to you this very thing, that, on coming to you, I might not have sorrow from those from whom I ought to receive joy; because I have confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
II Corinthians 2:4 For out of much affliction and distress of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you might be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly for you. <div eID="gen1221" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1222" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 2:5 But if any one has caused grief, he has grieved, not me only, but, in some measure―not to speak harshly―all of you.
II Corinthians 2:6 Sufficient for such a one is the punishment, which was inflicted by the greater number:
II Corinthians 2:7 so that, on the other hand, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such a one should be swallowed up in too much sorrow.
II Corinthians 2:8 Wherefore, I exhort you to give him an assurance of your love.
II Corinthians 2:9 For I wrote to you for this purpose also, that I might have a sure proof from you, whether you are obedient in all things.
II Corinthians 2:10 Whom you forgive any thing, I forgive it also: for what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven any thing, I have forgiven for your sake, in the person of Christ,
II Corinthians 2:11 lest an advantage should be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices. <div eID="gen1222" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1223" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 2:12 And when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of the Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
II Corinthians 2:13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but I took leave of them, and went into Macedonia. <div eID="gen1223" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1224" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 2:14 Now, thanks be to God, who always causes us to triumph in the Christ, and sheds in every place, by us, the fragrance of the knowledge of himself.
II Corinthians 2:15 For, through God, we are a sweet odor of Christ, among the saved, and among the lost:
II Corinthians 2:16 to the one, we are the odor of death ending in death; to the other, the odor of life ending in life: and who is sufficient for these things?
II Corinthians 2:17 For we do not, as the many, adulterate the word of God; but, as from sincerity, but, as from God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.  <chapter eID="2Cor.2"/> <div eID="gen1224" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 3:1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
II Corinthians 3:2 You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
II Corinthians 3:3 you are well known to be a letter of Christ, written by us as his ministers, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. <div eID="gen1225" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1226" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 3:4 Now, confidence such as this we have, through the Christ, toward God;
II Corinthians 3:5 not that we are able, of ourselves, to devise anything, as from ourselves; but our ability is from God,
II Corinthians 3:6 who has made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit makes alive.
II Corinthians 3:7 For if the ministering of death, <transChange type="added">by means of a covenant</transChange> that was written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the sons of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, which glory was to come to an end:
II Corinthians 3:8 how shall not the ministering of the spirit be more glorious?
II Corinthians 3:9 For if the ministering of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministering of righteousness surpass in glory.
II Corinthians 3:10 For that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that surpasses.
II Corinthians 3:11 For if that which was to come to an end was glorious, much more that which is to remain is glorious. <div eID="gen1226" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1227" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 3:12 Since then we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech,
II Corinthians 3:13 and do not as Moses did, who put a vail over his face, so that the sons of Israel could not steadily look to the end of that which was to come to an end.
II Corinthians 3:14 But their minds were blinded: for till this day, in the reading of the old covenant, the same vail remains not taken away, which vail is removed in Christ.
II Corinthians 3:15 But to this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart:
II Corinthians 3:16 but whenever their heart shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
II Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
II Corinthians 3:18 And we all, with unvailed face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit.  <chapter eID="2Cor.3"/> <div eID="gen1227" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 4:1 Wherefore, having this ministry, inasmuch as we have received mercy, we faint not;
II Corinthians 4:2 but we have renounced the secret works of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but, by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. <div eID="gen1228" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1229" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 4:3 But if our gospel is vailed, it is vailed among the lost,
II Corinthians 4:4 whose unbelieving minds the god of this age has darkened, so that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine to them.
II Corinthians 4:5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants, for Jesus sake.
II Corinthians 4:6 Because God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the person of Jesus Christ. <div eID="gen1229" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1230" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be God’s and not our own.
II Corinthians 4:8 We are pressed on all sides, yet not restrained; perplexed, but not in despair;
II Corinthians 4:9 persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
II Corinthians 4:10 always bearing about in our body the violent death of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body.
II Corinthians 4:11 For we who live are continually delivered up to death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh. <div eID="gen1230" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1231" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 4:12 So, then, death is active in us, but life in you.
II Corinthians 4:13 But, having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and for this reason I have spoken; we also believe, and for this reason we speak,
II Corinthians 4:14 knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also by Jesus, and present us together with you.
II Corinthians 4:15 For all these afflictions are for your sakes, that the favor which abounds <transChange type="added">to me</transChange>, may, through the thanksgiving of the many, abound richly to the glory of God. <div eID="gen1231" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1232" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 4:16 For this reason we faint not: but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
II Corinthians 4:17 For our present light affliction works out for us an eternal fullness of glory, excelling all excellence,
II Corinthians 4:18 while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen: for the things seen are temporal; but the things not seen are eternal.  <chapter eID="2Cor.4"/> <div eID="gen1232" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house, which is but a tent, should be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
II Corinthians 5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house that is from heaven,
II Corinthians 5:3 since, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked.
II Corinthians 5:4 For we who are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not because we wish to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. <div eID="gen1233" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1234" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 5:5 Now, he that has formed us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the earnest of the Spirit.
II Corinthians 5:6 Therefore, we are always confident, especially since we know that, while living in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
II Corinthians 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight:
II Corinthians 5:8 we are confident, indeed, and would be pleased rather to depart from the body, and to dwell with the Lord.
II Corinthians 5:9 For this reason we also endeavor, whether we remain in the body or depart from it, to be acceptable to him.
II Corinthians 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each may receive his reward for the things done in his body, according to what he has done, whether good or evil. <div eID="gen1234" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1235" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 5:11 Knowing, then, the fearful judgment of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God. I hope, indeed, that we are also made manifest in your consciences.
II Corinthians 5:12 We do not again commend ourselves to you, but give you an occasion to boast of us, that you may be able to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
II Corinthians 5:13 For if we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or, if we be of sound mind, it is for you.
II Corinthians 5:14 For the love of Christ constrains us, because we have this judgment―that if one died for all, then have all died:
II Corinthians 5:15 and he died for all, that those who live should no more live for themselves, but for him who died for them, and rose again. <div eID="gen1235" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1236" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 5:16 So, then, we henceforth know no man according to the flesh; if, indeed, we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we no longer thus know him.
II Corinthians 5:17 So, then, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.
II Corinthians 5:18 And all these things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
II Corinthians 5:19 that is, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not charging their offenses to them, and he has committed to us the word of reconciliation. <div eID="gen1236" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1237" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 5:20 Therefore, we act as ambassadors for Christ, as though God entreated through us; we beseech in Christ’s stead, be reconciled to God:
II Corinthians 5:21 for he has made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.  <chapter eID="2Cor.5"/> <div eID="gen1237" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 6:2 (for he says: I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in the day of salvation I have helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation:)
II Corinthians 6:3 for we put no stumbling-block in any man’s way, in order that this ministry may not be blamed;
II Corinthians 6:4 but in all things we commend ourselves as the ministers of God, in much suffering, in afflictions, in distresses, in straits,
II Corinthians 6:5 in stripes, in prisons,, in commotions, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
II Corinthians 6:6 by purity, by knowledge, by long forbearance, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned,
II Corinthians 6:7 by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
II Corinthians 6:8 by honor and dishonor, by evil report, and good report; as impostors, yet truthful;
II Corinthians 6:9 as unknown, yet well-known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and yet not put to death;

II Corinthians 6:13 That you may repay me in like manner, (I speak as to children,) be you also enlarged. <div eID="gen1239" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1240" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 6:14 Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? What communion has light with darkness?
II Corinthians 6:15 What agreement has Christ with Belial? What connection has a believer with an unbeliever?
II Corinthians 6:16 What has a temple of God in common with one of idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
II Corinthians 6:17 For this reason, come out from among them, and separate yourselves, says the Lord, and touch not an unclean person, and I will receive you;
II Corinthians 6:18 and I will be to you a father, and you shall be to me sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.  <chapter eID="2Cor.6"/> <div eID="gen1240" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 7:1 Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every pollution of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
II Corinthians 7:2 Regard us cordially; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have made gain by no one.
II Corinthians 7:3 I do not say this to condemn you; for I have said before, that you are in our hearts, so that we could die with you, and live with you.
II Corinthians 7:4 Great is my plainness of speech to you, great is my boasting of you; I am filled with comfort, I am exceedingly joyful in all our affliction. <div eID="gen1241" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1242" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 7:5 For when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest; but we were oppressed on every side: without were battles, within were fears.
II Corinthians 7:6 But God, who comforts those who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
II Corinthians 7:7 and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you when he told us of your strong affection, your grief, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.
II Corinthians 7:8 For although I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that the same letter gave you sorrow, though but for a short time.
II Corinthians 7:9 Now I rejoice not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed in order to repentance. For you sorrowed in a way acceptable to God, that you might in nothing receive injury from us.
II Corinthians 7:10 For godly sorrow works repentance not to be regretted, which leads to salvation: but the sorrow of the world works death.
II Corinthians 7:11 For behold this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner; what earnestness it produced in you; what defense of yourselves; what indignation; what fear; what strong affection; what zeal; what assertion of right. In all respects you have shown yourselves to be blameless in this matter.
II Corinthians 7:12 Therefore, though I wrote to you, it was not on account of him who did the wrong, nor on account of him who received the wrong; but that our diligent care for you, in the sight of God, might be made manifest to you. <div eID="gen1242" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1243" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 7:13 For this reason, we have been comforted by means of your comfort: and we rejoiced exceedingly more indeed, on account of the joy of Titus, for his spirit was refreshed by you all.
II Corinthians 7:14 For if I boasted of you to him, in any respect, I am not made ashamed; but as I have spoken all things to you in truth, so also has our boasting to Titus been found to be truth:
II Corinthians 7:15 and his affection for you is the more abundant, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
II Corinthians 7:16 I rejoice that I have confidence in you in all things.  <chapter eID="2Cor.7"/> <div eID="gen1243" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 8:1 We make known to you, brethren, God’s gracious gift, which has been given in the churches of Macedonia;
II Corinthians 8:2 that under an afflicting trial, their overflowing joy, and their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality;
II Corinthians 8:3 for I testify that according to their power, and beyond their power, they gave voluntarily,
II Corinthians 8:4 beseeching us, with much entreaty, that they might give, and take part in the ministering to the saints;
II Corinthians 8:5 and they did this, not only as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and then to us, through the will of God;
II Corinthians 8:6 so that we exhorted Titus, that, as he had previously begun, so he would bring to an end this gift among you also. <div eID="gen1244" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1245" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 8:7 Now as you excel in every thing, in faith, and in speech, and in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love for us, see that you excel in this gift also.
II Corinthians 8:8 I do not speak this as a commandment, but on account of the zeal of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
II Corinthians 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet, for your sakes, he became poor, that you, through his poverty, might become rich.
II Corinthians 8:10 And I give my judgment in this matter; for this is profitable for you, who began not only to do, but to show a willing mind, a year ago.
II Corinthians 8:11 Now, therefore, perfect also the doing of this; that as there was a readiness of mind to be willing, so also there may be an accomplishment <transChange type="added">of the doing</transChange>, out of that which you have.
II Corinthians 8:12 For if there is a readiness of mind, one is accepted according to what he has, not according to what he has not.
II Corinthians 8:13 For I do not intend that there shall be relief to others, and affliction to you; but that, according to equality, your abundance, at the present time, may supply their wants;
II Corinthians 8:14 and that, <transChange type="added">at a future time</transChange>, their abundance may supply your wants; that there may be equality,
II Corinthians 8:15 as it is written: He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little did not lack. <div eID="gen1245" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1246" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 8:16 But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care for you in the heart of Titus:
II Corinthians 8:17 for he accepted my exhortation, and, being more earnest, he went to you of his own accord.
II Corinthians 8:18 And we have sent with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is in all the churches;
II Corinthians 8:19 and who, moreover, was chosen by the churches as our fellow-traveler with this gift, which is to be distributed by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and as a declaration of your readiness of mind;
II Corinthians 8:20 being careful for this―that no one shall blame us in this abundance, which is ministered by us;
II Corinthians 8:21 for we provide what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
II Corinthians 8:22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent on account of the strong confidence which he has in you.
II Corinthians 8:23 If it is necessary to speak of Titus, he is my partner and fellow-worker for you; if our brethren are spoken of, they are the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.

II Corinthians 9:1 For of the relief which is for the saints, it is needless for me to write to you.
II Corinthians 9:2 For I know your readiness of mind, on account of which I boasted of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago: and your zeal has incited very many.
II Corinthians 9:3 But I have sent the brethren, that our boasting of you in this respect may not be in vain; that you may be ready, as I said:
II Corinthians 9:4 lest, possibly, should the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say you) might be made ashamed by this same confident boasting.
II Corinthians 9:5 Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go before to you, and make ready beforehand your bounty, which has been so much talked of before, that this might be ready as a bounty, and not as a gift extorted from you. <div eID="gen1247" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1248" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 9:6 But remember this, that he who sows sparingly, shall also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully, shall also reap bountifully.
II Corinthians 9:7 Let each one give, as he purposes in his heart; not with grief, nor from necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
II Corinthians 9:8 And God is able to confer every gift upon you abundantly, that you, always having all sufficiency in every thing, may have enough for every good work;
II Corinthians 9:9 as it is written: He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.
II Corinthians 9:10 Now, he that furnishes seed to the sower will both furnish bread for food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
II Corinthians 9:11 that you may be enriched in every thing, for all liberality which produces through us thanksgiving to God;
II Corinthians 9:12 because the administration of this service not only supplies the wants of the saints, but also abounds in many thanksgivings to God;
II Corinthians 9:13 (since through the proof which this service gives, they glorify God for your acknowledged subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution for them, and for all;)
II Corinthians 9:14 and in their prayer for you, since they have strong affection for you on account of the eminent grace of God that is in you.

II Corinthians 10:1 Now I, the same Paul, who, when present among you, am timid, but when absent, am bold toward you, entreat you, by the mildness and gentleness of Christ;
II Corinthians 10:2 I, indeed, beseech you, that I may not, when present, be bold with that confidence with which I think I shall be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
II Corinthians 10:3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,
II Corinthians 10:4 (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty, through God, for the overthrowing of strongholds,)
II Corinthians 10:5 overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought to the obedience of the Christ,
II Corinthians 10:6 and being ready to take vengeance on all disobedience, when your obedience shall have been fully established. <div eID="gen1249" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1250" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 10:7 Do you look on things according to the outward appearance? If any one trusts in himself, that he is Christ’s, let him again reason thus of himself: that as he is Christ’s, so also are we.
II Corinthians 10:8 For though I should boast even, somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I would not be ashamed:
II Corinthians 10:9 that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
II Corinthians 10:10 For his letters, says one, are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his style of speech contemptible.
II Corinthians 10:11 Let such a one conclude thus―that such as we are in word, by letters, while absent, such also will we be in deed, when present. <div eID="gen1250" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1251" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 10:12 For we do not presume to rank or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves: but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, have no understanding.
II Corinthians 10:13 But we will not boast ourselves with respect to regions not measured to us; but according to the measure of the line which God, who measures, has appointed for us to reach even to you.
II Corinthians 10:14 For we do not stretch ourselves too far, as if we did not come to you: for even as far as to you, have we already come in the gospel of the Christ,
II Corinthians 10:15 not boasting ourselves in the labors of others in regions not measured off to us, but having hope that, when your faith is increased, we shall be magnified among you abundantly, according to our line,
II Corinthians 10:16 so as to preach the gospel in regions beyond you, and not to boast in regions made ready under another man’s line.
II Corinthians 10:17 But let him that boasts, boast in the Lord:
II Corinthians 10:18 for he that commends himself is not approved; but he whom the Lord commends.  <chapter eID="2Cor.10"/> <div eID="gen1251" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 11:1 I wish you could bear with me a little in my folly; but yet bear with me:
II Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you a chaste virgin to Christ.
II Corinthians 11:3 But I fear lest, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity which pertains to Christ.
II Corinthians 11:4 For if he that comes should preach another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or, if you receive another Spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you would well bear with him. <div eID="gen1252" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1253" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 11:5 I count myself indeed to be in no respect inferior to the very greatest of the apostles.
II Corinthians 11:6 But if I am unpolished in my style of speech, yet I am not so in knowledge. But we have been fully manifested among you in all things.
II Corinthians 11:7 Have I committed a sin, in making myself lowly, that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel to you without cost?
II Corinthians 11:8 I robbed other churches, taking wages to do you service: and when I was present with you, and wanted, I was not a burden to any one;
II Corinthians 11:9 for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my wants; and in every thing I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will continue to keep myself.
II Corinthians 11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting shall not be silenced, in my case, in the regions of Achaia.
II Corinthians 11:11 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.
II Corinthians 11:12 But what I am doing I will also continue to do, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire an occasion, that in what they boast, they may be found even as we. <div eID="gen1253" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1254" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ;

II Corinthians 11:16 I say again, let no one think that I am without understanding; but if so, even as one without understanding bear with me, that I also may boast a little.
II Corinthians 11:17 What I say, I say not according to the Lord, but as in folly, in this same confidence of boasting.
II Corinthians 11:18 Since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.
II Corinthians 11:19 For it is a pleasure to you to bear with men of no understanding, since you yourselves are wise.
II Corinthians 11:20 For you bear it, if one enslave you, if one devour you, if one take from you, if one exalt himself, if one smite you on the face, <div eID="gen1255" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1256" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 11:21 I speak of <transChange type="added">their reproaches</transChange>, as if we were weak. In whatever matter any one is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I also am bold.
II Corinthians 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they of the posterity of Abraham? So am I.
II Corinthians 11:23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I say it foolishly,) I am above them. In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.
II Corinthians 11:24 From the Jews, five times I received forty stripes, save one;
II Corinthians 11:25 three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I have been shipwrecked; a night and a day I spent in the deep.
II Corinthians 11:26 In journeyings often, in perils from rivers, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the desert, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
II Corinthians 11:27 in weariness and in toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness:
II Corinthians 11:28 besides those things which come upon me from other sources, I have a daily concourse of troubles―my anxiety for all the churches. <div eID="gen1256" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1257" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I am not incensed?
II Corinthians 11:30 If I must boast, I will boast in my infirmities.
II Corinthians 11:31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie.
II Corinthians 11:32 In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, desiring to apprehend me:

II Corinthians 12:1 To boast is not suitable for me; I will come to visions and revelations from the Lord.
II Corinthians 12:2 I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago; that such a one (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God knows;) was caught away to the third heaven.
II Corinthians 12:3 I also know that such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knows,)
II Corinthians 12:4 was caught away to Paradise, and heard words not to be spoken, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. <div eID="gen1258" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1259" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 12:5 Of such a one I will boast; but of myself I will not boast, unless in my infirmities.
II Corinthians 12:6 For though I should choose to boast, I would not be void of understanding: for I will speak the truth. But I forbear, lest any one should think of me more than what he sees me to be, or what he hears of me. <div eID="gen1259" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1260" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 12:7 And, lest I should be too much exalted by the excellence of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I might not be too much exalted.
II Corinthians 12:8 With regard to this, I three times entreated the Lord that it might leave me;
II Corinthians 12:9 and he said to me: My grace is sufficient for you; for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ may abide upon me.
II Corinthians 12:10 For this reason, I take pleasure in infirmities, in outrages, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. <div eID="gen1260" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1261" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 12:11 I have become of no understanding; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you: I am in no respect inferior to the very greatest of the apostles, although I am nothing.
II Corinthians 12:12 Truly, the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
II Corinthians 12:13 For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, unless in this―that I did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong. <div eID="gen1261" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1262" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 12:14 Behold, I am ready the third time to come to you, and I will not burden you: for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.
II Corinthians 12:15 I, indeed, will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
II Corinthians 12:16 Be it so, indeed; I did not burden you; but being crafty, I caught you by deceit.
II Corinthians 12:17 Did I overreach you by any of those whom I sent to you?
II Corinthians 12:18 I exhorted Titus, and with him sent the brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps? <div eID="gen1262" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1263" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 12:19 Do you think again that we offer you a defense of ourselves? We speak all these things before God in Christ, beloved, for your edification.
II Corinthians 12:20 For I fear, lest when I come I shall find you not, such as I wish, and I shall be found by you not such as you wish: lest there shall be contentions, envies, excitements, strife, evil speaking, whisperings, party spirit, disorderly conduct:
II Corinthians 12:21 lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn over many of those who have already sinned, and have not repented of the uncleanness and lewdness and wantonness which they have committed.  <chapter eID="2Cor.12"/> <div eID="gen1263" type="x-p"/>

II Corinthians 13:1 The third time am I coming to you. By the mouth of two or three witnesses, every matter shall be established.
II Corinthians 13:2 I have foretold, and now the second time, as if I was present, though being absent, I foretell to those who have sinned, and to all others, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
II Corinthians 13:3 since you seek a proof of Christ’s speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but who is mighty in you:
II Corinthians 13:4 for though he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
II Corinthians 13:5 Make trial of yourselves, whether you are in the faith; put yourselves to the proof. Do you not know your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you? unless you be without proof. <div eID="gen1264" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1265" type="x-p"/>
II Corinthians 13:6 But I hope that you will know that we are not without proof.
II Corinthians 13:7 Yet I pray to God that you may do no evil; not that we may appear as having proof, but that you may do what is good, though we be as without proof.
II Corinthians 13:8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but <transChange type="added">we can do something</transChange> for the truth.
II Corinthians 13:9 For we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong. And we pray also for this―your perfection.
II Corinthians 13:10 For this reason, I write these things, while absent, that I may not, when present, use severity, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for edification, and not for destruction. <div eID="gen1265" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1266" type="x-p"/>

Galatians 1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,)
Galatians 1:2 and all the brethren that are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
Galatians 1:3 grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians 1:4 who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,

Galatians 1:6 I am astonished that you are so soon turning away from him that called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel:
Galatians 1:7 which is nothing else than that there are some who trouble you, and are determined to pervert the gospel of the Christ.
Galatians 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach to you any other gospel than that which we have preached, let him be accursed.
Galatians 1:9 As we said before, so even now I say again, if any one preaches to you any other gospel than that which you have received, let him be accursed.
Galatians 1:10 For, do I now seek the favor of men, or of God? or do I strive to please men? If, indeed, I would still please men, I should not be the servant of Christ. <div eID="gen1270" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1271" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 1:11 But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which is preached by me, is not according to man:
Galatians 1:12 for neither did I receive it from man, nor was it taught me, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians 1:13 For you have heard of my former mode of life in Judaism, that I greatly persecuted the church of God, and laid it waste;
Galatians 1:14 and I surpassed in Judaism many of my own age and nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the tradition of my fathers. <div eID="gen1271" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1272" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 1:15 But when God, who chose me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased
Galatians 1:16 to reveal his Sou in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I at once declined all conference with flesh and blood:
Galatians 1:17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem, to those who were apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and then returned to Damascus. <div eID="gen1272" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1273" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 1:18 Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem, in order to become personally acquainted with Peter; and I remained with him fifteen days:

Galatians 2:1 Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.
Galatians 2:2 And I went up because of a revelation, and communicated to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who are of reputation, lest, by any means, I should run or had run in vain.
Galatians 2:3 But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
Galatians 2:4 <transChange type="added">I acted thus</transChange> indeed on account of false brethren, stealthily brought in, who stole in to spy out our freedom, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage,
Galatians 2:5 to whom we yielded in submission, not even for an hour, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain with you. <div eID="gen1275" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1276" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 2:6 But from those who were supposed to be something; (what they were is a matter of no importance to me: God does not accept the person of man;) they, indeed, who were supposed to be something, communicated no additional truth to me;
Galatians 2:7 but; on the other hand, seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter was with that of the circumcision,
Galatians 2:8 (for he who gave efficiency to Peter, for the apostleship of the circumcision, gave efficiency to me also, <transChange type="added">as an apostle</transChange> for the Gentiles,)
Galatians 2:9 and knowing the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, but they to the circumcision,
Galatians 2:10 <transChange type="added">requesting</transChange> only that we would remember the poor, which same thing I have been diligent in doing. <div eID="gen1276" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1277" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 2:11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I openly opposed him, because he had incurred blame.
Galatians 2:12 For, before certain persons came from James, he ate with the Gentiles: but, when they had come, he withdrew, and separated himself, because he feared those who were of the circumcision.
Galatians 2:13 And the other Jews, also, acted hypocritically with him, so that even Barnabas was led away by their hypocrisy. <div eID="gen1277" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1278" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 2:14 But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter, before them all: If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not after the manner of the Jews, why do you compel the Gen tiles to observe Jewish customs?
Galatians 2:15 We, who are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners,
Galatians 2:16 knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed on Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of law: because, by works of law no flesh shall be justified.
Galatians 2:17 But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are also found sinners, is Christ, therefore, the minister of sin? It can not be.
Galatians 2:18 For if I build again those things which I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
Galatians 2:19 For, through law, I have died to law, that I might live to God.
Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ, yet I live; no longer I, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
Galatians 2:21 I do not set aside the grace of God: for if righteousness be through law, then Christ has died in vain.  <chapter eID="Gal.2"/> <div eID="gen1278" type="x-p"/>

Galatians 3:1 O thoughtless Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been plainly set forth crucified?
Galatians 3:2 This only I wish to learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians 3:3 Are you so thoughtless? After having begun in Spirit, do you make an end in flesh?
Galatians 3:4 Have you suffered so many things in vain? if, indeed, it be in vain.
Galatians 3:5 He that supplies to you the Spirit, and works mighty deeds among you, does he this by works of law or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians 3:6 even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness. <div eID="gen1279" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1280" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 3:7 Know, therefore, that those who are of faith are the sons of Abraham.
Galatians 3:8 For the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached beforehand the gospel to Abraham, saying: In you shall all the nations be blessed.
Galatians 3:9 So, then, those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. <div eID="gen1280" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1281" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that does not continue in all things written in the book of the law to do them.
Galatians 3:11 But that no one is justified by law in the sight of God, is evident: for the just by faith shall live.
Galatians 3:12 The law, indeed, is not of faith; but he that does these things shall live by them.
Galatians 3:13 Christ has bought us off from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:)
Galatians 3:14 in order that the blessing of Abraham may come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we may receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith. <div eID="gen1281" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1282" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 3:15 Brethren, I speak of things common among men: No one sets a covenant aside, or enjoins any thing additional after it is confirmed, though it be a man’s covenant.
Galatians 3:16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring; he does not say: And to offsprings, <transChange type="added">as if he spoke</transChange> of many; but as of one, And to your offspring, which is Christ.
Galatians 3:17 And this I affirm, that the covenant which had been before confirmed by God with respect to Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, could not annul so as to make the promise of no effect.
Galatians 3:18 For if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise: but God bestowed it on Abraham by promise. <div eID="gen1282" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1283" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 3:19 What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the offspring should come, to whom the promise was made,) having been appointed through the service of angels, in the hand of a mediator.
Galatians 3:20 Now, a mediator for one is impossible; but God is one. <div eID="gen1283" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1284" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 3:21 Is the law, then, against the promises of God? It can not be. For if a law had been given which could have given life, surely righteousness would have been by law.
Galatians 3:22 But the scripture has shut up all under sin, that the promise by faith in Christ Jesus may be given to those who believe.
Galatians 3:23 But before the faith came, we were kept under law, being shut up to the faith which was to be revealed. <div eID="gen1284" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1285" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 3:24 So, then, the law was our pedagogue<index index="Glossary" level1="PEDAGOGUE"/> that <transChange type="added">led us</transChange> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Galatians 3:25 But since the faith has come, we are no longer under a pedagogue<index index="Glossary" level1="PEDAGOGUE"/>:
Galatians 3:26 for you are all the sons of God, by faith in Christ Jesus:
Galatians 3:27 for as many of you as have been immersed into Christ, have put on Christ.
Galatians 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bondman nor freeman, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Galatians 4:1 But I say, that the heir, as long as he is a minor, differs in no respect from a servant, though he is owner of all;
Galatians 4:2 but is under guardians and managers till the time appointed by the father.
Galatians 4:3 So, also, we, when we were minors, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world.
Galatians 4:4 But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
Galatians 4:5 that he might buy off those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption.
Galatians 4:6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

Galatians 4:8 But, then, because you knew not God, you were enslaved to those who, by nature, are not gods:
Galatians 4:9 now, however, after having known God, rather indeed having been known by God, how is it that you are turning back to the weak and beggarly rudiments, to which you desire again to be in bondage, as at first?

Galatians 4:13 You know that through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first:
Galatians 4:14 and my trial, which was in my flesh, you did not despise or loathe; but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
Galatians 4:15 How great, then, was your blessedness! For I testify for you, that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes, and have given them to me.

Galatians 4:19 My little children, for whom I again suffer the pains of gestation, till Christ be formed in you,

Galatians 4:21 Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not understand the law?
Galatians 4:22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; one by a bondmaid, and one by a free woman.
Galatians 4:23 But the one by the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; the other, by the free woman, was by promise.
Galatians 4:24 These things are allegorized: for these women are the two covenants; the one from the Mount Sinai that brings forth for bondage, which is Hagar.
Galatians 4:25 For Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage with her children.
Galatians 4:26 But Jerusalem which is above is free; and she is the mother of us all.
Galatians 4:27 For it is written: Rejoice you barren, that do not bear: break forth and cry aloud, you that travail not: for many more are the children of the deserted, than of her that had the husband of the <transChange type="added">deserted</transChange>.
Galatians 4:28 We, indeed, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.
Galatians 4:29 But as then, he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, so even now.
Galatians 4:30 But what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.
Galatians 4:31 Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free-woman.  <chapter eID="Gal.4"/> <div eID="gen1290" type="x-p"/>

Galatians 5:3 I testify indeed again to every man that is circumcised, that he is bound to do the whole law.
Galatians 5:4 You that are justified by law, have withdrawn from Christ: you have fallen from grace.
Galatians 5:5 For we, through the Spirit which we obtain by faith, wait for the hope of righteousness.

Galatians 5:10 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will cultivate no other disposition: but he that troubles you, who ever he may be, shall bear his condemnation.
Galatians 5:11 But, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then, the offense of the cross has ceased.

Galatians 5:16 I say this: Walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
Galatians 5:17 For the desire of the flesh is against the Spirit, and the desire of the Spirit is against flesh; and these are opposed, the one to the other, so that you can not do what you would.
Galatians 5:18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.
Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are well known, and they are these―lewdness, uncleanness, wantonness,
Galatians 5:20 idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strifes, jealousies, anger, party-spirit, divisions, sects,
Galatians 5:21 envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; with respect to which, I tell you now, as I also told you in times past, that those who practice such things shall riot inherit the kingdom of God. <div eID="gen1295" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1296" type="x-p"/>
Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness,
Galatians 5:23 meekness, self-control. Against such there is no law.
Galatians 5:24 Now those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

Galatians 6:2 Bear with the weaknesses of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
Galatians 6:3 For if any one think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself:
Galatians 6:4 but let each one prove his own work, and then he will have cause to boast with respect to himself only, and not with respect to another:

Galatians 6:13 For not even do those very men, who are circumcised, keep the law: but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
Galatians 6:14 But may I never boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
Galatians 6:15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision is any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

Ephesians 5:31 For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.
Ephesians 5:32 Great is this mystery; but I speak of Christ and of the church.
Ephesians 5:33 But yet, let each one of you so love his wife as himself; and let the wife see that she reverence her husband.  <chapter eID="Eph.5"/> <div eID="gen1326" type="x-p"/>

Ephesians 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

Ephesians 6:5 Servants, be subject to your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to the Christ;
Ephesians 6:6 not with eye-service, as pleasing men, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul;
Ephesians 6:7 with good will doing service as to the Lord, and not as to men;

Ephesians 6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in his mighty power.
Ephesians 6:11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against the wiles of the devil:
Ephesians 6:12 for our conflict is not with flesh and blood, but with the principalities, with the authorities, with the rulers of the darkness of this world, with the wicked spirits in the heavenly regions.
Ephesians 6:13 Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand <transChange type="added">them</transChange> in the evil day, and having overcome them all, to stand firm. <div eID="gen1331" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1332" type="x-p"/>
Ephesians 6:14 Stand, therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and wearing the breastplate of righteousness,
Ephesians 6:15 and having your feet shod with that preparation for defense supplied by the gospel of peace;
Ephesians 6:16 taking up, over all, the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one:
Ephesians 6:17 and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
Ephesians 6:18 praying with all prayer and supplication, at all times, in the Spirit; and to this end being watchful in all perseverance, and supplication for all the saints:
Ephesians 6:19 and for me, that speech may be given me, in opening my mouth with boldness, that I may make known the mystery of the gospel,

Philippians 1:3 I thank my God on every remembrance of you―
Philippians 1:4 always in every supplication of mine for you all, making my supplication with joy―
Philippians 1:5 for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day till now:
Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you, will carry it on till the day of Jesus Christ;
Philippians 1:7 as it is right for me to think this of you all, because <transChange type="added">I say I have</transChange> you in my heart; both in my bonds and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, I say I have you all in my heart as being joint partakers of my grace.
Philippians 1:8 For God is my witness how ardently I love you with the affection of Christ Jesus. <div eID="gen1338" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1339" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 1:9 I also pray for this, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all understanding,
Philippians 1:10 in order that you may distinguish things that differ, to the end that you may be pure and blameless till the day of Christ,
Philippians 1:11 being filled with the fruit of righteousness, which fruit is by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. <div eID="gen1339" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1340" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 1:12 But I wish you to know, brethren, that the things which have befallen me have turned out rather to the advancement of the gospel;
Philippians 1:13 so that my bonds which are for Christ have become known to be such in all the palace, and in all other places;
Philippians 1:14 and most of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence in my bonds, are more bold to speak the word without fear. <div eID="gen1340" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1341" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 1:15 Some, indeed, preach the Christ, because of envy and a contentious disposition, and some because of good-will.
Philippians 1:16 These do it from love, because they know that I am set for the defense of the gospel;
Philippians 1:17 those preach Christ from a contentious disposition, not sincerely, thinking that they will add affliction to my bonds.
Philippians 1:18 What difference does this make? Christ is, nevertheless, preached in every way, whether in pretense or in truth; and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice:
Philippians 1:19 for I know that this will result in my benefit through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Philippians 1:20 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but with all boldness, as at all times, so even now, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. <div eID="gen1341" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1342" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 1:21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
Philippians 1:22 But if this, my life in the flesh, would be profitable for my work <transChange type="added">in the ministry</transChange>, verily, what I should choose I know not.
Philippians 1:23 I am in a strait between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better:
Philippians 1:24 yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
Philippians 1:25 And of this I feel assured, that I shall remain and continue among you all for your advancement and joy in the faith,
Philippians 1:26 that your rejoicing in Christ Jesus may become more abundant through me by my being present among you again. <div eID="gen1342" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1343" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 1:27 Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of the Christ, that, whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel,
Philippians 1:28 and in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
Philippians 1:29 For to you it is given in behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but, also, to suffer for him,
Philippians 1:30 since you have the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.  <chapter eID="Phil.1"/> <div eID="gen1343" type="x-p"/>

Philippians 2:1 If, therefore, there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort arising from love, if any participation of the Spirit, if any affections and mercies,
Philippians 2:2 fulfill my joy, that you be of the same mind, having the same love, of one soul, of one mind;
Philippians 2:3 doing nothing in strife and vain glory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.
Philippians 2:4 Consider not each one his own gifts, but each one also the gifts of others. <div eID="gen1344" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1345" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
Philippians 2:6 who, being in the form of God, did not think it an act of robbery to be equal with God;
Philippians 2:7 but he divested himself by taking the form of a servant, and being made in the likeness of men:
Philippians 2:8 and being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient even to death, the death, indeed, of the cross.
Philippians 2:9 For which reason God has highly exalted him, and, also, bestowed on him a name that is above every name;
Philippians 2:10 that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven, and those who are on earth, and those who are under the earth;
Philippians 2:11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <div eID="gen1345" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1346" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 2:12 So, then, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
Philippians 2:13 for it is God, who, of his good pleasure, works in you both the will and the power to perform.
Philippians 2:14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings,
Philippians 2:15 that you may be without reproach and Harmless, the children of God, without blame, in the midst of a wicked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world,
Philippians 2:16 holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, nor labor in vain. <div eID="gen1346" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1347" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 2:17 But if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.
Philippians 2:18 In like manner do you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
Philippians 2:19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy shortly to you, that I also may be refreshed by knowing your condition;
Philippians 2:20 for I have no one of a kindred spirit who will sincerely care for your condition:
Philippians 2:21 for all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 2:22 But you know his approved character, that as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.
Philippians 2:23 Him, therefore, I hope to send immediately, as soon as I know how it may go with me.
Philippians 2:24 But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly. <div eID="gen1347" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1348" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 2:25 Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and companion in labor and fellow-soldier, but your apostle, who also ministered to my want,
Philippians 2:26 because he longed after you all, and was much distressed, because you had heard that he was sick.
Philippians 2:27 And, indeed, he was sick near to death; but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians 2:28 I sent him, therefore, the sooner, that, by seeing him again, you might rejoice, and that I might be the less sorrowful.
Philippians 2:29 Receive him, therefore, in the Lord with all joy, and regard such as worthy of honor;
Philippians 2:30 because for the work of the Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, that he might supply that which was lacking in your service to me.  <chapter eID="Phil.2"/> <div eID="gen1348" type="x-p"/>

Philippians 3:2 Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision.
Philippians 3:3 For we are the circumcision, who worship God in spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;
Philippians 3:4 though, indeed, I have a ground of confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks he has a ground of confidence in the flesh, I more;
Philippians 3:5 circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as it respects law, a Pharisee;
Philippians 3:6 as it respects zeal, persecuting the church; as it respects righteousness which is by law, blameless.
Philippians 3:7 But the things which were gain to me, these I counted loss for Christ. <div eID="gen1350" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1351" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 3:8 Yes, verily, I also count all things to be loss, for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them to be refuse, that I may gain Christ,
Philippians 3:9 and be found in him, not having my own righteousness which was by law, but the righteousness which is by faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith,
Philippians 3:10 that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, by conforming myself to his death,
Philippians 3:11 if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. <div eID="gen1351" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1352" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 3:12 Not that I have already attained, or have already reached the goal; but I am pressing forward, that I may lay hold on that for which I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.
Philippians 3:13 Brethren, I do not conclude that I have already laid hold:
Philippians 3:14 but one thing I do; forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forward to those which are before, I press toward the goal, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. <div eID="gen1352" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1353" type="x-p"/>
Philippians 3:15 Let us, therefore, as many as are fully enlightened, be of this mind: and if you are of another mind with respect to any thing, God will reveal even this to you.
Philippians 3:16 But as far as we have attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us have the same mind.
Philippians 3:17 Be imitators of me, brethren, and observe those who thus walk as you have us for an example.
Philippians 3:18 For many walk, of whom I often said to you, and now say even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of the Christ,
Philippians 3:19 whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
Philippians 3:20 But our citizenship is in heaven, whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
Philippians 3:21 who will transform our humbled body, and make it like his glorious body, according to that power by which he is able to subdue all things to himself.  <chapter eID="Phil.3"/> <div eID="gen1353" type="x-p"/>

Philippians 4:12 I know what it is to be in want, and what it is to have abundance. Everywhere and in all things, I have been fully instructed in being full and in being hungry, in having abundance and in being in want.

Colossians 1:5 in consequence of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
Colossians 1:6 which is present among you, as it is also in all the world, and is producing fruit, even as it has been doing also among you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth,

Colossians 1:14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins;
Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature;

Colossians 2:13 And you, being dead to your offenses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has made alive together with him, having forgiven you all your offenses;
Colossians 2:14 having blotted out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was opposed to us, he also took it out of the way, driving a nail through it by means of his cross;

I Thessalonians 1:4 because we know, brethren beloved of God, your election.
I Thessalonians 1:5 For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in full assurance, as you know what sort of persons we were among you for your sakes.
I Thessalonians 1:6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit,
I Thessalonians 1:7 so that you were examples to all that believe, in Macedonia and Achaia.
I Thessalonians 1:8 For from you, the word of the Lord sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also your faith in God has gone abroad in every place, so that we have no need to speak any thing.
I Thessalonians 1:9 For they themselves declare concerning us what kind of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God,
I Thessalonians 1:10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, even Jesus, whom he raised from the dead, and who delivers us from the coming wrath.  <chapter eID="1Thess.1"/> <div eID="gen1387" type="x-p"/>

I Thessalonians 2:1 For you yourselves know, brethren, our entrance among you, that it was not in vain.
I Thessalonians 2:2 But having suffered before, and having been outraged, as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the midst of great peril.
I Thessalonians 2:3 For our exhortation arose not from deception, nor from uncleanness, nor was it with guile;
I Thessalonians 2:4 but as God had judged us worthy to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.
I Thessalonians 2:5 For neither nattering words did we at any time use, as you know, nor a pretext for covetousness; God is witness:
I Thessalonians 2:6 nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others; though we could have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ.
I Thessalonians 2:7 But we were gentle among you. As a nurse nourishes her children,
I Thessalonians 2:8 so, having a strong affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but our own lives also, because you had become dear to us.
I Thessalonians 2:9 For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for, laboring night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any one of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.
I Thessalonians 2:10 You are witnesses, and God also, in how holy and just and blameless a manner we conducted ourselves among you that believe,
I Thessalonians 2:11 as indeed you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father his children,
I Thessalonians 2:12 that you should walk in a manner worthy of God, who has called you to his own kingdom and glory. <div eID="gen1388" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1389" type="x-p"/>
I Thessalonians 2:13 For this reason, also, we thank God without ceasing; because, when you received the word of God, as preached by us, you embraced it, not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works in you that believe.
I Thessalonians 2:14 For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea which are in Christ Jesus; for you, also, have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, that they have suffered from the Jews,
I Thessalonians 2:15 who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and do not please God, and are opposed to all men,
I Thessalonians 2:16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, in order that they may fill up their sins at all times: but the wrath is coming upon them to the full. <div eID="gen1389" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1390" type="x-p"/>
I Thessalonians 2:17 But we, brethren, having been taken from you for a short time, in person, not in heart, did, with great desire, endeavor the more earnestly to see your face.
I Thessalonians 2:18 For this reason, we intended to go to you, (I Paul) both once and again, but Satan hindered us.
I Thessalonians 2:19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? You indeed are our glory and joy.  <chapter eID="1Thess.2"/> <div eID="gen1390" type="x-p"/>

I Thessalonians 3:1 Wherefore, being no longer able to contain ourselves, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
I Thessalonians 3:2 and we sent Timothy our brother and minister of God in the gospel of the Christ, in order that he might strengthen and comfort you with respect to your faith,
I Thessalonians 3:3 that no one be moved by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this:
I Thessalonians 3:4 for even when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, as it also came to pass, and as you know.
I Thessalonians 3:5 For this reason, when I could no longer contain myself, I sent to know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain. <div eID="gen1391" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1392" type="x-p"/>
I Thessalonians 3:6 But now, since Timothy has come to us from you, and has told us the good news of your faith and love, and that you have a good remembrance of us at all times, greatly desiring to see us, as indeed we desire to see you,
I Thessalonians 3:7 for this reason we are comforted concerning you, brethren, in all our distress and affliction, by your faith:
I Thessalonians 3:8 for now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
I Thessalonians 3:9 For what thanks can we render to God for you, for the great joy with which we rejoice on your account before our God,

I Thessalonians 4:1 Finally, then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you, by our Lord Jesus, that as you learned from us how you ought to walk and please God, you would abound more and more.
I Thessalonians 4:2 For you know what commandments we gave you by our Lord Jesus.
I Thessalonians 4:3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you keep yourselves from lewdness;
I Thessalonians 4:4 That each one of you know how to keep his vessel in sanctification and in honor,
I Thessalonians 4:5 not in passionate desire, as the Gentiles do, who know not God;
I Thessalonians 4:6 That no one take advantage of or injure his brother in this matter; because the Lord takes vengeance for all such things, as we also told you before, and fully testified:
I Thessalonians 4:7 for God has not called us for uncleanness, but for holiness.
I Thessalonians 4:8 Therefore, he that despises, despises not man, but God, who has given us his Holy Spirit. <div eID="gen1394" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1395" type="x-p"/>
I Thessalonians 4:9 But with respect to brotherly love, you have no need that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
I Thessalonians 4:10 and indeed you do this to all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that you abound <transChange type="added">in love</transChange> more and more,
I Thessalonians 4:11 and that you earnestly endeavor to live quietly, and that you attend to your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
I Thessalonians 4:12 in order that you may walk with propriety toward those who are without, and may have need of nothing. <div eID="gen1395" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1396" type="x-p"/>
I Thessalonians 4:13 But concerning those who have fallen asleep, I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that you may not grieve, as others who have no hope.
I Thessalonians 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also <transChange type="added">should we believe that</transChange> God will, through Jesus, bring with him those who sleep.
I Thessalonians 4:15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we, the living, who remain till the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who are asleep
I Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall arise first;
I Thessalonians 4:17 then we, the living who remain, shall, together with them, be caught up in clouds into the air to meet the Lord, and so shall we be ever with the Lord.

II Thessalonians 3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly, and not according to the tradition which he received from us.

II Thessalonians 3:8 nor did we eat any one’s bread for nothing: but worked with labor and toil, night and day, that we might not burden any one of you;
II Thessalonians 3:9 this we did, not because we have not authority, but that we might give ourselves to you as an example, in order that you might imitate us.

II Thessalonians 3:13 And you, brethren, should not be weary in well-doing.

Titus 1:13 This testimony is true; wherefore rebuke them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,

Philemon 1:10 I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,
Philemon 1:11 who, for some time, has been unprofitable to you, but now is very profitable to you and to me:
Philemon 1:12 I send him back, and do you receive him, that is, my son.
Philemon 1:13 I did wish to keep him with me, that, in your stead, he might serve me in my bonds for the gospel;

Philemon 1:17 If, then, you regard me as a partner, receive him as myself.
Philemon 1:18 But if he has done you any wrong, or owes you any thing, put that to my account.
Philemon 1:19 I, Paul, do write it with my own hand, I will repay it; that I may not say to you, that you owe to me even yourself besides.
Philemon 1:20 Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my heart in the Lord.
Philemon 1:21 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
Philemon 1:22 At the same time, also, prepare me a lodging: for I hope that through the prayers of you all, I may be given to you.

Hebrews 1:1 God, who in many parts and in many ways spoke in ancient times to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by his Son,
Hebrews 1:2 whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom, also, he made the ages;
Hebrews 1:3 who, being the effulgence of his glory and the exact representation of his essence, and upholding all things by his own powerful word, when he had by himself made expiation for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
Hebrews 1:4 having become so far superior to the angels, as the name which he has inherited is more excellent than theirs. <div eID="gen1489" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1490" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 1:5 For to which of the angels did he at any time say: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
Hebrews 1:6 And again, when he brings the first-begotten into the world, he says: And let all the angels of God worship him.
Hebrews 1:7 And of the angels he says: Who makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire.
Hebrews 1:8 But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is from age to age: a scepter of rectitude is the scepter of thy kingdom.
Hebrews 1:9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore, God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Hebrews 1:10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning, didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
Hebrews 1:11 They shall perish; but thou remainest: and they all shall grow old as a garment;

Hebrews 2:1 Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest we let them glide away.
Hebrews 2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,
Hebrews 2:3 how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? which at first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard him;
Hebrews 2:4 God also bearing testimony with them by signs and wonders, and by various mighty deeds, and by distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will. <div eID="gen1492" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1493" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 2:5 For not to angels has he subjected the world to come of which we speak.
Hebrews 2:6 But one in a certain place testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the son of man, that thou dost visit him?
Hebrews 2:7 Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honor;
Hebrews 2:8 thou hast put all things under his feet. For, in putting all things under him, he left nothing that is not put under him: but now we do not yet see all things put under him.
Hebrews 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that he might, by the grace of God, taste death for every man―we see him, on account of his having suffered death, crowned with glory and honor.
Hebrews 2:10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. <div eID="gen1493" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1494" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 2:11 For both he that sanctifies, and those who are sanctified, are all of one Father: for which reason, he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:

Hebrews 2:13 And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold, I, and the children that God has given me.
Hebrews 2:14 Since, then, the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also, in like manner, partook of the same, that, through his death, he might deprive of power him that has the power of death, that is, the devil;
Hebrews 2:15 and might set free those who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews 2:16 For, verily, he does not take hold of angels, but he takes hold of the posterity of Abraham.
Hebrews 2:17 Wherefore, it behooved him to be made like his brethren in all things, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, in order to make expiation for the sins of the people.

Hebrews 3:3 For this man is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has builded the house, has more honor than the house.
Hebrews 3:4 For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
Hebrews 3:5 And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, to bear testimony to those things which were to be spoken afterward;

Hebrews 3:7 Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says: To-day, if you will hear his voice,

Hebrews 3:9 where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
Hebrews 3:10 Where fore, I was angry with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
Hebrews 3:11 so that I swore in my anger, They shall not enter into my rest.
Hebrews 3:12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in apostatizing from the living God.
Hebrews 3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
Hebrews 3:14 For we are partakers of the Christ, if we hold our begun confidence firm to the end;
Hebrews 3:15 while it is said, To-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation.
Hebrews 3:16 For some, when they had heard, did bitterly provoke; yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
Hebrews 3:17 But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews 3:18 But to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who believed not?

Hebrews 4:1 Let us fear, therefore, lest, as a promise of entering into his rest still remains, any of you should seem to come short of it.
Hebrews 4:2 For we have had the good news preached to us, even as they had: but the word preached did not profit them, for it was not mixed with faith in those who heard it.
Hebrews 4:3 For we who have believed are to enter into rest, as he said: So I swore in my anger, they shall not enter into my rest; namely, <transChange type="added">that rest from</transChange> his works which had been finished from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews 4:4 For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day, thus: And God did rest on the seventh day from all his works;
Hebrews 4:5 and in this place again: They shall not enter into my rest. <div eID="gen1497" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1498" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 4:6 Since, then, it remains that some must enter into it, and they, to whom the good news was first preached, did not enter in on account of unbelief,
Hebrews 4:7 again, he determines a certain day, saying in David, after so long a time, To-day, as it is said, To-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
Hebrews 4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not, after this, have spoken of another day.
Hebrews 4:9 There remains, therefore, a sabbath-state for the people of God.
Hebrews 4:10 For he that has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his. <div eID="gen1498" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1499" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 4:11 Let us earnestly strive, therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any one fall after the same example of unbelief.
Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Hebrews 4:13 And there is no creature which is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked, and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account. <div eID="gen1499" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1500" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 4:14 Seeing, then, that we have a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
Hebrews 4:15 For we have not a high priest that can not sympathize with our infirmities; but he was tempted in all things like ourselves, yet without sin.
Hebrews 4:16 Let us come, therefore, with boldness, to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in every time of need.  <chapter eID="Heb.4"/> <div eID="gen1500" type="x-p"/>

Hebrews 5:1 For every high priest chosen from among men, is appointed for men, in things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:
Hebrews 5:2 being able to have compassion on the ignorant and erring, because he himself is beset with infirmity:
Hebrews 5:3 and on account of this, he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to make offering for sins.
Hebrews 5:4 And no one takes this honor to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron also was called.
Hebrews 5:5 So, also, the Christ did not take upon himself the honor of becoming a high priest: but he <transChange type="added">gave him this honor</transChange>, who said to him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:
Hebrews 5:6 as he says also in another place, Thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec. <div eID="gen1501" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1502" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 5:7 In the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard with respect to that which he feared,
Hebrews 5:8 although he was a Son, he yet learned obedience from the things which he suffered;
Hebrews 5:9 and, having been made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him,
Hebrews 5:10 being called by God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec. <div eID="gen1502" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1503" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 5:11 Of him we have many things to say, and difficult to be explained, if we do say them, since you are slow in understanding.
Hebrews 5:12 For though you ought to be teachers, considering the time, yet you have need that some one teach you again what are the first elements of the oracles of God; and you have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food.
Hebrews 5:13 For every one that partakes of milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
Hebrews 5:14 But strong food belongs to those who are of mature age, who, by use, have their internal senses exercised to the discerning of both good and evil.  <chapter eID="Heb.5"/> <div eID="gen1503" type="x-p"/>

Hebrews 6:1 Therefore, omitting the elementary Christian teaching, let us go on to the perfection <transChange type="added">of Christian instruction</transChange>, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
Hebrews 6:2 of the teaching with respect to immersions, and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal condemnation.
Hebrews 6:3 And this we will do, if God permit.
Hebrews 6:4 For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
Hebrews 6:5 and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the coming age,
Hebrews 6:6 if they fall away; since they again crucify in themselves the Son of God, and put him to an open shame. <div eID="gen1504" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1505" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 6:7 For the land which drinks up the rain that comes often upon it, and produces herbs suitable for those for whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God.

Hebrews 6:9 But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, and of things that tend to salvation, though we thus speak.
Hebrews 6:10 For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shown for his name by having ministered to the saints, and by continuing to minister. <div eID="gen1506" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1507" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 6:11 But we desire every one of you to show the same diligence, in order to have your hope fully assured to the end:
Hebrews 6:12 that you may not become slothful, but imitators of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.
Hebrews 6:13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
Hebrews 6:14 saying: Most surely will I abundantly bless you, and abundantly multiply you.
Hebrews 6:15 And so, when he had waited patiently, he received the promises.
Hebrews 6:16 For, verily, men swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all contradiction. <div eID="gen1507" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1508" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 6:17 Wherefore, God, being more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of his promise the immutability of his purpose, interposed an oath,
Hebrews 6:18 that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us;
Hebrews 6:19 which, hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters in beyond the vail,
Hebrews 6:20 whither a forerunner for us has gone, even Jesus, who is made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.  <chapter eID="Heb.6"/> <div eID="gen1508" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:0 <milestone n="VII." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen1509" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="7" osisID="Heb.7" sID="Heb.7"/>
Hebrews 7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
Hebrews 7:2 to whom also Abraham gave a tenth of all, being, first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then, also, King of Salem, which means King of peace,
Hebrews 7:3 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but being made to resemble the Son of God, remains a priest forever. <div eID="gen1509" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1510" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.
Hebrews 7:5 And those of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
Hebrews 7:6 but he who does not count his genealogy from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
Hebrews 7:7 And, without any contradiction, the less is blessed by the better. <div eID="gen1510" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1511" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:8 And in the one instance, men that die receive tithes; but in the other, he receives them who has the testimony that he lives.
Hebrews 7:9 And so to speak, even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham;
Hebrews 7:10 for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. <div eID="gen1511" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1512" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:11 If, then, there had been a perfect expiation by means of the Levitical priesthood, (for with reference to it, the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should be raised up after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
Hebrews 7:12 It is evident that, when the priest hood is changed, there is of necessity a change also of the law.
Hebrews 7:13 For he of whom these things are said, belongs to another tribe, from which no one attended upon the altar.
Hebrews 7:14 For it is very clear that our Lord sprung from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. <div eID="gen1512" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1513" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:15 And it is yet far more evident, if, after the likeness of Melchisedec, there arises another priest,
Hebrews 7:16 who is made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life; for he testifies,
Hebrews 7:17 Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec. <div eID="gen1513" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1514" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:18 For, indeed, there is a setting aside of the preceding commandment, because it was weak and unprofitable,
Hebrews 7:19 (for the law made no perfect expiation), and the introduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.
Hebrews 7:20 And inasmuch as he was made a priest, not without an oath,
Hebrews 7:21 (for those priests were made such without an oath, but this one with an oath, by him that said to him, The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec;)
Hebrews 7:22 in so much has Jesus become the surety of a better covenant. <div eID="gen1514" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1515" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:23 And those priests, indeed, have been many, because they were prevented by death from continuing <transChange type="added">in office</transChange>.
Hebrews 7:24 But this man, because he continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.
Hebrews 7:25 Wherefore, he is able also to save through all time those who come to God by him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. <div eID="gen1515" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1516" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 7:26 For such a high priest is suited to us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;
Hebrews 7:27 who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
Hebrews 7:28 For the law makes men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, makes the Son, who is perfected forever.  <chapter eID="Heb.7"/> <div eID="gen1516" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 8:0 <milestone n="VIII." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen1517" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="8" osisID="Heb.8" sID="Heb.8"/>
Hebrews 8:1 Now concerning the things that have been spoken, the principal point is <transChange type="added">this</transChange>: We have such a high priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
Hebrews 8:2 a minister of the holy places, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. <div eID="gen1517" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1518" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 8:3 For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore, it is necessary that this one also have something which he may offer.
Hebrews 8:4 For if he were on earth, he could not be a priest; because there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
Hebrews 8:5 and these serve the copy and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: See now, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern shown you in the mount.
Hebrews 8:6 But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the mediator of a better covenant, which is established with reference to better promises. <div eID="gen1518" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1519" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.
Hebrews 8:8 For, finding fault with them, he says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will ratify a new covenant for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah:
Hebrews 8:9 not like the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
Hebrews 8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, says the Lord; putting my laws into their understanding, I will also write them upon their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;
Hebrews 8:11 and they shall not teach, every one his citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest;
Hebrews 8:12 because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more. <div eID="gen1519" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1520" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 8:13 In saying, A new covenant, he has regarded the first as out of use. Now, that which is out of use, and has become old, is ready to disappear.  <chapter eID="Heb.8"/> <div eID="gen1520" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 9:0 <milestone n="IX." type="x-chapterLabel"/> <div sID="gen1521" type="x-p"/> <chapter n="9" osisID="Heb.9" sID="Heb.9"/>
Hebrews 9:1 Now, the first covenant also had ordinances of worship, and the worldly sanctuary:
Hebrews 9:2 for a tabernacle was constructed, the first, in which were the candlestick, and the table, and the presence bread; and this tabernacle is called holy.
Hebrews 9:3 But after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies;
Hebrews 9:4 which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that held the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
Hebrews 9:5 and over the ark, the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we can not now speak particularly. <div eID="gen1521" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1522" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 9:6 Now, when these things were thus arranged, the priests went, at all times, into the first tabernacle, discharging the service of God.
Hebrews 9:7 But into the second, the high priest alone went, once during the year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
Hebrews 9:8 the Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way into the most holy was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was still standing,
Hebrews 9:9 which, as a symbol, <transChange type="added">remains</transChange> to the present time, in which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that can not make perfect, as it respects the conscience, him that does the service;
Hebrews 9:10 <transChange type="added">since he relies</transChange> only on meats and drinks and various immersions, ordinances indeed of the flesh, which were imposed till the time of reformation. <div eID="gen1522" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1523" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 9:11 But Christ, having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, (that is, not of this building,)
Hebrews 9:12 entered, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, once for all, into the most holy, having obtained eternal redemption.
Hebrews 9:13 For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, cleanses them as it respects the purity of the flesh,
Hebrews 9:14 how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works, in order that you may serve the living God? <div eID="gen1523" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1524" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 9:15 And for this reason, he is the mediator of the new covenant: that, since his death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions that were under the former covenant, those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
Hebrews 9:16 For where a testament is, it is necessary that there be brought in the death of the testator:
Hebrews 9:17 for a testament goes into effect after men are dead: seeing that it has no validity at all while the testator lives. <div eID="gen1524" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1525" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 9:18 Wherefore, the first covenant was not instituted without blood.
Hebrews 9:19 For when Moses had spoken to all the people every commandment of the law, lie took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying:
Hebrews 9:20 This is the blood of the covenant which God enjoins on you:
Hebrews 9:21 and, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the service.
Hebrews 9:22 And, indeed, according to the law, almost all things are cleansed by blood; and without the shedding of blood there is no remission. <div eID="gen1525" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1526" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 9:23 It was necessary, therefore, that the copies of the things in the heavens should be consecrated by these sacrifices; but that the heavenly things themselves should be consecrated by better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews 9:24 For the Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, the copies of the true; but he has entered heaven itself, now to present himself in the presence of God for us.
Hebrews 9:25 Nor <transChange type="added">has he entered</transChange>, that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with the blood of another:
Hebrews 9:26 for then, he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once in the end of the ages, he has appeared in order to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews 9:27 And, as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this the judgment,
Hebrews 9:28 so the Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to those who look for him he will appear the second time, without a sin-offering, in order to salvation.  <chapter eID="Heb.9"/> <div eID="gen1526" type="x-p"/>

Hebrews 10:1 For the law, having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never, with the same sacrifices, which they offer year by year continually, make a perfect expiation for those who come to them:
Hebrews 10:2 for then, would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshipers, after being once cleansed, would no longer have a consciousness of sins.
Hebrews 10:3 There is, however, in these sacrifices, a remembrance of sins every year. <div eID="gen1527" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1528" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 10:4 For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Hebrews 10:5 Wherefore, when he comes into the world, he says: Sacrifice and offering thou hast not desired, but a body thou hast prepared me;
Hebrews 10:6 in whole burnt-offerings and offerings for sin, thou hast had no pleasure.
Hebrews 10:7 Then, said I, Behold, I come, (in the roll of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
Hebrews 10:8 After saying above, Thou didst neither desire, nor take pleasure in sacrifice and offering and whole burnt-offerings and offerings for sin, which are offered according to the law,
Hebrews 10:9 then he said, Behold, I come to do thy will: he takes away the first, that he may establish the second.
Hebrews 10:10 By which will, we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time. <div eID="gen1528" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1529" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 10:11 And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
Hebrews 10:12 but after offering one sacrifice for sins, he himself sits continually at the right hand of God,
Hebrews 10:13 henceforth waiting till his enemies be made his footstool.
Hebrews 10:14 For by one offering, he has made a perfect and perpetual expiation for the sanctified. <div eID="gen1529" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1530" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 10:15 And, indeed, the Holy Spirit is a witness for us. For after he had said before,
Hebrews 10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; putting my laws in their hearts, I will also write them in their understandings:
Hebrews 10:17 he adds, And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.
Hebrews 10:18 Now, where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. <div eID="gen1530" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1531" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 10:19 Having therefore, brethren, confidence to enter the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews 10:20 by a new and living way which he has dedicated for us, through the vail, that is, his flesh;
Hebrews 10:21 and having a great high, priest over the house of God,
Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having; our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water;
Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the unwavering confession of our hope, for he is faithful who has promised;
Hebrews 10:24 and let us consider one another that we may excite to love and good works,
Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom of some; but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching. <div eID="gen1531" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1532" type="x-p"/>
Hebrews 10:26 For if we sin willfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no longer a sacrifice for sins;
Hebrews 10:27 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and a fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries.
Hebrews 10:28 He that despised Moses law, died without mercy, on the testimony of two or three witnesses:
Hebrews 10:29 of how much severer punishment do you think he shall be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, a common thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews 10:30 For we know him who has said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.

Hebrews 10:32 But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;
Hebrews 10:33 partly, while you became a public spectacle, by reproaches and afflictions: partly, while you became partakers with those who were so treated.
Hebrews 10:34 For you sympathized with me in my bonds, and endured joyfully the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and abiding substance in the heavens.

James 2:1 My brethren, do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, so as to show a partiality for persons.
James 2:2 For if there comes into your assembly a man in splendid apparel, and with gold rings on his fingers, and there comes in also a poor man, in mean clothing,
James 2:3 and you show regard to him that wears the splendid apparel, and say to him, Sit here, in an honorable place; and you say to the poor man, Do you stand there, or sit here, under my footstool;
James 2:4 are you not partial in yourselves? and do you not judge from false principles?
James 2:5 Hear, my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God has promised to those who love him?
James 2:6 But you dishonor the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and do they not themselves drag you to the judgment-seats?
James 2:7 Do they not themselves revile that honorable name which is called upon you?
James 2:8 If, however, you fulfill the law of highest excellence, according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well.
James 2:9 But if you show partiality for persons, you work sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. <div eID="gen1576" type="x-p"/> <div sID="gen1577" type="x-p"/>

James 2:17 So, also, faith, if it has not works, is dead, being by itself.
James 2:18 But some one will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith by your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
James 2:19 You believe that there is one God; you do well: the demons also believe, and tremble.
